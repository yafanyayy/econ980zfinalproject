As we start to review the financials, we've got several objectives we like to accomplish.

As we start to review the financials, we've got several objectives we like to accomplish. The first of all is the clear understanding of our recent actions, along with the associated charges; next to provide you with some insight on our operational cash performance in the quarter; and lastly, to provide commentary on our 2012 cash sustainability targets. 
With that being said, let's turn to the fourth quarter. Our loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $193 million or $0.18 per share. Restructuring and other special items totaled a negative $159 million, which brings us to a loss of $0.03 per share. In just a second, I'll detail the restructuring special items for you. 
A 13% drop in the LME, combined with continued European weakness, contributed to the decrease in revenues on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 6% despite an 11% drop in LME as the aerospace, automotive and commercial transportation markets all showed greater than 20% increases in revenue. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $656 million, bringing the cash generated this year to $906 million. We achieved the lowest days working capital in our history at 27 days or 3 days lower than our previous record set in 2010, roughly equivalent to $200 million in cash. Remember, this is on top of the 13-day improvement achieved in the previous 2 years. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio stood at 35% or flat with the fourth quarter of 2010, despite a one percentage point increase related to pension plan discount rates. During the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $547 million, and liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.9 billion. Lastly, we achieved all of our 2011 cash sustainability targets as we continue to improve liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet. 
Now let's move to the income statement. Loss for the quarter of $0.18 per share was primarily driven by restructuring and other charges which I will detail in the next slide. The COGS and SG&A percent of sales increases were essentially driven by declining revenue, which was a function of the falling metal prices. Our factored tax rate in the quarter was 31% or 36% excluding discrete items. This brings our year-to-date operational tax rate to 24%. With increasing uncertainty across our markets, we will continue to experience swings in the rate as profit drivers with each taxing jurisdiction remain volatile. In 2012, we expect our ETR run rate to be approximately 27%. 
Let's now move on to a review of the special items in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and special items in the fourth quarter totaled an unfavorable $159 million. As announced last week, we've taken decisive actions to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons of smelting capacity. These closures and curtailments represent $141 million of the total restructuring charges. The remaining restructuring relates to headcount reductions in other businesses and an asset write-off in Australia. 
The other special items in the quarter were favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on energy contracts and a gain on the sale of land in Australia. These 2 were completely offset by discrete tax items associated with legislative actions in various jurisdictions and uninsured losses primarily due to flooding at our Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania facility. 
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. The negative net impact of LME and currency for the quarter was $125 million, driven primarily by a sequential drop in metal prices of 13%. Ongoing productivity improvements across our businesses were insufficient to overcome slowing market conditions and prevailing cost headwinds. However, we were able to maintain our rate of productivity improvements on a sequential basis and captured $221 million of improved productivity compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
To get a clearer understanding of these significant movements, let's move on to the segment bridges, and we'll start off with Alumina. While our Alumina business is experiencing significant pressure due to falling market prices, our performance actions have more than offset raw material and cost increases. Alumina production increased this quarter by 1% sequentially, achieving a new quarterly production record driven by Point Comfort in Australia. Market effects for the quarter were almost entirely driven by changes in LME, and they lowered profitability by $94 million. Prior index pricing and our focus on productivity drove a $53 million increase in performance. 
Energy moderated for us during the quarter while costs have continued to have a negative impact on our cost due to its 3- to 6-month lag. We are beginning to see a softening in certain regions in the caustic market, and as a result, expect to see lower prices which will begin to improve results by the second quarter. 
Lastly for the fourth quarter, we sold a plot of land in Australia, which contributed $30 million. Looking to the first quarter, we anticipate 33% of our third-party shipments will be on spot or Alumina index basis. The first quarter is also when we undergo significant maintenance in Australian operations, which will impact the segment results by $20 million. Raw material inflation will continue in the first quarter, and as you have come to expect, we will fight for every productivity dollar available. 
Let's now move to the Primary segment. In Primary Metals, we continued to experience significant headwinds in our business. Production was flat, third-party shipments were up 7% sequentially, and realized pricing was down 12%. Effects of regional premiums on the quarter were muted as the mix of our product sales improved from Q3. However, as we look towards next quarter, this will have an increase impact in our realized price. We were able to generate $21 million in performance improvements this quarter to partially mitigate the higher costs. Energy and raw materials reduced profitability $36 million as we experienced the planned outage at our Rockdale energy facility, and we continued to see the impact of rising carbon and alumina prices. 
We managed our working capital to a record level. We dropped 7 days from last quarter and 4 days from the year-ago quarter. As we look to Q1, we will see the full impact of falling regional premiums, as well as a number of seasonal effects in our energy costs. In raw material prices, we are seeing important signs of improvements in the market. Our announced curtailments, as well as a number of other global reductions in supply, had taken regional supply demand balance for calcite and coke from short to long. While we do not expect to see a strong impact in the first quarter due to inventory flows, we do believe this will provide relief in the following quarter. 
Now let's move to Global Roll Products. The story for Global Roll Products this quarter was volume. Seasonal beverage can volume declined as expected in North America and Russia, with volumes down 12% and 23%, respectively. European demand also continue to remain weak in the fourth quarter, with a 16% drop from Q3. Aerospace and automotive demand remain stable. This segment was also negatively impacted by customer credit losses. We continue to drive productivity improvements across the business, and in spite of the lower volumes, generated $4 million in savings. This segment had a record quarter in free cash flow while continuing to invest in growth projects, and they were able to reduce their working capital an astounding 10 days sequentially. 
Other progress was made towards our 2013 $2.5 billion incremental revenue target. In fact, we've already achieved 55% of our targeted increase in 2011. Next quarter, we expect to see continued demand strengthen aerospace and automotive and seasonal increases in packaging. Our outlook in Europe remains soft. 
Now let's turn to Engineered Products and Solutions. While down sequentially, Engineered Products and Solutions delivered another solid quarter. Revenue was slightly down quarter-over-quarter and improved by $140 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Profitability declined sequentially but increased by $9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our year-over-year improvement has been driven by management actions to improve our portfolio that better leverage the strengths of our innovative products. Productivity improvements was slightly offset by cost increases during the quarter, driven by our Cleveland press outage and lower yield in certain businesses. We remain on target towards a 2013 incremental revenue target of $1.6 billion. We achieved 48% of the increase in 2011. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate incremental improvements in all of our markets, with the exception of commercial transportation in Europe and building and construction in Europe and North America. We also anticipate better quarter-over-quarter productivity gains. 
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. We ended the fourth quarter with exceptional cash results. We generated cash from operations of $1.1 billion, more than $650 million improvement over last quarter. This improvement was driven by significant reductions in working capital. We currently stand at 27 days, which is 11 days lower on a sequential basis and 3 days lower than last year. Free cash flow in quarter was $656 million, bringing the full year to $906 million. And debt-to-capital increased to 35%, primarily due to lower discount rates that impacted the re-measurement of our pension plan obligations. With $1.9 billion cash on hand, we move forward into 2002 (sic)  with a strong liquidity position. And if we could, let's take a step back, take a look at our businesses on a full year basis.
On a quarterly basis, each of our businesses face challenges ranging from lower realized prices to market weakness and rising costs. However, when you examine the full year results, it shows strong performance and in most cases exceeded prior year results. Alumina not only finished the year with higher EBITDA per ton but also exceeded the historical average of $66 per ton. We move to alumina index pricing for approximately 20% of third-party shipments helped the business achieved year-over-year improvements in the face of difficult market conditions. 
In Primary Metals, EBITDA per metric ton was lower than prior year as the segment faced cost headwinds and significantly declining prices in the second half. We've reacted to this situation by aggressively reacting to shutter uncompetitive plants permanently and to curtail locations with higher power. 
Global Rolled Products business faced challenges in the second half of 2011 due to demand destruction from market weakness in Europe and expected fourth quarter seasonal declines. However, year-over-year performance has improved on an EBITDA per metric ton basis, exceeding both prior year as well as both historical average. It's also important to note that Global Rolled Products achieved 55% of the 2013 revenue growth target in year one. 
Engineered Products and Solutions finished the year with 18% EBITDA margins, our best performance ever. At Global Rolled products, Engineered Products also made great strides against their 2013 target, achieving 48% in the first year. Overall, a challenging second half driven by declining prices and rising costs but our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth and managing cash. 
Now let's turn to the year-over-year bridge. Total cost increases of $1 billion created significant headwinds to our operations. While there was raw material inflation, ramp-up issues, pottery lining or maintenance overhaul, we battled the entire year to offset these increases. We did so through actions designed to increase market share, improve pricing as well as our mix of products and generate ideas in our operations which led to significant productivity improvements. These actions essentially overcame the higher cost and allowed the net benefit of higher prices and currency to hit the bottom line. 
Now let's move on to the full year cash flow. 2011 was another solid year in terms of generating cash and improving liquidity. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion, which included $336 million in pension contributions. Capital expenditures for the year were roughly $1.3 billion or $213 million below our target. After generating $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2010, we generated another $906 million in 2011. The formula for success continues to be solid operating performance and disciplined capital management. 
Underpinning the operating performance is the exceptional performance in working capital, which is demonstrated on the next slide. We continue to make tremendous progress in achieving sustained improvement in our days working capital. In 2011, we established new record 27 days. We've been able to reduce days working capital by 16 days, an equivalent of $1.1 billion since 2008 and 3 days since 2010. A one-year improvement equates to roughly $200 million in cash. 
These results demonstrated not only an improvement but a sustainable reduction. Stable operating practices and a relentless focus on cash has been the hallmark of our businesses. As you will see from our 2012 targets, we're going to continue this effort. 
Now let's move on to a report on our 2011 financial targets. For the third consecutive year, we've achieved all of our cash sustainability targets. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital spending, which is demonstrated by our results in both sustaining and growth CapEx. Our investment in the Ma’aden Alcoa joint venture also came in below target at $249 million. Construction is progressing as planned and continue to be on schedule and on budget. Debt-to-capital remains at our target range, and we achieved our goal of being free cash flow positive, ending the year with $906 million. These results have us starting 2012 in an improved liquidity position, as shown on the next slide. 
As you can see, our performance has improved markedly from the end of 2008 time period. First, we have significantly improved our free cash flow generation and had been free cash flow positive for the last 2 years. We've been disciplined in our capital spending while still investing in growth opportunities. We've been able to significantly improve our liquidity by maintaining significant cash on hand. At the same time, we have reduced our debt position by more than $1.2 billion and our net debt position by $2.4 billion. We've also reduced our debt-to-capital by more than 700 basis points. 
One area that has generated increased concern has been the funding of our pension plan. With that in mind, let's take a look at the next slide and we'll discuss that topic. Despite a challenging investment environment, Alcoa increased the market value of its assets with an estimated 9% return in 2011. Our pension contributions continue to meet their RESA 80% threshold for funding requirements. We have historically used cash to fund pension obligations, with the exception being 2010 and 2011. Even in this timeframe, we contributed $449 million in cash. We're anticipating the use of cash to fund 2012 requirements. Through the economic conditions change, we will obviously reassess our options. 
Let's now move on to our 2012 view and cash sustainability targets. In the second half of 2011, we faced headwinds influenced by the volatile economic environment. As a result, we ended 2012 managing for cash. I've just elaborated on where we stand from a liquidity position. That our goal as we entered 2012 is to utilize these categories of capacity optimization, the cost and productivity gains, working capital and liquidity initiatives to enable us to finish the year cash flow positive. We set our targets to accomplish this overarching objective, which are listed on the next page. 
Alcoa will focus on maximizing cash in 2012, and the following targets had been established as part of our new cash sustainability program. We've already discussed the capacity optimization targets and announced we will close or curtail roughly 12% of Alcoa's global smelting capacity. We have a target to capture productivity gains of $800 million and overhead savings of $50 million in 2012. Even though we set a record on days working capital, we set a goal to achieve another 1.5-day reduction over 2011. 
Alcoa will target positive free cash flow in 2012 to follow a disciplined approach to capital spending, with specific targets established for sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx and spend on the Ma’aden Alcoa JV investment. Lastly is our debt-to-capital target. We will continue to manage our capital structure and maintain a ratio in the range of 30% to 35%. 
Ever since the downturn of '08 and '09, we have taken a very disciplined and aggressive approach in managing for cash. As we enter 2012, we are positioned and committed to meeting the challenge of this current environment. With that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Klaus."

Let's go to the market and then the Alcoa performance and then we go into 2012. So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong in",4212,"Well, thank you, Chuck. So let's start with a short review of 2011. Let's go to the market and then the Alcoa performance and then we go into 2012. 
So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong into the year and weakened in the second half. If you may remember, we projected originally 12% growth. We believe the market has finished with a growth rate of 10% in the last year so that's where it leaves us. 
Let's go to the supply demand picture for 2011 and also close that. So on the left-hand side, you see the primary aluminum side. The market has ended with a slight surplus of 150,000 tons, and the Alumina market, as we projected, is in balance, supply demand situation. 
So let's move on to the 2011 Alcoa performance. And can we have the next chart, please? As you see there, the 4 major segments, right, you see on the Alumina side, the EBITDA per metric ton finished 2011 stronger than 2010, with $70 as slightly above the historic average of $66. Various sectors have contributed to the aluminum price index, introducing a market pricing system certainly one of those and our strategic investments helped to improve our business despite very difficult market conditions. The primary metal side to the lower left corner here, the EBITDA per metric ton lower than the prior year basically due to cost headwinds and a substantial price decline in the second half of the year, it basically underlines the importance of our strategic targets as those that follow us for a longer time. Remember last year, we've put out a 10% improvement -- 10 percentage point improvement on the cost curve target in the next 5 years for our primary business, and this is well underway and as it shows here, it's really important. 
The recent curtailment actions also clearly show our commitment to this, and we have also learned a lot to respond quickly and cashed sensitively in the changing market conditions. This is an important skill that we've acquired in the 2008, 2009 timeframe, particularly in today's very volatile time. 
If you look at the Flat Rolled upper right-hand corner, we face challenges from the second half of the year, with the demand destruction in Europe. However, as you look at the annual performance, it had improved compared to the last year with the EBITDA per metric ton and it's about historic levels. So in addition, what you can see here on this slide value tell you is Flat-Rolled Products also have a strategic target to grow $2.5 billion until 2013, and it's achieved 50% of that in the first year. 
Engineered Products and Solutions business improved margins here, reached 18% EBITDA margin for the full year. This is all our best ever performance. This also showed great performance on the growth side. There is a strategic target to grow $1.6 billion in the 3 years after 2013, and they've achieved 40% of that in the first year. So if you look at the start alone, which tells a good story of what has happened in 2011, so the business have remain very focused on profitable growth and like in the last downturn, we do not let their eye off the strategic directions. 
And let me just quickly give you some views on what has happened on the strategic side there, starting with Primary. Our new bauxite mine in Juruti, Brazil, improved production by more than 50%. At the same time cash came down by 30%. The refinery São Luis is now at nameplate capacity with 3.5 million tons. Our Hydro Graham is also in Brazil for the contractual build, 4 of 8 turbines are in place, will be completed this year and it will give us 277 megawatts in this year, will bring our costs down on the cost curve for the worldwide system by one percentage point. This action alone, that's a good thing in our Saudi Arabia joint venture. Here are some recent pictures. It's the lowest cost as you may remember, and as you can see here, it's nicely coming out of the ground, it's on-time, it's on budget and that's an important thing to see and very important for our strategic direction. 
ERP on the Global Rolled Products side, also been focusing nicely on our growth regions and nicely on some of the growth segments. Russia, as I want to highlight their 20% -- 23% year-on-year volume growth. It's when you look at -- when you look at 2008 to today, $150 million turnaround in profits. When you look at China also, capacity utilization coming up 70%. We expect by 2012, we are a good player in some of the key markets, already in breeding sheets and we are going into other growing markets like consumer electronics. That's a good thing. And then talking about Davenport. Davenport is strongly profiting and looking forward to the growth in automotive, as well as the sustained growth and increased growth in aerospace. Last year, we announced a $300 million investment there to meet the U.S. auto demand. And on aerospace, we'd see clearly a growing capacity with higher build rate, and this very fundamental decision that was made in 2011 by Airbus to have the A320neo and by Boeing to have the 737 MACs as an all-aluminum plane. That's very, very important, right. 
However, last but not least, and when you see the strategic things on EPS. We continue to drive innovation and acquisitions as the major driver for our downstream profitable growth. On the innovation side, and we almost don't know where to start. We are #1 in fasteners. 90% of the fasteners are specialty fastener, 55% are patented. We're #1 in blades going into jet engines and gas turbine. We have a great innovative capability that's just mentioned the 3D radio airfoil cooling. And what is lead do it allows for higher temperatures in the chambers, and that basically means it increases the engine efficiency and brings the emission down at the same time. 
We are hugely the #1 in wheels. And just to give you an impression here, I mean, if you replace the aluminum wheels, the steel wheels with aluminum wheels here as an example, this alone can lead to a 3% to 4%, 5% fuel saving on a truck and trailer combination. EcoClean has made headlines actually but just very positively mentioned as one of the biggest innovations happening last year. It's an active façade. And if you have 10,000 square feet of EcoClean, it's the equivalent of the pollution reduction that you get from 80 trees per day. 
And in addition to that, we have the bolt-on acquisitions on the fasteners side from Republic. We expanded our footprint, 4% EBITDA margin improvement, 4 percentage points and 4% to 7% market share gains depending on where you go. Trico, the acquisition and the windows side increased our North American commercial window share by 18%. 
So that's it on the operational side. If you look here at the financial targets, and I don't want to go through all of them, we basically achieved all of them, achieved or overachieved all of them together with on the right-hand side, the strategic targets and that will continue. We're going strong into 2012, and we're well trained and capable to act fast and face up the challenging market conditions. 
So let's go into 2012 and the outlook. Again, we'd start with the end market perspective then we go to aluminum and Alumina and then we talk about the Alcoa action. 
So let's go into the end markets that we cater to. So we actually see on the global scale growth to be positive in 2012 in those end markets that we serve, and at the same time, there are still some specific headwinds in certain regions that will prevail so let's go through it in the usual way. 
Aerospace for 2012, we believe the positive momentum is going to continue. We expect 10% to 11% growth, driven strongly by these large commercial aircraft. We now have an increased confidence in the delivery rates because 2011 net orders came out to be 2,183 of our large commercial aircraft. That's obviously Boeing and Airbus together. This is the second highest in aviation history. The combined backlog of both firms now is at 8.2 years so I think there's good reason to be optimistic about that market. 
Automotive, another pretty good story, with the exception of Western Europe. We expect on a global basis to have growth between 3% to 8% so let's look in some of the major regions. North America. It looked in the summer as though we would see a slowdown but then the fourth quarter came on strong with 13.4 million vehicles. We expect this momentum to continue into 2012 and driven very strongly by the average vehicle age. That's currently at 10.6 years whereas the 10-year average is 9.4 years, so we anticipated growth here between 5% to 10% in 2012. 
One interesting aspect and I want to mention specific to our industry is that we've been seeing that the aspect of fuel efficiency plays a much, much more important role today on the consumer choice but it's different from what it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the consumer really only had a choice to scale down both for a vehicle on a lower class, but today, you have fuel-efficient choices in each segment. Light weighting obviously with aluminum plays an important role here, as a chase of 10% of fuel efficiency. So this different -- this changed consumer preference together with the strong fuel efficiency legislation drives the company -- the automotive companies into that type about direction. 
Automotive Europe. Sales in the European market, EU27 was down 2% in 2011, driven by positive momentum in Germany plus northeast in Europe but driven all of that compensated or overcompensated by the reduction in most other countries, France, Italy, Spain, U.K. altogether comes to a down with a combined 7% of these countries, driven by -- Given the strength and exports, the production is expected to be plus 5% in 2011, with a substantially weaker second half, and we expect for 2012 and overall production to be around 0% to minus 5%. 
On China automotive, we expect to have -- we except the China to achieve a gain of around 3% in 2011, impacted by the elimination of government stimulus, as well as new vehicle registration limits in some major cities. In 2012, we expect growth to be between 3% to 8%. 
In heavy trucks and trailer, the next segment in commercial transportation, we expect mixed results. In total, we believe growth between 2% to 5%, driven very much by North America and China. North America commercial trucks and trailer, we do see a total 305,000 units for 2011 so that's up 69% compared to the year before. Production has increased by 64%. We're still positive for this sector. However, we agree with the industry consensus for 2012 of a growth between 2% and 7%. 
Europe commercial transportation 2011 has brought roughly 28% growth. The second half was weak. Actually, a production decline of 19%. We've seen austerity measures as well as the overall economic issues on the Eurozone are impacting this market obviously. We anticipate a production decline between 8% to 13% in 2012. 
In China, the Chinese commercial truck market has substantially come down from this enormous high of one million vehicles in 2010, 865,000 trucks in 2011. We're looking forward to 2012 because we anticipated growth between 3% to 8% to 2011. Chinese government is expected to enforce some stricter engine requirements in the second half so this is going to cause onto some positive momentum here in this market. 
Next segment, beverage can and packaging. Global demand would stay at the 2011 growth levels so we expect a 2% to 3% increase worldwide. Commercial building and construction, the next segment here, the picture has really not changed much. The markets in Europe and North America are further in decline, we believe 3% to 5% in 2012. China is anticipated to grow 8% to 9% growth in the retail sector and the Tier 2 cities through the increase in the demand is most strong driver here. 
And the last segment here, industrial gas turbines, we believe the market has seen a very steep decline in 2009, and slowly in recovery, we expect build rates increase by 5% to 10%. However, and that's very important to us, as a plate manufacturer, we expect the reduction in spare parts so the market, we believe, is going to be flat overall in 2012. 
So what does that all mean if you add it all up and bring it together for the aluminum demand picture? And let's go to the next slide. So we've seen a 10% growth last year, just to show that to you and we believe the growth rate for this year is going to be 7%. So this shows you a breakdown of the different regions, and you do see there a strong growth coming from China. We believe China is going to have about 12% growth obviously on a higher basis. By the way, last year, 15%, Asia 9%; without China, Asia 9%; India, 10%, these are the strong growth drivers. And then we see on the contrast Europe with no growth but also no decline as we believe. 
So let's move to some more details here, the regional premiums and the inventory situation. On the left-hand side, you see the regional premiums broken down in the different regions here. Metal premiums have declined a little but if you compare that to the historic levels, they are still well above historic levels, and this continues to be a good reflection of the physical demand. Physical demand continues to be strong. 
If you move to the right-hand side here, you do see it the inventory levels to be broken down into different types of inventory. This has increased compared to the third quarter. The inventory levels have increased by 4 days from 53 to 57 days of consumption. And part of the increase is obviously driven by the slowdown of demand, and part of it is by metal moving from off-warrant, to on-warrant, and let's take a more detailed look at that. 
On the left-hand side here on this chart, we try to generate an overview of the total global inventory. What you saw before our net slide, the visible part, as well as now an estimate of the invisible inventory, we believe that if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter that we've seen a slight increase of about 400,000 tons here on the inventory side. So some chunk, about 200,000 tons, comes from the slowing in demand so the producers are selling into the LME or is increasing, as you can see here, their own inventory. 
The second chunk is China. China's increasing by about 100,000 tons. This is pretty much almost exclusively the Shanghai Metal Exchange year end liquidation adjustment. And then last but not least, you see about 200,000 tons moving from off-warrant to on-warrant. And to see that phenomenon a little bit more clearly, we've generated that outlook on China on the right-hand side but it's actually pretty simple. If you look at the blue curve, the blue curve shows you the 3-month spread, and you do see what happened in the last year, the contango narrowed. And what happens when the contango narrows and you're about to renew your metal contract and you are off-warrant, and you want to come on-warrant to just be more liquid so that's exactly what happened. 
But we've also seen that the contango going into the end of the year widened again, and that's why we also put the right -- the red curve in here too. And the red curve shows the canceled warrants. So you can see the canceled warrants shoots up immediately after the contango widens, and that basically is a good indicator. The warrants get canceled so going forward, you should see the trends from off-warrant to on-warrant pretty soon getting reversed. 
So let's move now to the supply-demand picture. That's what we see, and that's obviously a very, very important picture, and we haven't generated that as you well know lightheartedly. We are projecting an overall deficit for the Primary Metal in 2012. We believe China will curtail about 1.1 million tons, and I'll elaborate on that. And we could see curtailment in the west of around 700,000 tons so I'll give you some more color on that. 
But before we do that, let's talk about the right-hand side. Not as exciting as the left-hand side but Alumina markets, we believe, will continue to be in balance as we've seen that in 2011 also. 
So let's take a more detailed look on China aluminum situation. So what we see here on the left-hand side, we have done a very thorough analysis and looked to all the smelters that we see in China and made a calculation of where we believe they are standing. With the current Shanghai Metal Exchange pricing, as well as the substantial increase in power costs. We believe that about 1/3 of the total production in China is cash negative. This is a calculation on a cash basis so it's cash negative so it's bleeding leading money. And we're talking about 5.7 million tons. 
On the right-hand side here, you see a breakdown into which provinces are affected by that. So if I remind you on the previous slide, our assumption for the 600,000 deficit ton deficit in the primary market, our assumption is that 1.1 million of this 5.7 million unprofitable leading cash capacity, which basically is 20% of that, will be taken off-line in China. 
So if you believe that, that estimate is a little bit too conservative, obviously, everything else will add to the deficit. As a reference point, I'd like to give you the 2008, 2009 reference, which was the time when China took about 3.5 million tons up from the match right? So too much about the demand-supply situation. Let's also briefly talk about the aluminous attractiveness as an asset class. 
Alumina continues to be attractive as an active class, and we've taken here a look on the Dow UBS Commodity Index, which has about $90 billion under management. So let's take a look at the left-hand side here and look at the stacked bars here. The base metal in that fund makes up or made up in 2011 17.8% of the total composition of this fund. And it's expected, with the rebalancing that is happening, that this will go up to 18.6%. 
So on the right-hand side, you can see here the composition inside of the base metals. And interestingly enough, I mean, aluminum is the second most important asset inside of the base metal after copper was a percentage share of 29% in there. The expectation is after the rebalancing for this to go up to 31.7%. So if you multiply that out, $90 billion roughly of assets under management, and again this is just one of the funds, we're talking about $5.3 billion basically in aluminum so let's fund the loan and a delta of roughly $600 million coming in addition after the rebalancing. So this is obviously good news and another indicator that aluminum continues to be an attractive asset class. 
So if you want to put all these things together and the reason why we've been putting these charts together is to give you a feel for where could pricing end up. And obviously, when you want to make this calculation, you would be looking at where is physical demand supply? We've talked about that, that's a deficit, right? What's the asset attractiveness? This is what you can see here on this. 
And the last remaining piece of information is all of the speculative investment that obviously goes on in all of the commodity sectors. And a lot of that is based on the macroeconomic. Last time, we talked a little bit about the pretty massive amount of shortening that's going on in there. And again, most of it is based on the macroeconomic indicators. So that's why we put this chart here together. 
And if you focus your view first on the lower right-hand corner in here, which shows the prices of different metals, you can see that the second half was not a good second half for a lot of the base metals here. 
But let's also take a look at the kind of indicators that have been drawing on that. The upper left-hand side is the Eurozone prices and a good indicator for the Eurozone prices is as we believe the 5-year bond yields. And as you can see, I mean, the 5-year bond yields had been going up in those critical countries massively in the last year, and that triggered a lot of off-shorting. 
But what you have been seeing over the course of the end of the year, this has been coming down. And if you look at the last weeks, it's been coming down pretty substantially. So it seems that some of the actions that have been taken and are continue to be taken in Europe seems to have led to a more positive view on that. 
You can also take a look here on the upper right-hand side, the consumer confidence. Consumer confidence massively weakened in 2011. But if you look at the U.S. for instance here, it's been substantially down onto a basically August last year and since then, it's been rebounding in a nice, nice fashion. 
And last but not least, a very good indicator, a very good early indicator is the manufacturing purchasing managers index, which you see on the left lower side for the 3 regions. And after a strong decline in 2011, you see that all indices are improving. U.S. and China is already a positive. Actually, U.S. never left, and China just dipped in a little bit and come up of it right away. Europe is still below it but it looks as though the decline has been stopped. 
So let's summarize what we believe we are seeing here on the general market side in our market. 7% global growth in aluminum, we believe, for 2012. For the primary aluminum balance moves to a deficit, we talked about that. That's a class of aluminum continues to be attractive in the macroeconomic indicators, I would say, are showing some first positive signals. 
So what is our approach in this still very volatile market? We will maximize our optionality and increase our speed of execution. Chuck already talked to this slide. I just want to use it to reemphasize that. We basically have a new cash sustainability program for 2012. We're in the middle of executing this, and we will obviously do that very fast. It has these elements of capacity optimization, liquidity initiatives, working capital improvement, costs and productivity gains but we will not let our eye off our True North, which are these 3 strategic priorities, profitable growth and discipline and execution. 
So let me just very briefly because I know that there's a lot of question on, and maybe I can answer this question right away before even the Q&A session, talk about the curtailment here and remind you that what -- why have we done that? We've done that basically for 2 reasons. One is to improve our competitiveness so this is a strategic element. The second one is adjusting flexibility to the current market conditions. 
And also, may I remind you that on the left-hand side, this chart you've seen in 2008, 2009. This is our approach that we developed at that time to have multiple options, how do we go through curtailment steps? And it's well-tested and we know how to do it fast and we know how to do it with a keen eye on cash. It has those elements. It goes -- I mean, the maximum with the permanent shutdown which we've just announced for tenancy and for 2 lines in Rockdale 291,000 tons, full plan curtailment which we are planning to curtailments which are planning to do for La Coruña and Aviles and then there's other elements of realigning. 
So all of these decisions are never easy, and we are working very, very hard to find solutions that minimize the impact on the communities, as well as on our employees that are affected by it. 
So last but not least, our cash sustainability program 2012 has operational as well as financial goals. Here are the operational and the financial goals, goals from capacity optimization, productivity gains of $800 million overhead, continued improvement working capital, another 1.5 days to the financial targets which you see here on the right-hand side. So this gives us all a good idea on how we see 2012 and what we're planning to do. So let me close with that and open it up for Q&A."

And that includes projects like relocating the Australian crusher at our mining site, which is a significant project which has to be done. And the overhaul of the wharf. So those are big sustaining projects that are included in the $725 million that we've got as a target. With regards to the growth CapEx, you can see the biggest change between 2011, which was pretty low growth CapEx numbers, 2012 with $625 million is the Davenport expansion, which is a couple of hundred million dollars in 2012. And then we've got this Saudi Arabia at $350 million. So as we look forward to the year and go through our assumptions around pricing, raw material costs, these spend categories and the $650 million in pension, that's where we get to the point that we think we're going to be able to do that and be cash flow positive. Now are things going to happen during the course of the year, positive, negative going to offset that but we're approaching it from the standpoint that we want to be neutral, no worse than neutral, free cash flow positive so that we're masters of our own destiny, so to speak, regardless of the situation, just like the actions we took on curtailments."

As we start to review the financials, we've got several objectives we'd like to accomplish. The first of all is the clear understanding of our recent actions, along with the associated charges; next to provide you with some insight on our operational cash performance in the quarter; and lastly, to provide commentary on our 2012 cash sustainability targets. 
With that being said, let's turn to the fourth quarter. Our loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $193 million or $0.18 per share. Restructuring and other special items totaled a negative $159 million, which brings us to a loss of $0.03 per share. In just a second, I'll detail the restructuring special items for you. 
A 13% drop in the LME, combined with continued European weakness, contributed to the decrease in revenues on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 6% despite an 11% drop in LME as the aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets all showed greater than 20% increases in revenue. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $656 million, bringing the cash generated this year to $906 million. We achieved the lowest days working capital in our history at 27 days, or 3 days lower than our previous record set in 2010, roughly equivalent to $200 million in cash. Remember, this is on top of the 13-day improvement achieved in the previous 2 years. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio stood at 35%,  or flat with the fourth quarter of 2010, despite a one percentage point increase related to pension plan discount rates. During the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $547 million, and liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.9 billion. Lastly, we achieved all of our 2011 cash sustainability targets, as we continue to improve liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet. 
Now let's move to the income statement. The loss for the quarter of $0.18 per share was primarily driven by restructuring and other charges which I will detail in the next slide. The COGS and SG&A percent of sales increases were essentially driven by decline in revenue, which was a function of the falling metal prices. Our factored tax rate in the quarter was 31% or 36% excluding discrete items. This brings our year-to-date operational tax rate to 24%. With increasing uncertainty across our markets, we will continue to experience swings in the rate as profit drivers with each taxing jurisdiction remain volatile. With 2012, we expect our ETR run rate to be approximately 27%. 
Let's now move on to a review of the special items in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and special items in the fourth quarter totaled an unfavorable $159 million. As announced last week, we've taken decisive actions to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons of smelting capacity. These closures and curtailments represent $141 million of the total restructuring charges. The remaining restructuring relates to headcount reductions in other businesses and an asset write-off in Australia. 
The other special items in the quarter were favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on energy contracts and a gain on the sale of land in Australia. These 2 were completely offset by discrete tax items associated with legislative actions in various jurisdictions and uninsured losses primarily due to flooding at our Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania facility. 
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. The negative net impact of LME and currency for the quarter was $125 million, driven primarily by a sequential drop in metal prices of 13%. Ongoing productivity improvements across our businesses were insufficient to overcome slowing market conditions and prevailing cost headwinds. However, we were able to maintain our rate of productivity improvements on a sequential basis and captured $221 million of improved productivity compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
To get a clearer understanding of these significant movements, let's move on to the segment bridges, and we'll start off with Alumina. While our Alumina business is experiencing significant pressure due to falling market prices, our performance actions have more than offset raw material and cost increases. Alumina production increased this quarter by 1% sequentially, achieving a new quarterly production record driven by Point Comfort in Australia. Market effects for the quarter were almost entirely driven by changes in LME, and they lowered profitability by $94 million. Higher index pricing and our focus on productivity drove a $53 million increase in performance. 
Energy moderated for us during the quarter, while costs have continued to have an increased impact on our cost due to its 3- to 6-month lag. We are beginning to see a softening in certain regions in the caustic market, and as a result, expect to see lower prices, which will begin to improve results by the second quarter. 
Lastly for the fourth quarter, we sold a plot of land in Australia, which contributed $30 million. Looking to the first quarter, we anticipate 33% of our third-party shipments will be on spot or Alumina index basis. The first quarter is also when we undergo significant maintenance in our Australian operations, which will impact the segment results by $20 million. Raw material inflation will continue in the first quarter, and as you have come to expect, we will fight for every productivity dollar available. 
Let's now move to the Primary segment. In Primary Metals, we continued to experience significant headwinds in our business. Production was flat, third-party shipments were up 7% sequentially, and realized pricing was down 12%. Effects of regional premiums on the quarter were muted as the mix of our product sales improved from Q3. However, as we look towards next quarter, this will have an increase impact in our realized price. We were able to generate $21 million in performance improvements this quarter to partially mitigate the higher costs. Energy and raw materials reduced profitability $36 million as we experience the planned outage at our Rockdale energy facility, and we continue to see the impact of rising carbon and alumina prices. 
We managed our working capital to a record level. We dropped 7 days from last quarter and 4 days from the year-ago quarter. As we look to Q1, we will see the full impact of falling regional premiums, as well as a number of seasonal effects on our energy cost. In raw material prices, we are seeing important signs of improvements in the market. Our announced curtailments, as well as a number of other global reductions in supply, had taken regional supply demand balance for calcite and coke from short to long. While we do not expect to see a strong impact in the first quarter due to inventory flows, we do believe this will provide relief in the following quarter. 
Now let's move to Global Roll Products. The story for Global Roll Products this quarter was volume. Seasonal beverage can volume declined as expected in North America and Russia, with volumes down 12% and 23%, respectively. European demand also continued to remain weak in the fourth quarter, with a 16% drop from Q3. Aerospace and automotive demand remained stable. This segment was also negatively impacted by customer credit losses. We continue to drive productivity improvements across the business, and in spite of the lower volumes, generated $4 million in savings. This segment had a record quarter in free cash flow while continuing to invest in growth projects, and they were able to reduce their working capital an astounding 10 days sequentially. 
Solid progress was made towards our 2013 $2.5 billion incremental revenue target. In fact, we've already achieved 55% of our targeted increase in 2011. Next quarter, we expect to see continued demand strengthen in aerospace and automotive and seasonal increases in packaging. Our outlook in Europe remains soft. 
Now let's turn to Engineered Products and Solutions. While down sequentially, Engineered Products and Solutions delivered another solid quarter. Revenue was slightly down quarter-over-quarter and improved by $140 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Profitability declined sequentially but increased by $9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our year-over-year improvement has been driven by management actions to improve our portfolio and better leverage the strength of our innovative products. Productivity improvements was slightly offset by cost increases during the quarter, driven by our Cleveland press outage and lower yield in certain businesses. We remain on target towards a 2013 incremental revenue target of $1.6 billion. We achieved 48% of the increase in 2011. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate incremental improvements in all of our markets, with the exception of commercial transportation in Europe and building and construction in Europe and North America. We also anticipate better quarter-over-quarter productivity gains. 
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. We ended the fourth quarter with exceptional cash results. We generated cash from operations of $1.1 billion, more than $650 million improvement over last quarter. This improvement was driven by significant reductions in working capital. We currently stand at 27 days, which is 11 days lower on a sequential basis and 3 days lower than last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $656 million, bringing the full year to $906 million. Our debt-to-capital increased to 35%, primarily due to lower discount rates that impacted the re-measurement of our pension plan obligations. With $1.9 billion cash on hand, we move forward into 2002 (sic) [2012] with a strong liquidity position. Now if we could, let's take a step back, take a look at our businesses on a full year basis.
On a quarterly basis, each of our businesses face challenges ranging from lower realized prices to market weakness and rising cost. However, when you examine the full year results, it shows strong performance and in most cases exceeded prior year results. Alumina not only finished the year with higher EBITDA per ton, but also exceeded the historical average of $66 per ton. The move to alumina index pricing for approximately 20% of third-party shipments helped the business achieve year-over-year improvements in the face of difficult market conditions. 
In Primary Metals, EBITDA per metric ton was lower than prior year as the segment faced cost headwinds and significantly declining prices in the second half. We've reacted to this situation by aggressively acting to shutter uncompetitive plants permanently, and to curtail locations with higher power. 
The Global Rolled Products business faced challenges in the second half of 2011 due to demand destruction from market weakness in Europe and expected fourth quarter seasonal declines. However, year-over-year performance has improved on an EBITDA per metric ton basis, exceeding both prior year as well as both historical average. It's also important to note that Global Rolled Products achieved 55% of the 2013 revenue growth target in year one. 
Engineered Products and Solutions finished the year with an 18% EBITDA margins, our best performance ever. Like Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products also made great strides against their 2013 target, achieving 48% in the first year. Overall, a challenging second half driven by declining prices and rising costs but our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth and managing cash. 
Now let's turn to the year-over-year bridge. Total cost increases of $1 billion created significant headwinds to our operations. While there was raw material inflation, ramp-up issues, pottery linings or maintenance overhaul, we battled the entire year to offset these increases. We did so through actions designed to increase market share, improve pricing as well as our mix of products and generate ideas in our operations which led to significant productivity improvements. These actions essentially overcame the higher cost and allowed the net benefit of higher prices and currency to hit the bottom line. 
Now let's move on to the full year cash flow. 2011 was another solid year in terms of generating cash and improving liquidity. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion, which included $336 million in pension contributions. Capital expenditures for the year were roughly $1.3 billion or $213 million below our target. After generating $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2010, we generated another $906 million in 2011. The formula for success continues to be solid operating performance and disciplined capital management. 
Underpinning the operating performance is the exceptional performance in working capital, which is demonstrated on the next slide. We continue to make tremendous progress in achieving sustained improvement in our days working capital. In 2011, we established a new record, 27 days. We've been able to reduce days working capital by 16 days, an equivalent of $1.1 billion since 2008 and 3 days since 2010. That one-year improvement equates to roughly $200 million in cash. 
These results demonstrated not only an improvement but a sustainable reduction. Stable operating practices and a relentless focus on cash has been the hallmark of our businesses. As you will see from our 2012 targets, we're going to continue this effort. 
Now let's move on to a report on our 2011 financial targets. For the third consecutive year, we've achieved all of our cash sustainability targets. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital spending, which is demonstrated by our results in both sustaining and growth CapEx. Our investment in the Ma’aden Alcoa joint venture also came in below target at $249 million. Construction is progressing as planned and continues to be on schedule and on budget. Debt-to-capital remains at our targeted range, and we achieved our goal of being free cash flow positive, ending the year with $906 million. These results have us starting 2012 in an improved liquidity position, as shown on the next slide. 
As you can see, our performance has improved markedly from the end of 2008 time period. First, we have significantly improved our free cash flow generation and had been free cash flow positive for the last 2 years. We've been disciplined in our capital spending while still investing in growth opportunities. We have been able to significantly improve our liquidity by maintaining significant cash on hand. At the same time, we have reduced our debt position by more than $1.2 billion and our net debt position by $2.4 billion. We've also reduced our debt-to-capital by more than 700 basis points. 
One area that has generated increased concern has been the funding of our pension plan. With that in mind, let's take a look at the next slide and we'll discuss that topic. Despite a challenging investment environment, Alcoa increased the market value of its assets with an estimated 9% return in 2011. And our pension contributions continued to meet their RESA 80% threshold for funding requirements. We have historically used cash to fund pension obligations, with the exception being 2010 and 2011. Even in this timeframe, we contributed $449 million in cash. We're anticipating the use of cash to fund 2012 requirements. Should  economic conditions change, we will obviously reassess our options. 
Let's now move on to our 2012 view and cash sustainability targets. In the second half of 2011, we faced headwinds influenced by the volatile economic environment. As a result, we entered 2012 managing for cash. I've just elaborated on where we stand from a liquidity position. Yet our goal as we entered 2012 is to utilize these categories of capacity optimization, the cost and productivity gains, working capital and liquidity initiatives to enable us to finish the year cash flow positive. We set our targets to accomplish this overarching objective, which are listed on the next page. 
Alcoa will focus on maximizing cash in 2012, and the following targets had been established as part of our new cash sustainability program. We've already discussed the capacity optimization targets and announced we will close or curtail roughly 12% of Alcoa's global smelting capacity. We have a target to capture productivity gains of $800 million and overhead savings of $50 million in 2012. Even though we set a record on days working capital, we set a goal to achieve another 1.5-day reduction over 2011. 
Alcoa will target positive free cash flow in 2012 and follow a disciplined approach to capital spending, with specific targets established for sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx and spend on the Ma’aden Alcoa JV investment. Lastly is our debt-to-capital target. We will continue to manage our capital structure and maintain a ratio in the range of 30% to 35%. 
Ever since the downturn of '08 and '09, we have taken a very disciplined and aggressive approach in managing for cash. As we enter 2012, we are positioned and committed to meeting the challenge of this current environment. With that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Klaus."

Let's go to the market, and then the Alcoa performance, and then we go into 2012. So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong",4211,"Well, thank you, Chuck. So let's start with a short review of 2011. Let's go to the market, and then the Alcoa performance, and then we go into 2012. 
So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong into the year and weakened in the second half. As you may remember, we projected originally 12% growth. We believe the market has finished with a growth rate of 10% in the last year so that's where it leaves us. 
Let's go to the supply demand picture for 2011 and also close that. So on the left-hand side, you see the primary aluminum side. The market has ended with a slight surplus of 150,000 tons, and the Alumina market, as we projected, is in balance, supply demand situation. 
So let's move on to the 2011 Alcoa performance. And can we have the next chart, please? As you see there, the 4 major segments, right, you see on the Alumina side, the EBITDA per metric ton finished 2011 stronger than 2010, with $70 as slightly above the historic average of $66. Various sectors have contributed to the aluminum pricing index, introducing a market pricing system certainly one of those and our strategic investments helped to improve our business despite very difficult market conditions. On the primary metal side the lower left corner here, the EBITDA per metric ton lower than the prior year basically due to cost headwinds and a substantial price decline in the second half of the year, it basically underlines the importance of our strategic targets as those that follow us for a longer time. Remember last year, we've put out a 10% improvement -- 10 percentage point improvement on the cost curve target in the next 5 years for our primary business, and this is well underway. And as it shows here, it's really important. 
The recent curtailment actions also clearly show our commitment to this, and we have also learned a lot to respond quickly and cashed sensitively in the changing market conditions. This is an important skill that we've acquired in the 2008, 2009 timeframe, particularly in today's very volatile time. 
If you look at the Flat Rolled upper right-hand corner, we face challenges from the second half of the year, with the demand destruction in Europe. However, as you look at the annual performance, it has improved compared to the last year with the EBITDA per metric ton and it's above historic levels. So in addition, what you can see here on this slide what I'll tell you is Flat-Rolled Products also have a strategic target to grow $2.5 billion until 2013, and it's achieved 50% of that in the first year. 
Engineered Products and Solutions business improved margins here, reached 18% EBITDA margin for the full year. This is our best ever performance. This also showed great performance on the growth side. There is a strategic target to grow $1.6 billion in the 3 years after 2013, and they've achieved 48% of that in the first year. So if you look at this chart alone, which tells a good story of what has happened in 2011, so the business have remained very focused on profitable growth, and like in the last downturn, they do not let their eye off the strategic directions. 
And let me just quickly give you some views on what has happened on the strategic side there, starting with Primary. Our new bauxite mine in Juruti, Brazil improved production by more than 50%. At the same time cash came down by 30%. The refinery São Luis is now at nameplate capacity with 3.5 million tons. Our [indiscernible] also in Brazil for the contractual build, 4 of 8 turbines are in place, will be completed this year and it will give us 277 megawatts in this year, it will bring our cost down on the cost curve for the worldwide system by one percentage point. This action alone, that's a good thing in our Saudi Arabia joint venture. Here are some recent pictures. It's the lowest cost as you may remember, and as you can see here, it's nicely coming out of the ground, it's on-time, it's on budget and that's an important thing to see and very important for our strategic direction. 
GRP on the Global Rolled Products side, also been focusing nicely on our growth regions and nicely on some of the growth segments. Russia, as I want to highlight their 20% -- 23% year-on-year volume growth. It's when you look at -- when you look at 2008 to today, $150 million turnaround in profits. When you look at China also, capacity utilization coming up 70%. We expect by 2012, we are a good player in some of the key markets, already in breeding sheets and we are going into other growing markets like consumer electronics. That's a good thing. And then talking about Davenport. Davenport is strongly profiting and looking forward to the growth in automotive, as well as the sustained growth and increased growth in aerospace. Last year, we announced a $300 million investment there to meet the U.S. oil demand. And on aerospace, we'd see clearly a growing capacity with higher ASP [ph] build rate, and this very fundamental decision that was made in 2011 by Airbus to have the A320neo and by Boeing to have the 737 MACs as an all-aluminum plane. That's very, very important, right. 
So last but not least, and when you see the strategic things on EPS. We continue to drive innovation and acquisitions as the major driver for our downstream profitable growth. On the innovation side, I really almost don't know where to start. We are #1 in fasteners. 90% of the fasteners are specialty fastener, 55% are patented. We're #1 in blades going into jet engines and gas turbine. We have a great innovative capability let's just mention the 3D multi-wall airfoil cooling. And what is lead do it, it allows for higher firing temperatures in the chambers, and that basically means it increases the engine efficiency and brings the emission down at the same time. 
We're usually #1 in wheels. And just to give you an impression here, I mean, if you replace the aluminum wheels, the steel wheels with aluminum wheels here in this example, this alone can lead to a 3% to 4% -- 5% fuel saving on a truck and trailer combination. EcoClean has made headlines actually but just very positively mentioned as one of the biggest innovations happening last year. It's an active façade. And if you have 10,000 square feet of EcoClean, it's the equivalent of the pollution reduction that you get from 80 trees per day. 
And in addition to that, we have the bolt-on acquisitions on the fasteners side from [indiscernible]. We expanded our footprint, 4% EBITDA margin improvement -- percentage points, and 4% to 7% market share gains depending on where you go. Trico, the acquisition and the windows side increased our North American commercial window share by 18%. 
So that's that on the operational side. If you look here at the financial targets, and I don't want to go through all of them, we basically achieved all of them, achieved or overachieved all of them together with on the right-hand side, the strategic targets. And that will continue. We're going strong into 2012, and we're well trained and capable to act fast and face up the challenging market conditions. 
So let's go into 2012 and the outlook. Again, we'd start with the end market perspective then we go to aluminum and Alumina and then we talk about the Alcoa action. 
So let's go into the end markets that we cater to. So we actually see on the global scale growth to be positive in 2012 in those end markets that we serve, and at the same time, there are still some specific headwinds in certain regions that will prevail. So let's go through it in the usual way. 
Aerospace for 2012, we believe the positive momentum is going to continue. We expect 10% to 11% growth, driven strongly by large commercial aircraft. We now have an increased confidence in the delivery rates because 2011 net orders came out to be 2,183 of our large commercial aircraft. That's obviously Boeing and Airbus together, which is the second highest in aviation history. The combined backlog of both firms now is 8.2 years. So I think there is good reason to be optimistic about that market. 
Automotive, another pretty good story, with the exception of Western Europe. We expect on a global basis to have growth between 3% to 8% so let's look in some of the major regions. North America. It looked in the summer as though we would see a slowdown but then the fourth quarter came on strong with 13.4 million vehicles. We expect this momentum to continue into 2012 and driven very strongly by the average vehicle age. That's currently at 10.6 years whereas the 10-year average is 9.4 years, so we anticipated growth here between 5% to 10% in 2012. 
One interesting aspect and I want to mention specific to our industry is that we've been seeing that the aspect of fuel efficiency plays a much, much more important role today on the consumer choice but it's different from what it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the consumer really only had a choice to scale down both for a vehicle in a lower class, but today, you have fuel-efficient choices in each segment. Light weighting obviously with aluminum plays an important role here, as it shaves off 10% of fuel efficiency. So this different -- this changed consumer preference together with the strong fuel efficiency legislation drives the company -- the automotive companies into that type of direction. 
Automotive Europe. Sales in the European market, EU27 was down 2% in 2011, driven by positive momentum in Germany plus 9 Eastern Europe, plus 27, but all of that compensated or overcompensated by the reduction in most other countries, France, Italy, Spain, U.K. altogether comes to a down with a combined 7% of these countries, driven by -- given the strength in exports, the production is expected to be plus 5% in 2011, with a substantially weaker second half. And we expect for 2012 and overall production to be around 0% to minus 5%. 
On China automotive, we expect to have -- we except the China have achieved a gain of around 3% in 2011, impacted by the elimination of government stimulus, as well as new vehicle registration limits in some major cities. In 2012, we expect growth to be between 3% to 8%. 
On the heavy trucks and trailer, the next segment in commercial transportation, we expect mixed results. In total, we believe growth between 2% to 5%, driven very much by North America and China. North America commercial trucks and trailer, we do see a total 305,000 units for 2011 so that's up 69% compared to the year before. Production has increased by 64%. We're still positive for this sector. However, we agree with the industry consensus for 2012 of a growth between 2% and 7%. 
Europe commercial transportation 2011 has brought roughly 28% growth. The second half was weak. Actually, a production decline of 19%. We've seen the austerity measures as well as the overall economic issues on the Eurozone are impacting this market obviously. We anticipate a production decline between 8% to 13% in 2012. 
In China, the Chinese commercial truck market has substantially come down from this enormous high of 1 million vehicles in 2010, 865,000 trucks in 2011. We're looking forward to 2012 because we anticipated growth between 3% to 8% to 2011. Chinese government is expected to enforce some stricter engine requirements in the second half so this is going to cause onto some positive momentum here in this market. 
Next segment, beverage can and packaging. Global demand would stay at the 2011 growth levels so we expect a 2% to 3% increase worldwide. Commercial building and construction, the next segment here, the picture has really not changed much. The markets in Europe and North America are further in decline, we believe 3% to 5% in 2012. China is anticipated to grow 8% to 9% growth in the retail sector and Tier 2 cities through the increase in the demand is the most strong driver here. 
And last segment here, industrial gas turbines, we believe the market has seen a very steep decline in 2009, and slowly in recovery, we expect build rates to increase by 5% to 10%. However, and that's very important to us, as a plate manufacturer, we expect the reduction in spare parts so the market, we believe, is going to be flat overall in 2012. 
So what does that all mean if you add it all up and bring it together for the aluminum demand picture? And let's go to the next slide. So we've seen a 10% growth last year, just to show that to you and we believe the growth rate for this year is going to be 7%. So this shows you a breakdown of the different regions, and you do see there a strong growth coming from China. We believe China is going to have about 12% growth obviously on a higher basis. By the way, last year, 15%, Asia 9%; without China, Asia 9%; India, 10%, these are the strong growth drivers. And then we see on the contrast Europe with no growth but also no decline as we believe. 
So let's move to some more details here, the regional premiums and the inventory situation. On the left-hand side, you see the regional premiums broken down in the different regions here. Metal premiums have declined a little but if you compare that to the historic levels, they are still well above historic levels, and this continues to be a good reflection of the physical demand. Physical demand continues to be strong. 
If you move to the right-hand side here, you do see the inventory levels to be broken down into different types of inventory. This has increased compared to the third quarter. The inventory levels have increased by 4 days from 53 to 57 days of consumption. And part of the increase is obviously driven by the slowdown of demand, and part of it is by metal moving from off-warrant, to on-warrant, and let's take a more detailed look at that. 
On the left-hand side here on this chart, we try to generate an overview of the total global inventory. What you saw before our net slide, the visible part, as well as now an estimate of the invisible inventory, we believe that if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter that we've seen a slight increase of about 400,000 tons here on the inventory side. So some chunk, about 200,000 tons, comes from the slowing in demand so the producers are selling into the LME or increasing, as you can see here, their own inventory. 
The second chunk is China. China's increasing by about 100,000 tons. This is pretty much almost exclusively the Shanghai Metal Exchange year end liquidation adjustment. And then last but not least, you see about 200,000 tons moving from off-warrant to on-warrant. And to see that phenomenon a little bit more clearly, we've generated that outlook on China on the right-hand side but it's actually pretty simple. If you look at the blue curve, the blue curve shows you the 3-month spread, and you do see what happened in the last year, the contango narrowed. And what happens when the contango narrows and you're about to renew your metal contract and you are off-warrant, and you want to come on-warrant to just be more liquid so that's exactly what happened. 
But we've also seen that the contango going into the end of the year widened again, and that's why we also put the right -- the red curve in here too. And the red curve shows the canceled warrants. So you can see the canceled warrants shoots up immediately after the contango widens, and that basically is a good indicator. The warrants get canceled so going forward, you should see the trends from off-warrant to on-warrant pretty soon getting reversed. 
So let's move now to the supply-demand picture. That's what we see, and that's obviously a very, very important picture, and we haven't generated that as you well know lightheartedly. We are projecting an overall deficit for the Primary Metal in 2012. We believe China will curtail about 1.1 million tons, and I'll elaborate on that. And we see curtailment in the west of around 700,000 tons so I'll give you some more color on that. 
But before we do that, let's talk about the right-hand side. Not as exciting as the left-hand side but Alumina markets, we believe, will continue to be in balance as we've seen that in 2011 also. 
So let's take a more detailed look on China aluminum situation. So what we see here on the left-hand side, we have done a very thorough analysis and looked through all the smelters that we see in China and made a calculation of where we believe they are standing. With the current Shanghai Metal Exchange pricing, as well as the substantial increase in power cost. We believe that about 1/3 of the total production in China is cash negative. This is a calculation on a cash basis so it's cash negative so it's bleeding leading money. And we're talking about 5.7 million tons. 
On the right-hand side here, you see a breakdown into which provinces are affected by that. So if I remind you on the previous slide, our assumption for the 600,000 deficit ton deficit in the primary market, our assumption is that 1.1 million of this 5.7 million unprofitable leading cash capacity, which basically is 20% of that, will be taken off-line in China. 
So if you believe that, that estimate is a little bit too conservative, obviously, everything else will add to the deficit. As a reference point, I'd like to give you the 2008, 2009 reference, which was the time when China took about 3.5 million tons up from the match right? 
So much about the demand-supply situation. Let's also briefly talk about Alumina's attractiveness as an asset class. Alumina continues to be attractive as an active class, and we've taken here a look at the Dow UBS Commodity Index, which has about $90 billion under management. So let's take a look at the left-hand side here and look at the stacked bars here. The base metal in that fund makes up or made up in 2011 17.8% of the total composition of this fund. And it's expected, with the rebalancing that is happening, that this will go up to 18.6%. 
So on the right-hand side, you can see here the composition inside of the base metals. And interestingly enough, I mean, aluminum is the second most important asset inside of the base metal after copper was a percentage share of 29% in there. The expectation is after the rebalancing for this to go up to 31.7%. So if you multiply that out, $90 billion roughly of assets under management, and again this is just one of the funds, we're talking about $5.3 billion basically in aluminum to this fund alone and a delta of roughly $600 million coming in addition after the rebalancing. So this is obviously good news and another indicator that aluminum continues to be an attractive asset class. 
So if you want to put all these things together and the reason why we've been putting these charts together is to give you a feel for where could pricing end up. And obviously, when you want to make this calculation, you would be looking at where is physical demand supply? We've talked about that, that's a deficit, right? What's the asset attractiveness? This is what you can see here on this. 
And the last remaining piece of information is all of the speculative investment that obviously goes on in all of the commodity sectors. And a lot of that is based on the macroeconomic. Last time, we talked a little bit about the pretty massive amount of shorting that's going on in there. And again, most of it is based on the macroeconomic indicators. So that's why we put this chart here together. And if you focus your view first on the lower right-hand corner in here, which shows the prices of different metals, you can see that the second half was not a good second half for a lot of the base metals here. 
But let's also take a look at the kind of indicators that have been driving that. The upper left-hand side is the Eurozone prices and a good indicator for the Eurozone prices is as we believe the 5-year bond yields. And as you can see, I mean, the 5-year bond yields had been going up in those critical countries massively in the last year, and that triggered a lot of off-shorting. 
But what you have been seeing over the course of the end of the year, this has been coming down. And if you look at the last weeks, it's been coming down pretty substantially. So it seems that some of the actions that have been taken and are continue to be taken in Europe seems to have led to a more positive view on that. 
You can also take a look here on the upper right-hand side, the consumer confidence. Consumer confidence massively weakened in 2011. But if you look at the U.S. for instance here, it's been substantially down onto a basically August last year and since then, it's been rebounding in a nice, nice fashion. 
And last but not least, a very good indicator, a very good early indicator is the manufacturing purchasing managers index, which you see on the left lower side for the 3 regions. And after a strong decline in 2011, you see that all indices are improving. U.S. and China is already in positive. Actually, U.S. never left, and China just dipped in a little bit and come out of it right away. Europe is still below it but it looks as though the decline has been stopped. 
So let's summarize what we believe we are seeing here on the general market side in our market. 7% global growth in aluminum, we believe, for 2012. For the primary aluminum balance moves to a deficit, we talked about that. The asset class of aluminum continues to be attractive in the macroeconomic indicators, I would say, are showing some first positive signals. 
So what is our approach in this still very volatile market? We will maximize our optionality and increase our speed of execution. Chuck already talked to this slide. I just want to use it to reemphasize that. We basically have a new cash sustainability program for 2012. We're in the middle of executing this, and we will obviously do that very fast. It has this element of capacity optimization, liquidity initiatives, working capital improvement, cost and productivity gains, but we will not let our eye off our True North, which are these 3 strategic priorities, profitable growth, our core advantage, and disciplined execution. 
So let me just, very briefly, because I know that there's a lot of question on it, maybe I can answer this question right away before even the Q&A session, talk about the curtailment here and remind you that what -- why have we done that? We've done that basically for 2 reasons. One is to improve our competitiveness. So this is a strategic element. The second one is adjusting flexibility to the current market conditions. 
And also, may I remind you on the left-hand side, this chart you've seen in 2008, 2009. This is our approach that we developed at that time to have multiple options, how do we go through curtailment steps? And it's well-tested and we know how to do it fast and we know how to do it with a keen eye on cash. It has those elements. It goes -- I mean, the maximum is the permanent shutdown, which we've just announced for tenancy and for 2 lines in Rockdale 291,000 tons, full plan curtailment which we are planning to curtailments which are planning to do for La Coruña and Aviles and then there's other elements of realigning. 
So all of these decisions are never easy, and we are working very, very hard to find solutions that minimize the impact on the communities, as well as on our employees that are affected by it. 
So last but not least, our cash sustainability program 2012 has operational as well as financial goals. Here are the operational and the financial goals, goals from capacity optimization, productivity gains of $800 million overhead, continued improvement working capital, another 1.5 days to the financial targets which you see here on the right-hand side. So this gives us all a good idea on how we see 2012 and what we are planning to do. So let me close with that and open it up for Q&A."

Basically, if you looked at our targets, which we covered, the sustaining CapEx, you can see that it's still running at a very low level as a percent of depreciation. I mean, we had 2 years that is was right at 39% in 2009 and 2010. It popped up to 62% in 2011, and it's going to be back under 60% in 2012. And that includes projects like relocating the Australian crusher at our mining site, which is a significant project which has to be done. And the overhaul of the wharf in Baie-Comeau. So those are big sustaining projects that are included in the $725 million that we've got as a target. With regards to the growth CapEx, you can see the biggest change between 2011, which was pretty low growth CapEx numbers, 2012 with $625 million is the Davenport expansion, which is a couple of hundred million dollars in 2012. And then we've got this Saudi Arabia at $350 million. So as we look forward to the year and go through our assumptions around pricing, raw material cost, these spend categories and the $650 million in pension, that's where we get to the point that we think we're going to be able to do that and be cash flow positive. Now are things going to happen during the course of the year, positive, negative going to offset that but we're approaching it from the standpoint that we want to be neutral, no worse than neutral, free cash flow positive so that we're masters of our own destiny, so to speak, regardless of the situation, just like the actions we took on curtailments."

With the midstream business, to be precise, I mean, you said stalled a couple of quarters. I would say it can be correlated. If you look at the total here, you see on this slide that we showed that the EBITDA per metric ton has continued to go up and it's at a higher level than last year, which is a great achievement. And obviously, it's an achievement of having substantially changed also the mix. We have the intention to continue to do that.

And even as metal price comes up a little bit, that does not mean that immediately, I mean, everything in China is rosy. The Chinese aluminum industry, as we all know, has a structural problem that will not go away and that will lead to some structural consequences, almost independent of whether metal prices because there are some other considerations also coming in, mainly the energy, how to use the energy and in a country that is not energy rich and then the question of sustainability given that almost all refineries and all smelters are using coal fire power, yes.

As we start to review the financials, we've got several objectives we'd like to accomplish. The first of all is the clear understanding of our recent actions, along with the associated charges; next to provide you with some insight on our operational cash performance in the quarter; and lastly, to provide commentary on our 2012 cash sustainability targets. 
With that being said, let's turn to the fourth quarter. Our loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $193 million or $0.18 per share. Restructuring and other special items totaled a negative $159 million, which brings us to a loss of $0.03 per share. In just a second, I'll detail the restructuring special items for you. 
A 13% drop in the LME, combined with continued European weakness, contributed to the decrease in revenues on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 6% despite an 11% drop in LME as the aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets all showed greater than 20% increases in revenue. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $656 million, bringing the cash generated this year to $906 million. We achieved the lowest day’s working capital in our history at 27 days, or 3 days lower than our previous record set in 2010, roughly equivalent to $200 million in cash. Remember, this is on top of the 13-day improvement achieved in the previous 2 years. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio stood at 35%,  or flat with the fourth quarter of 2010, despite a 1 percentage point increase related to pension plan discount rates. During the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $547 million, and liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.9 billion. Lastly, we achieved all of our 2011 cash sustainability targets, as we continue to improve liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet. 
Now let's move to the income statement. The loss for the quarter of $0.18 per share was primarily driven by restructuring and other charges which I will detail in the next slide. The COGS and SG&A percent of sales increases were essentially driven by a decline in revenue, which was a function of the falling metal prices. Our factored tax rate in the quarter was 31% or 36% excluding discrete items. This brings our year-to-date operational tax rate to 24%. With increasing uncertainty across our markets, we will continue to experience swings in the rate as profit drivers with each taxing jurisdiction remain volatile. With 2012, we expect our ETR run rate to be approximately 27%. 
Let's now move on to a review of the special items in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and special items in the fourth quarter totaled an unfavorable $159 million. As announced last week, we've taken decisive action to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons of smelting capacity. These closures and curtailments represent $141 million of the total restructuring charges. The remaining restructuring relates to headcount reductions in other businesses and an asset write-off in Australia. 
The other special items in the quarter were favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on energy contracts and a gain on the sale of land in Australia. These 2 were completely offset by discrete tax items associated with legislative actions in various jurisdictions and uninsured losses primarily due to flooding at our Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania facility. 
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. The negative net impact of LME and currency for the quarter was $125 million, driven primarily by a sequential drop in metal prices of 13%. Ongoing productivity improvements across our businesses were insufficient to overcome slowing market conditions and prevailing cost headwinds. However, we were able to maintain our rate of productivity improvements on a sequential basis and capture $221 million of improved productivity compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
To get a clearer understanding of these significant movements, let's move on to the segment bridges, and we'll start off with Alumina. While our Alumina business is experiencing significant pressure due to falling market prices, our performance actions have more than offset raw material and cost increases. Alumina production increased this quarter by 1% sequentially, achieving a new quarterly production record driven by Point Comfort in Australia. Market effects for the quarter were almost entirely driven by changes in LME, and they lowered profitability by $94 million. Higher index pricing and our focus on productivity drove a $53 million increase in performance. 
Energy moderated for us during the quarter, while costs have continued to have an increased impact on our cost due to its 3- to 6-month lag. We are beginning to see a softening in certain regions in the caustic market, and as a result, expect to see lower prices, which will begin to improve results by the second quarter. 
Lastly for the fourth quarter, we sold a plot of land in Australia, which contributed $30 million. Looking to the first quarter, we anticipate 33% of our third-party shipments will be on spot or Alumina index basis. The first quarter is also when we undergo significant maintenance in our Australian operations, which will impact the segment results by $20 million. Raw material inflation will continue in the first quarter, and as you have come to expect, we will fight for every productivity dollar available. 
Now I'll move to the Primary segment. In Primary Metals, we continued to experience significant headwinds in our business. Production was flat, third-party shipments were up 7% sequentially, and realized pricing was down 12%. Effects of regional premiums on the quarter were muted as the mix of our product sales improved from Q3. However, as we look towards next quarter, this will have an increase impact on our realized price. We were able to generate $21 million in performance improvements this quarter to partially mitigate the higher costs. Energy and raw materials reduced profitability $36 million as we experience the planned outage at our Rockdale energy facility, and we continue to see the impact of rising carbon and alumina prices. 
We managed our working capital to a record level. We dropped 7 days from last quarter and 4 days from the year-ago quarter. As we look at Q1, we will see the full impact of falling regional premiums, as well as a number of seasonal effects on our energy cost. In raw material prices, we are seeing important signs of improvements in the market. Our announced curtailments, as well as a number of other global reductions in supply, had taken regional supply demand balance for calcine and coke from short to long. While we do not expect to see a strong impact in the first quarter due to inventory flows, we do believe this will provide relief in the following quarter. 
Now let's move to Global Rolled Products. The story for Global Rolled Products this quarter was volume. Seasonal beverage can volume declined as expected in North America and Russia, with volumes down 12% and 23%, respectively. European demand also continued to remain weak in the fourth quarter, with a 16% drop from Q3. Aerospace and automotive demand remained stable. This segment was also negatively impacted by customer credit losses. We continue to drive productivity improvements across the business, and in spite of the lower volumes, generated $4 million in savings. This segment had a record quarter in free cash flow while continuing to invest in growth projects, and they were able to reduce their working capital an astounding 10 days sequentially. 
Solid progress was made towards our 2013 $2.5 billion incremental revenue target. In fact, we've already achieved 55% of our targeted increase in 2011. Next quarter, we expect to see continued demand strength in aerospace and automotive and seasonal increases in packaging. Our outlook in Europe remains soft. 
Now let's turn to Engineered Products and Solutions. While down sequentially, Engineered Products and Solutions delivered another solid quarter. Revenue was slightly down quarter-over-quarter and improved by $140 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Profitability declined sequentially but increased by $9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our year-over-year improvement has been driven by management actions to improve our portfolio and better leverage the strength of our innovative products. Productivity improvements was slightly offset by cost increases during the quarter, driven by our Cleveland press outage and lower yield in certain businesses. We remain on target towards a 2013 incremental revenue target of $1.6 billion. We achieved 48% of the increase in 2011. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate incremental improvements in all of our markets, with the exception of commercial transportation in Europe and building and construction in Europe and North America. We also anticipate better quarter-over-quarter productivity gains. 
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. We ended the fourth quarter with exceptional cash results. We generated cash from operations of $1.1 billion, more than $650 million improvement over last quarter. This improvement was driven by significant reductions in working capital. We currently stand at 27 days, which is 11 days lower on a sequential basis and 3 days lower than last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $656 million, bringing the full year to $906 million. Our debt-to-capital increased to 35%, primarily due to lower discount rates that impacted the re-measurement of our pension plan obligations. With $1.9 billion cash on hand, we move forward into 2002 (sic) with a strong liquidity position. Now if we could, let's take a step back, take a look at our businesses on a full year basis.
On a quarterly basis, each of our businesses face challenges ranging from lower realized prices to market weakness and rising cost. However, when you examine the full year results, it shows strong performance and in most cases exceeded prior year results. Alumina not only finished the year with higher EBITDA per ton, but also exceeded the historical average of $66 per ton. The move to alumina index pricing for approximately 20% of third-party shipments helped the business achieve year-over-year improvements in the face of difficult market conditions. 
In Primary Metals, EBITDA per metric ton was lower than prior year as the segment faced cost headwinds and significantly declining prices in the second half. We've reacted to this situation by aggressively acting to shutter uncompetitive plants permanently, and to curtail locations with higher power. 
The Global Rolled Products business faced challenges in the second half of 2011 due to demand destruction from market weakness in Europe and expected fourth quarter seasonal declines. However, year-over-year performance has improved on an EBITDA per metric ton basis, exceeding both prior year as well as above historical average. It's also important to note that Global Rolled Products achieved 55% of the 2013 revenue growth target in year one. 
Engineered Products and Solutions finished the year with an 18% EBITDA margins, our best performance ever. Like Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products also made great strides against their 2013 target, achieving 48% in the first year. Overall, a challenging second half driven by declining prices and rising costs but our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth and managing cash. 
Now let's turn to the year-over-year bridge. Total cost increases of $1 billion created significant headwinds to our operations. While there was raw material inflation, ramp-up issues, pot re-linings or maintenance overhaul, we battled the entire year to offset these increases. We did so through actions designed to increase market share, improve pricing as well as our mix of products and generate ideas in our operations which led to significant productivity improvements. These actions essentially overcame the higher cost and allowed the net benefit of higher prices and currency to hit the bottom line. 
Now let's move on to the full year cash flow. 2011 was another solid year in terms of generating cash and improving liquidity. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion, which included $336 million in pension contributions. Capital expenditures for the year were roughly $1.3 billion or $213 million below our target. After generating $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2010, we generated another $906 million in 2011. The formula for success continues to be solid operating performance and disciplined capital management. 
Underpinning the operating performance is the exceptional performance in working capital, which is demonstrated on the next slide. We continue to make tremendous progress in achieving sustained improvement in our day’s working capital. In 2011, we established a new record, 27 days. We've been able to reduce day’s working capital by 16 days, an equivalent of $1.1 billion since 2008 and 3 days since 2010. That one-year improvement equates to roughly $200 million in cash. 
These results demonstrated not only an improvement but a sustainable reduction. Stable operating practices and a relentless focus on cash has been the hallmark of our businesses. As you will see from our 2012 targets, we're going to continue this effort. 
Now let's move on to a report on our 2011 financial targets. For the third consecutive year, we've achieved all of our cash sustainability targets. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital spending, which is demonstrated by our results in both sustaining and growth CapEx. Our investment in the Ma’aden Alcoa joint venture also came in below target at $249 million. Construction is progressing as planned and continues to be on schedule and on budget. Debt-to-capital remains at our targeted range, and we achieved our goal of being free cash flow positive, ending the year with $906 million. These results have us starting 2012 in an improved liquidity position, as shown on the next slide. 
As you can see, our performance has improved markedly from the end of 2008 time period. First, we have significantly improved our free cash flow generation and had been free cash flow positive for the last 2 years. We've been disciplined in our capital spending while still investing in growth opportunities. We have been able to significantly improve our liquidity by maintaining significant cash on hand. At the same time, we have reduced our debt position by more than $1.2 billion and our net debt position by $2.4 billion. We've also reduced our debt-to-capital by more than 700 basis points. 
One area that has generated increased concern has been the funding of our pension plan. With that in mind, let's take a look at the next slide and we'll discuss that topic. Despite a challenging investment environment, Alcoa increased the market value of its assets with an estimated 9% return in 2011. And our pension contributions continued to meet their RESA 80% threshold for funding requirements. We have historically used cash to fund pension obligations, with the exception being 2010 and 2011. Even in this timeframe, we contributed $449 million in cash. We're anticipating the use of cash to fund 2012 requirements. Should  economic conditions change, we will obviously reassess our options. 
Let's now move on to our 2012 view and cash sustainability targets. In the second half of 2011, we faced headwinds influenced by the volatile economic environment. As a result, we entered 2012 managing for cash. I've just elaborated on where we stand from a liquidity position. Yet our goal as we entered 2012 is to utilize these categories of capacity optimization, the cost and productivity gains, working capital and liquidity initiatives to enable us to finish the year cash flow positive. We set our targets to accomplish this overarching objective, which are listed on the next page. 
Alcoa will focus on maximizing cash in 2012, and the following targets had been established as part of our new cash sustainability program. We've already discussed the capacity optimization targets and announced we will close or curtail roughly 12% of Alcoa's global smelting capacity. We have a target to capture productivity gains of $800 million and overhead savings of $50 million in 2012. Even though we set a record on day’s working capital, we set a goal to achieve another 1.5-day reduction over 2011. 
Alcoa will target positive free cash flow in 2012 and follow a disciplined approach to capital spending, with specific targets established for sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx and spend on the Ma’aden Alcoa JV investment. Lastly is our debt-to-capital target. We will continue to manage our capital structure and maintain a ratio in the range of 30% to 35%. 
Ever since the downturn of '08 and '09, we have taken a very disciplined and aggressive approach in managing for cash. As we enter 2012, we are positioned and committed to meeting the challenge of this current environment. With that, I'd like to turn the floor over to Klaus."
249603,117842988,205912,"Alcoa, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 09, 2012",2012-01-09,"Earnings Calls","Alcoa Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Chuck. So let's start with a short review of 2011. Let's go to the market, and then the Alcoa performance, and then we go into 2012. So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong",4222,"Well, thank you, Chuck. So let's start with a short review of 2011. Let's go to the market, and then the Alcoa performance, and then we go into 2012. 
So let's start with the market. The aluminum demand continued to grow substantially. It started strong into the year and weakened in the second half. As you may remember, we projected originally 12% growth. We believe the market has finished with a growth rate of 10% in the last year so that's where it leaves us. 
Let's go to the supply demand picture for 2011 and also close that. So on the left-hand side, you see the primary aluminum side. The market has ended with a slight surplus of 150,000 tons, and the Alumina market, as we projected, is in balance, supply demand situation. 
So let's move on to the 2011 Alcoa performance. And can we have the next chart, please? As you see there, the 4 major segments, right, you see on the Alumina side, the EBITDA per metric ton finished 2011 stronger than 2010, with $70 as slightly above the historic average of $66. Various sectors have contributed to the aluminum pricing index, introducing a market pricing system, certainly one of those. And our strategic investments helped to improve our business despite very difficult market conditions. On the primary metal side the lower left corner here, the EBITDA per metric ton lower than the prior year basically due to cost headwinds and a substantial price decline in the second half of the year. It basically underlines the importance of our strategic targets as those that follow us for a longer time. Remember last year, we've put out a 10% improvement -- 10 percentage point improvement on the cost curve target in the next 5 years for our primary business, and this is well underway. And as it shows here, it's really important. 
The recent curtailment actions also clearly show our commitment to this, and we have also learned a lot to respond quickly and cashed sensitively in the changing market conditions. This is an important skill that we've acquired in the 2008, 2009 timeframe, particularly in today's very volatile time. 
If you look at the Flat Rolled upper right-hand corner, we face challenges from the second half of the year, with the demand destruction in Europe. However, as you look at the annual performance, it has improved compared to the last year with the EBITDA per metric ton and it's above historic levels. So in addition, what you can see here on this slide what I'll tell you is Flat-Rolled Products also have a strategic target to grow $2.5 billion until 2013, and it's achieved 50% of that in the first year. 
Engineered Products and Solutions business improved margins here, reached 18% EBITDA margin for the full year. This is our best ever performance. This also showed great performance on the growth side. There is a strategic target to grow $1.6 billion in the 3 years until 2013, and they've achieved 48% of that in the first year. So if you look at this chart alone, which tells a good story of what has happened in 2011, so the business have remained very focused on profitable growth, and like in the last downturn, they do not let their eye off the strategic directions. 
And let me just quickly give you some views on what has happened on the strategic side there, starting with Primary. Our new bauxite mine in Juruti, Brazil improved production by more than 50%. At the same time cash came down by 30%. The refinery São Luis is now at nameplate capacity with 3.5 million tons. Our hydro dam trade [ph] also in Brazil for the structural build, 4 of 8 turbines are in place, will be completed this year and it will give us 277 megawatts in this year, it will bring our cost down on the cost curve for the worldwide system by one percentage point. This action alone, that's a good thing in our Saudi Arabia joint venture. Here are some recent pictures. It's the lowest cost as you may remember, and as you can see here, it's nicely coming out of the ground, it's on-time, it's on budget and that's an important thing to see and very important for our strategic direction. 
GRP on the Global Rolled Products side, also been focusing nicely on our growth regions and nicely on some of the growth segments. Russia, as I want to highlight their 20% -- 23% year-on-year volume growth. It's when you look at -- when you look at 2008 to today, $150 million turnaround in profits. When you look at China also, capacity utilization coming up 70%. We expect by 2012, we are a good player in some of the key markets, already in breeding sheets and we are going into other growing markets like consumer electronics. That's a good thing. And then talking about Davenport. Davenport is strongly profiting and looking forward to the growth in automotive, as well as the sustained growth and increased growth in aerospace. Last year, we announced a $300 million investment there to meet the U.S. oil demand. And on aerospace, we'd see clearly a growing capacity with higher ASP [ph] build rate, and this very fundamental decision that was made in 2011 by Airbus to have the A320neo and by Boeing to have the 737 MACs as an all-aluminum plane. That's very, very important, right. 
So last but not least, and when you see the strategic things on EPS. We continue to drive innovation and acquisitions as the major driver for our downstream profitable growth. On the innovation side, I really almost don't know where to start. We are #1 in fasteners. 90% of the fasteners are specialty fastener, 55% are patented. We're #1 in blades going into jet engines and gas turbine. We have a great innovative capability. Let's just mention the 3D multi-wall airfoil cooling. And what is lead do it, it allows for higher firing temperatures in the chambers, and that basically means it increases the engine efficiency and brings the emission down at the same time. 
We're usually #1 in wheels. And just to give you an impression here, I mean, if you replace the aluminum wheels, the steel wheels with aluminum wheels here in this example, this alone can lead to a 3% to 4% -- 5% fuel saving on a truck and trailer combination. EcoClean has made headlines actually but just very positively mentioned as one of the biggest innovations happening last year. It's an active façade. And if you have 10,000 square feet of EcoClean, it's the equivalent of the pollution reduction that you get from 80 trees per day. 
And in addition to that, we have the bolt-on acquisitions on the fasteners side from Perry Republic [ph], TransDigm. We expanded our footprint, 4% EBITDA margin improvement for percentage points, and 4% to 7% market share gains depending on where you go. Trico, the acquisition and the windows side increased our North American commercial window share by 18%. 
So that's that on the operational side. If you look here at the financial targets, and I don't want to go through all of them, we basically achieved all of them, achieved or overachieved all of them together with on the right-hand side, the strategic targets. And that will continue. We're going strong into 2012, and we're well trained and capable to act fast and face up the challenging market conditions. 
So let's go into 2012 and the outlook. Again, we'd start with the end market perspective then we go to aluminum and Alumina and then we talk about the Alcoa action. 
So let's go into the end markets that we cater to. So we actually see on the global scale growth to be positive in 2012 in those end markets that we serve, and at the same time, there are still some specific headwinds in certain regions that will prevail. So let's go through it in the usual way. 
Aerospace for 2012, we believe the positive momentum is going to continue. We expect 10% to 11% growth, driven strongly by large commercial aircraft. We now have an increased confidence in the delivery rates because 2011 net orders came out to be 2,183 of our large commercial aircraft. That's obviously Boeing and Airbus together, which is the second highest in aviation history. The combined backlog of both firms now is 8.2 years. So I think there is good reason to be optimistic about that market. 
Automotive, another pretty good story, with the exception of Western Europe. We expect on a global basis to have growth between 3% to 8%. So let's look in some of the major regions. North America. It looked in the summer as though we would see a slowdown but then the fourth quarter came on strong with 13.4 million vehicles. We expect this momentum to continue into 2012 and driven very strongly by the average vehicle age. That's currently at 10.6 years whereas the 10-year average is 9.4 years, so we anticipated a growth here between 5% to 10% in 2012. 
One interesting aspect and I want to mention specific to our industry is that we've been seeing that the aspect of fuel efficiency plays a much, much more important role today on the consumer choice but it's different from what it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the consumer really only had a choice to scale down both for a vehicle in a lower class, but today, you have fuel-efficient choices in each segment. Light weighting obviously with aluminum plays an important role here, as it shaves off 10% of fuel efficiency. So this different -- this changed consumer preference together with the strong fuel efficiency legislation drives the company -- the automotive companies into that type of direction. 
Automotive Europe. Sales in the European market, EU27 was down 2% in 2011, driven by positive momentum in Germany plus 9 Eastern Europe, plus 27, but all of that compensated or overcompensated by the reduction in most other countries, France, Italy, Spain, U.K. altogether comes to a down with a combined 7% of these countries, driven by -- given the strength in exports, the production is expected to be plus 5% in 2011, with a substantially weaker second half. And we expect for 2012 and overall production to be around 0% to minus 5%. 
On China automotive, we expect to have -- we except the China have achieved a gain of around 3% in 2011, impacted by the elimination of government stimulus, as well as new vehicle registration limits in some major cities. In 2012, we expect growth to be between 3% to 8%. 
On the heavy trucks and trailer, the next segment in commercial transportation, we expect mixed results. In total, we believe growth between 2% to 5%, driven very much by North America and China. North America commercial trucks and trailer, we do see a total 305,000 units for 2011 so that's up 69% compared to the year before. Production has increased by 64%. We're still positive for this sector. However, we agree with the industry consensus for 2012 of a growth between 2% and 7%. 
Europe commercial transportation 2011 has brought roughly 28% growth. The second half was weak. Actually, a production decline of 19%. We've seen the austerity measures as well as the overall economic issues on the Eurozone are impacting this market obviously. We anticipate a production decline between 8% to 13% in 2012. 
In China, the Chinese commercial truck market has substantially come down from this enormous high of 1 million vehicles in 2010, 865,000 trucks in 2011. We're looking forward to 2012 because we anticipated growth between 3% to 8% to 2011. Chinese government is expected to enforce some stricter engine requirements in the second half so this is going to cause onto some positive momentum here in this market. 
Next segment, beverage can and packaging. Global demand would stay at the 2011 growth levels so we expect a 2% to 3% increase worldwide. Commercial building and construction, the next segment here, the picture has really not changed much. The markets in Europe and North America are further in decline, we believe 3% to 5% in 2012. China is anticipated to grow 8% to 9% growth in the retail sector and Tier 2 cities through the increase in the demand is the most strong driver here. 
And last segment here, industrial gas turbines, we believe the market has seen a very steep decline in 2009, and its slowly in recovery, we expect build rates to increase by 5% to 10%. However, and that's very important to us, as a blade manufacturer, we expect the reduction in spare parts so the market, we believe, is going to be flat overall in 2012. 
So what does that all mean if you add it all up and bring it together for the aluminum demand picture? And let's go to the next slide. So we've seen a 10% growth last year, just to show that to you and we believe the growth rate for this year is going to be 7%. So this shows you a breakdown of the different regions, and you do see there a strong growth coming from China. We believe China is going to have about 12% growth obviously on a higher basis. By the way, last year, 15%, Asia 9%; without China, Asia 9%; India, 10%, these are the strong growth drivers. And then we see on the contrast Europe with no growth but also no decline as we believe. 
So let's move to some more details here, the regional premiums and the inventory situation. On the left-hand side, you see the regional premiums broken down in the different regions here. Metal premiums have declined a little but if you compare that to the historic levels, they are still well above historic levels, and this continues to be a good reflection of the physical demand. Physical demand continues to be strong. 
If you move to the right-hand side here, you do see the inventory levels to be broken down into different types of inventory. This has increased compared to the third quarter. The inventory levels have increased by 4 days from 53 to 57 days of consumption. And part of the increase is obviously driven by the slowdown of demand, and part of it is by metal moving from off-warrant, to on-warrant, and let's take a more detailed look at that. 
On the left-hand side here on this chart, we try to generate an overview of the total global inventory. What you saw before our that slide, the visible part, as well as now an estimate of the invisible inventory, we believe that if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter that we've seen a slight increase of about 400,000 tons here on the inventory side. So some chunk, about 200,000 tons, comes from the slowing in demand so the producers are selling into the LME or increasing, as you can see here, their own inventory. 
The second chunk is China. China's increasing by about 100,000 tons. This is pretty much almost exclusively the Shanghai Metal Exchange year end liquidation adjustment. And then last but not least, you see about 200,000 tons moving from off-warrant to on-warrant. And to see that phenomenon a little bit more clearly, we've generated that outlook in China on the right-hand side but it's actually pretty simple. If you look at the blue curve, the blue curve shows you the 3-month spread, and you do see what happened in the last year, the contango narrowed. And what happens when the contango narrows and you're about to renew your metal contract and you are off-warrant, and you want to come on-warrant to just be more liquid so that's exactly what happened. 
But we've also seen that the contango going into the end of the year widened again, and that's why we also put the right -- the red curve in here too. And the red curve shows the canceled warrants. So you can see the canceled warrants shoots up immediately after the contango widens, and that basically is a good indicator. The warrants get canceled so going forward, you should see the trends from off-warrant to on-warrant pretty soon getting reversed. 
So let's move now to the supply-demand picture. That's what we see, and that's obviously a very, very important picture, and we haven't generated that as you well know lightheartedly. We are projecting an overall deficit for the Primary Metal in 2012. We believe China will curtail about 1.1 million tons, and I'll elaborate on that. And we see curtailment in the west of around 700,000 tons so I'll give you some more color on that. 
But before we do that, let's talk about the right-hand side. Not as exciting as the left-hand side but Alumina markets, we believe, will continue to be in balance as we've seen that in 2011 also. 
So let's take a more detailed look on China aluminum situation. So what we see here on the left-hand side, we have done a very thorough analysis and looked through all the smelters that we see in China and made a calculation of where we believe they are standing. With the current Shanghai Metal Exchange pricing, as well as the substantial increase in power cost. We believe that about 1/3 of the total production in China is cash negative. This is a calculation on a cash basis so it's cash negative so it's bleeding leading money. And we're talking about 5.7 million tons. 
On the right-hand side here, you see a breakdown into which provinces are affected by that. So if I remind you on the previous slide, our assumption for the 600,000 deficit -- ton deficit in the primary market, our assumption is that 1.1 million of this 5.7 million unprofitable leading cash capacity, which basically is 20% of that, will be taken off-line in China. 
So if you believe that, that estimate is a little bit too conservative, obviously, everything else will add to the deficit. As a reference point, I'd like to give you the 2008, 2009 reference, which was the time when China took about 3.5 million tons up from the match right? 
So, so much about the demand-supply situation. Let's also briefly talk about Alumina's attractiveness as an asset class. Alumina continues to be attractive as an asset class, and we've taken here a look at the Dow UBS Commodity Index, which has about $90 billion under management. So let's take a look at the left-hand side here and look at the stacked bars here. The base metal in that fund makes up or made up in 2011 17.8% of the total composition of this fund. And it's expected, with the rebalancing that is happening, that this will go up to 18.6%. 
So on the right-hand side, you can see here the composition inside of the base metals. And interestingly enough, I mean, aluminum is the second most important asset inside of the base metal after copper was a percentage share of 29% in there. The expectation is after the rebalancing for this to go up to 31.7%. So if you multiply that out, $90 billion roughly of assets under management, and again this is just one of the funds, we're talking about $5.3 billion basically in aluminum to this fund alone and a delta of roughly $600 million coming in, in addition after the rebalancing. So this is obviously good news and another indicator that aluminum continues to be an attractive asset class. 
So if you want to put all these things together and the reason why we've been putting these charts together is to give you a feel for where could pricing end up. And obviously, when you want to make this calculation, you would be looking at where is physical demand supply? We've talked about that, that's a deficit, right? What's the asset attractiveness? This is what you can see here on this. 
And the last remaining piece of information is all of the speculative investment that obviously goes on in all of the commodity sectors. And a lot of that is based on the macroeconomic. Last time, we talked a little bit about the pretty massive amount of shorting that's going on in there. And again, most of it is based on the macroeconomic indicators. So that's why we put this chart here together. And if you focus your view first on the lower right-hand corner in here, which shows the prices of different metals, you can see that the second half was not a good second half for a lot of the base metals here. 
But let's also take a look at the kind of indicators that have been driving that. The upper left-hand side is the Eurozone prices and a good indicator for the Eurozone prices is as we believe the 5-year bond yields. And as you can see, I mean, the 5-year bond yields had been going up in those critical countries massively in the last year, and that triggered a lot of off-shorting. 
But what you have been seeing over the course of the end of the year, this has been coming down. And if you look at the last weeks, it's been coming down pretty substantially. So it seems that some of the actions that have been taken and are continue to be taken in Europe seems to have led to a more positive view on that. 
You can also take a look here on the upper right-hand side, the consumer confidence. Consumer confidence massively weakened in 2011. But if you look at the U.S. for instance here, it's been substantially down onto a basically August last year and since then, it's been rebounding in a nice, nice fashion. 
And last but not least, a very good indicator, a very good early indicator is the manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which you see on the left lower side for the 3 regions. And after a strong decline in 2011, you see that all indices are improving. U.S. and China is already in positive. Actually, U.S. never left, and China just dipped in a little bit and come out of it right away. Europe is still below it but it looks as though the decline has been stopped. 
So let's summarize what we believe we are seeing here on the general market side in our market. 7% global growth in aluminum, we believe, for 2012. For the primary aluminum balance moves to a deficit, we talked about that. The asset class of aluminum continues to be attractive in the macroeconomic indicators, I would say, are showing some first positive signals. 
So what is our approach in this still very volatile market? We will maximize our optionality and increase our speed of execution. Chuck already talked to this slide. I just want to use it to reemphasize that. We basically have a new cash sustainability program for 2012. We're in the middle of executing this, and we will obviously do that very fast. It has this element of capacity optimization, liquidity initiatives, working capital improvement, cost and productivity gains, but we will not let our eye off our True North, which are these 3 strategic priorities, profitable growth, our core advantage, and disciplined execution. 
So let me just, very briefly, because I know that there's a lot of question on it, maybe I can answer this question right away before even the Q&A session, talk about the curtailment here and remind you that what -- why have we done that? We've done that basically for 2 reasons. One is to improve our competitiveness. So this is a strategic element. The second one is adjusting flexibility to the current market conditions. 
And also, may I remind you on the left-hand side, this chart you've seen in 2008, 2009. This is our approach that we developed at that time to have multiple options, how do we go through curtailment steps? And it's well-tested and we know how to do it fast and we know how to do it with a keen eye on cash. It has those elements. It goes -- I mean, the maximum is the permanent shutdown, which we've just announced for tenancy and for 2 lines in Rockdale 291,000 tons, full plan curtailment which we are planning to curtailments which are planning to do for La Coruña and Aviles and then there's other elements of realigning. 
So all of these decisions are never easy, and we are working very, very hard to find solutions that minimize the impact on the communities, as well as on our employees that are affected by it. 
So last but not least, our cash sustainability program 2012 has operational as well as financial goals. Here are the operational and the financial goals, goals from capacity optimization, productivity gains of $800 million overhead, continued improvement working capital, another 1.5 days to the financial targets which you see here on the right-hand side. So this gives us all a good idea on how we see 2012 and what we are planning to do. So let me close with that and open it up for Q&A."

Basically, if you looked at our targets, which we covered, the sustaining CapEx, you can see that it's still running at a very low level as a percent of depreciation.

And that includes projects like relocating the Australian crusher at our mining site, which is a significant project which has to be done. And the overhaul of the wharf in Baie-Comeau. So those are big sustaining projects that are included in the $725 million that we've got as a target. With regards to the growth CapEx, you can see the biggest change between 2011, which was pretty low growth CapEx numbers, 2012 with $625 million is the Davenport expansion, which is a couple of hundred million dollars in 2012. And then we've got this Saudi Arabia at $350 million. So as we look forward to the year and go through our assumptions around pricing, raw material cost, these spend categories and the $650 million in pension, that's where we get to the point that we think we're going to be able to do that and be cash flow positive. Now are things going to happen during the course of the year, positive and negative will offset that but we're approaching it from the standpoint that we want to be neutral, no worse than neutral, free cash flow positive so that we're masters of our own destiny, so to speak, regardless of the situation, just like the actions we took on curtailments."

So you don't take the 600,000, take the 1.1 million tons that we have put into what leads to the 600,000 of curtailments in China. And as I said, 5.7 million tons in China are underwater, cash-wise. We took 1.1 million and as the estimate of what comes offline, I personally believe that this is a very conservative estimate. And even as metal price comes up a little bit, that does not mean that immediately, I mean, everything in China is rosy. The Chinese aluminum industry, as we all know, has a structural problem that will not go away and that will lead to some structural consequences, almost independent of where metal price is, because there are some other considerations also coming in, mainly the energy, how they use the energy and in a country that is not energy rich and then the question of sustainability given that almost all refineries and all smelters are using coal fire power, yes. To be continued."

Look, before we dive into the slides, I'd just like to make a few introductory comments if I could. I think we started the year with an excellent first quarter, and I say that from both an earnings perspective as well as a cash perspective. On the earnings front, as we go through this, it will become evident but our business performance was outstanding, and that all of the businesses generated significant productivity. 
And on the cash side where we experienced a usual first quarter use of funds, we set a first quarter record on days working capital, and we funded 1/3 of this year's pension contributions in cash. And lastly, as you'll see from both mine and Klaus's presentations, we're making meaningful progress on our strategic 3- and 5-year targets. 
So with that said, let's dive into the slides. First, a financial overview. Our income from continuing operations of $94 million was $0.09 a share. If you exclude the impact of restructuring and other special items, that bumps that up to $105 million or $0.10 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $624 million, that's up 40% sequentially. We had a free cash flow of negative $506 million, and as I alluded to, we had certain payments that are made in the first quarter that are annual or semiannual payments. We also had pension contributions of over $200 million in that number, and we had a working capital use of funds, albeit as you can see on the next bullet point, that was a days low record in the first quarter at 32 days. 
Our debt-to-cap was at 35.6%, which is a slight increase over the fourth quarter, yet our cash on hand remains at $1.7 billion. Lastly, we set several records in both our midstream and downstream businesses, and I'll highlight those for you right now. Now Global Rolled Products segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $96 million. We had EBITDA per metric ton, which is our margin measure in this business at $430 a metric ton, which was an all-time high. And the days working capital in this business was down 3 days year-over-year or a record first quarter of 42 days. 
If we move to the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $155 million. We achieved our quarterly EBITDA margin of 19.2% and that too was an all-time high. And we lowered days working capital 4 days to another first quarter low. One other point to mention in Engineered Products and Solutions is that ATOI now represents 52% of our total segment ATOI. 
Let's move on to the income statement. Okay. There's 3 items I'd really like to hit on the income statement before moving on. And the first has to do with revenue. Revenue was up slightly, both sequentially and year-over-year as you can see. On a sequential basis, we had alumina pricing down 8%, but that was more than overcome by primary prices being up 2%. And aerospace revenue, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation all showing increases, with automotive, industrial and commercial transportation up double digits. 
On a year-over-year basis, alumina pricing was down 13%, primary pricing was down 9%, aerospace, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation here again were up. If you go to COGS as a percent of sales, you can see that it's an improvement or down 240 basis points on a sequential basis and that's all attributed to volume, productivity and product mix. 
And lastly, the effective tax rate for the quarter stood at 28.3%, and if we're looking at an annual rate right now, it would be right at 27.5% would be our expectation for the full year. So that gave us a $0.09 a share before special items. 
Let's move on to the next slide and we'll check out the special items. We really only had 2 this quarter and they were fairly immaterial. We had additional severance cost related to the Spanish curtailments and that was $7 million, and then we had $4 million of non-cash mark-to-markets so the total of those 2 were special items of $11 million, and they took our $94 million income from ops up to $105 million, which is at $0.10 a share. 
Let's move on now to the sequential bridge. And this sequential bridge pretty much tells the story from an earnings perspective in looking at the green here in what our businesses were able to achieve. In fact, we went from a loss of $34 million before special items in the fourth quarter to a profit of $105 million so that's up $139 million sequentially. 
If you looked at the LME on net of FX, it's giving us $17 million improvement in the quarter as we saw a rise in aluminum prices partially offset by lower alumina prices. Volume, price, mix and productivity contributed $171 million in profit, and that offset the cost obviously of $49 million, $20 million of which related to pensions. 
So higher volumes generated profits of $29 million, 2/3 of that coming from Global Rolled Products and 1/3 from Engineered Products and Solutions. Our pricing mix also contributed $34 million, and that was driven by our higher mix of value-added products in our Primary business and improved mix of Global Rolled Products. We had prevailing cost headwinds that I alluded to, pension, cost increases, raw materials and energy, which were strongly offset by the productivity improvements. And just to give you a glimpse of the type of productivity improvements that we saw this quarter, they range from higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, scrap recovery and usage reductions. It's just a significant effort from all of our businesses, and obviously, the key factor in our earnings improvement. 
Now let's move on to the alumina segment. The alumina segment was actually the only segment with a sequential decrease in ATOI and went from $125 million to $35 million. Third-party revenue was down $775 million or 8.5% sequentially, and that's on the lower realized alumina prices. And we saw LME-linked alumina prices go down almost 5%, whereas API spot prices went down over 9%. So the API -- the ATOI change really, you could break up into a few different pieces. You've got the market's impact from the pricing and also, the A dollar strengthening about 5% against the U.S. dollar. You got the one-time land sale that took place in the fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter so that was an impact of $30 million. And then you got a productivity that's offsetting the cost increases, the $24 million of productivity more than offsetting the $11 million in cost increases. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we see the beginning of the quarter, the alumina surplus is continuing to be a drag on API and spot prices. And obviously, that has a lot to do with us recently announcing curtailments of a 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on alumina, and the production in the second quarter will be down as a result of that by 100,000 tons. We have -- we're going to incur maintenance expenses, some of which was just a timing between the first and the move to the second quarter, which will impact us by a negative $10 million in the second quarter, then we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Let's now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue in the Primary segment was $1,009,000,000 and that's down 2.4%, and really, it's comprised of 2 components. Our realized prices are actually up 2% sequentially, and our third-party shipments are down 4.2% as we ship more product internally. We had ATOI of $10 million and that's an increase from the loss of $32 million in the fourth quarter. The market, as you can see, the net of pricing and FX, the currency netted us an improvement of $25 million obviously on the higher LME prices. Yet, we also showed an improvement on product mix as our value-added products, particularly in North America provided us with $10 million. 
So our strong productivity gains came from process improvements and they generated $23 million. So if you were to take the productivity improvements and our mix improvements of $33 million, they will more than double the cost increases of $16 million that we incurred. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we expect production to be down 25,000 tons. It is the Spanish curtailments. We anticipate that we're going to start to see some of the benefit from lower raw material prices, and that will impact us by a positive $10 million. We have some planned maintenance activities at both our Rockdale and facilities, which will negatively impact us by $10 million. And the recent fire at the Messina facility in the Primary segment, we expect that, that will impact us somewhere between $9 million and $11 million. And as always, we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Now I'd like to move to the Global Rolled Products segment. The third-party shipments in the Global Rolled Products group were up 45,000 tons or 11.1%. It had a lot of do with the revenue going up to almost $1.9 billion or $159 million improvement or 9.2%. Strong end markets are driving the higher revenue was automotive, commercial transportation and packaging, all growing double digits over prior year -- over prior quarter, excuse me, with aerospace also seeing a sequential improvement. 
ATOI of $96 million for the quarter was up 269% sequentially, and you can see the 3 major benefits to us. We had $70 million of improved profitability coming from volume, price mix and productivity. The $20 million in higher volumes, driving higher capacity utilizations in North America, Europe and Australia. We got $25 million of favorable price mix and then $25 million coming from productivity, which really was derived from UBC utilization, which is scrap utilization for us, used containers, energy efficiency, sheet recovery and lower supply usage. 
Just to mention again, I think it's worthwhile mentioning again, this segment had outstanding results when you look at the records that they set, record first quarter ATOI, record all-time EBITDA per metric ton and record first quarter days working capital. 
As we look to the second quarter, we see seasonal increases in packaging demand. We also anticipate improvements in Russia and China with higher volumes and improved mix. Obviously, we think the productivity will continue but European markets remain uncertain. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions. Third-party revenue in Engineered Products and Solutions was $1.4 billion, that's up 3% sequentially but 11% year-over-year. ATOI was $155 million, which is a 27% increase over the fourth quarter. I'll mention again that this segment now represents 52% of our total segment's ATOI. 
The improved profitability is really coming from 3 main areas: increased revenue in aerospace, automotive and commercial wheels led to a volume improvement of $10 million. We had $4 million positive impact from price mix, and we also had $21 million in productivity improvements, driven by process improvements, particularly scrap and labor utilizations and procurement savings. Here again, records on all-time EBITDA margin of 19.2%, record first quarter ATOI and record days working capital. 
As we look to the second quarter, we're going to have an impact from the Messina fire between $8 million and $12 million. European building and construction market's going to be down quarter-over-quarter, but we think share gains and productivity will continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flow statement. We had cash from operations of a negative $236 million, and that led us to a negative free cash flow of $506 million. I had mentioned earlier, we had pension contributions of $213 million which was all cash. We estimate that will be about 1/3 of our pension contributions this year. In the taxes and other adjustments line of $202 million, we have some annual and semiannual payments that take place in that category, both interest payments and variable compensation. And then we had a use of working capital of $289 million, which I'll go through in just a minute. 
The debt-to-cap stood at 35.6 and we ended up with cash on hand of $1.7 billion. I mentioned earlier, the days working capital were a 7-day improvement and set a record for the first quarter. That would take us to the next slide. 
Okay. On the next slide, really, this chart is truly a great accomplishment. And it exhibits what our operations have been able to achieve, not only a consistent but a sustainable basis. Let me draw your attention to a few things. I've already mentioned the 7 days, and that's between first quarter of '11 and the first quarter of '12. This set an all-time record. That 7 days at today's level of working capital will be worth about $0.5 billion of cash. You go back to the first quarter of '09, as we were coming into the grips with the recession that was taking place and dealing with the drop-off in volumes and where we come from then, we're talking about a 23-day improvement, and at today's level, that would be worth about $1.5 billion of working capital. In fact, we had 10 quarters in a row of sustained year-over-year improvement in working capital, and the company is poised to continue this record. 
Now let's move on to the last slide where I hopefully can summarize what's been going on. If you look at the left-hand slide, you would see under executing our strategy, what our midterm strategic priorities and targets are. And in the upstream segment, it's coming down 7 points on the refining cost curve and 10 points on the smelting cost curve. And you can easily understand the significant value that would generate as we act on that. In fact, we have been acting on that. We're looking to either fix, close or curtail facilities, you've seen our actions around that. We've generated strong productivity gains in both of those segments, more than offsetting any cost increases, and we're obviously committed to hold those. And we're on growth -- we're on target on our growth projects. 
If you look to the midstream and downstream, you're looking at revenue generation growth of $2.5 billion in Global Rolled Products and $1.6 billion in Engineered Products and Solutions, you're seeing what we had accomplished in 2011, where we had accomplished 55% of that and 44% of that respectively in those 2 segments. And we've grown on top of that this year as we begun the year and at historical levels. So all 4 of these we think are significant value generators that we're committed to as we go to the remaining 2 and 4 years of these targets. 
But we also understand that we're managing this year for cash, and we're driving towards positive free cash flow. We're still committed to achieving that this year as I told you earlier. We're trying to fund our pension plan with cash and not use equity as well, and we're dedicated to doing that and have a great start of this year and accomplishing those targets as well. 
So with that being said, I'll now turn it over to Klaus."

Let's waste no time, get right straight into the overview on our end markets and then after going through the markets, we'll focus on what we're doing in our core. 
So let's start with this. So on summary, when you look at the chart, you see we pretty much see growth in all global end markets. North America strength with the only exception really is building and construction. China growth across all segments, a little softer but still good, good growth. Europe, hovering along, I would call that, and on aerospace, market goes from strength to strength. 
Let's start with aerospace. I mean, we have increased our growth projection by 3 percentage points to 13% to 14% growth this year. This is mainly driven by a stronger performance of the segments of commercial aircraft, which now has a combined backlog rolling in of that is of over 8,400 aircraft. That's clearly an improvement of more than 8 years. But we also see and that's new this quarter that the business that at that segment is coming back. We expect the growth of around 8%. However, this is the growth for the business, which is pretty much offset by the anticipated decline in the military output. 
Automotive, the next segment, with the exception of Europe, the automotive market is really a positive story. North America, strong in China continues to grow so we expect 2% to 7% growth on a worldwide basis. Let's stay for a moment in North America. We have increased our forecast by 2 percentage points so 7% to 12% for 2012. The year started strong with for the first-time since March at 2008 that the seasonally adjusted selling rate top 50 million vehicles in February. The run rate is not quite exactly there at the 14.5 million vehicles for the first 3 months. This is really still driven by the unusually high average fleet age, 10.6 years today versus the 10-year average of 9.4 years. 
Another positive sign, by the way, is that the vehicle incentives are down, around 15% versus the first 2 months in 2011. And another good news a year that shows the strength in America will most likely continue. The inventories are below historic norms. In March, 57 days, the historic norm is around 60 to 65 days, good news. 
Europe automotive is in EU27, it's down around 8.3% compared to last year am a really production is going to decline this year around 4% to 9% compared to last year. China automotive, China, the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers has recently stated that their forecast growth of 8% in 2012 will most likely not be met. The year has started up slow since we're down 6% year-over-year. But we believe China in general continues to grow well, and we expect 2% to 7% growth in the automotive market in China this year. 
Let's move onto next segment, heavy trucks and trailer. Globally, we expect 1% to 5% growth with strong differences across major regions. So let's start with North America. Truck projection continues to grow. We've seen the first 2 months production is up by 65% versus last year, 51,200 versus 31,000 last year. The backlog remains healthy at historic norms at around 121,000 vehicles, and net orders recently are a little lower through March, minus 16%, 67,600 versus 80,500. But the 3 months running average remains robust at around 270,000 annualized so we project the growth in North America between 7% and 12%. 
Europe 27, truck registrations are down by 2.5%. We expect a 3% to 8% production decline. This is a combination of 2 factors of the domestic demand reduction as well as the dampening effect by the export demand. Export demand is declining but declining not toward the same rate than the internally EU27 demand. China, last but not least here on heavy trucks and trailer, we expect 0% to 5% growth this year, first 2 months. The first month actually started slow, but if you look at several reductions, it's around 76,000. If you annualize that, you actually end up with 911,000. That would be 10% up from last year's 823,000 so that's pretty good, and we talked about a little more in as I go through the presentation on the buildout that is supposed to happen and happening in western China, and that certainly will have up positive impact on trucks and trailer. Also demand also in China. 
So next segment, beverage cans and packaging. We continue to expect that global growth of around 2% to 3%. China, Brazil, Middle East, North Africa, Europe continue to lead the growth here, it's all good. For the world's largest market, which is North America, very moderately declines although and that's also an interesting news to watch. The first 2 months, we had shown an increase of 5.6% so obviously, it's too early to call the trends although we would like to call the trends obviously. And we'd love to see it that way. 
So next segment here, commercial building and construction. That's really the around North America and Europe. I'm not telling you any news here, continues to be under pressure by China and other emerging markets continuing to grow. If you add it all of you put together, you see global growth between 2.5% to 3.5% but it's really to that you're seeing there. 
Last but not least the segment of industrial, we expect the market to be up between 1% to 2%, and this was a combination of new builds to be have, that you're getting offset by the spare parts inventory overhang that exists there. With all else going on in the energy markets, we remain very bullish in the midterm for the industrial gas to wing markets. 
Let's conclude to the end market side, and let's now see how this reflects on the demand for aluminum. Let's have our aluminum demand slide on. Thank you very much. So what you're seeing here is pretty much the same picture that I showed you last time. The demand projection hasn't changed much. We've tempered it down by 200,000 tons, which is really nothing in the larger or scheme of things, and this is purely coming from Asia. 
On the growth rate side, it doesn't affect the growth rate other than on the third digits. The global demand continues to be around 7%, that's all projection for this year, and we believe that, that's pretty accurate going to happen. And you see that if you compare it with what we showed you in the last quarter, you will see that we've taken China and Asia down by 1 percentage points but it still means we're projecting for China, 11% growth and for Asia without China, 8 percentage points growth. And we also remain confident about the consumption increased patterns that we're seeing in North America, Brazil, India and Russia. So that's all good. 
What does that mean for supply demand? So let's move to the next slide. On the left-hand side, you see the primary demand supply situation. We believe that the overall, we continue to see a deficit there. In the usual fashion, growth is down and the table below into China and the Rest of the World, and as you can see, this is mainly stemming from China and the rest of the world is essentially balanced. 
If you go to the right-hand side, you see the alumina side, and there's the change that's happening here in the quarter. Some of also reflect the in the alumina price and Chuck reflected on it in his presentation already. The alumina market has moved into a surplus, particularly in the Rest of the World. Once again, I mean, you saw what we announced earlier this week. I mean, we have taken actions here and announced refining curtailments, 390,000 tons in the Atlantic regions. This is by the way already built in and kind of consummated in the chart that you see down here. So the overhang that we project in the Rest of the World in the alumina market is around 1 million tons for this year. 
So let's now focus for a second on the Chinese market, but before we go there, let me remind those that don't follow the Chinese market so strongly, what is the structural situation that we see in the Chinese aluminum industry? And here are some hard facts. About 80% of all refineries are in the highest cost compared on the global cost curve. That basically means if you chunk it up into quartiles in the third and fourth quartiles, these are the highest quartiles, right? On the smelter, 87% of all smelters in China are in these highest quartiles, the third and the fourth quartile. 60% of all bauxite and this is the latest numbers, that China needs for the refinery and the smelting that's imported. 90-plus percent of and refineries use coal-based energy so this is obviously one of the factors why you would later that the emission is well above what you see in the industrial norm. And I want to remind you, if you look at our core, we use 2/3 of the smelter energy that we use stems from hydropower. 
So if you add this all up, you can already see that this is not a very healthy and not a very competitive industry structure. We believe and we've talked about that at length many, many times that currently with the pricing pressure, about 1/3 of the smelting capacity in China is cash negative. So now, what we want to focus on and let's bring the next slide on the new story that's around. The new story is yes, Klaus, this is all going to change because China is moving to the West, and this is all going to change and with the move to the west, you're going to see a totally different industry. 
So let's take a look what is the truth that we're seeing here. First of all, you see here -- no, no, no, let's go back. We see here on the right-hand side, you see what's currently the projection, how this move is really going to happen, all right? So basically, you see on the right-hand side the projection until 2015 means 10 million tons are supposed to get added here in terms of capacity, right? And you see a breakdown here by the regions. And you saw on the left-hand side, you see this -- the graph that shows you where exactly that is. The majority of the expansion as you see is on the northwest, and particularly if you break it down here and to specific regions, there's really 3 regions that are very strong. It's, it's been high and Inner Mongolia and that's reason for it. And the reason is that the stranded coal and the stranded coal is going to bring the power cost down so that's the whole logic. 
What's surprising when you look at is that also buildout in the East but there's also a very simple explanation for it. This is not going to be greenfield. This is brownfield expansion, and most of those are happening in a province called Shandong and Shandong has coal reserve. So the thing largely pretty much that is behind the move to the West. So let's turn the factual situation as much as you can project it. 
So let's now take a look at if the scenario were to happen, what exactly would that lead to, right? And that's go to the next slide. All right. This is a complicated slide so bear with me. It takes me a couple of minutes to go through, and I try to be quick but stay with me. So let's start with the left-hand slide. So first, to get this 10 million tons of smelting in place, you would have to build 13 miles in smelters, right? In addition, you would also have to build 150 million-megawatt hours of power generation. So 17,000-megawatt hours of generating capacity. And even if you assume low Chinese construction costs, it would still add up and only for smelting and power, not refining some mining built into that. That alone would already add up to an investment of $45 billion, right? 
Now you can say well, there's also positive social impact coming through it, granted. And ours -- our assessment is this is probably going to bring 100,000 jobs once this is all built to the non-Western provinces but the first is simple one. Actually already see that this is coming at a price because every job will cost you about $450,000, right? 
So now, look at the slide on the lower left-hand side, right, and that has 2 dimensions. And it has the dimension on the X axis, on the Y axis basically, it says, if you were to invest in a certain industry RMB 1 million, how many jobs would you get for RMB 1 million? On the X axis, it says for the same RMB 1 million, this industry is going to require energy. And the logic is because energy is a scarce resource in China, now positions the different industries in that -- in this grid. 
And the size of the bubble here is the total energy demand so the bigger to energy of this industry but the demand for RMB 1 million is defined by the on the right-hand side. The blue bubble here is our industry. That's on industry. And what you see here is if you compare that to other industries, the non-ferrous metal industry has a relatively small leverage in terms of job generation. But it's a high level of in terms of eating up scarce resources namely energy, right? So that's what you get here, and I'm sure there are other people are looking at that. 
So the summary there is still with assessing the investment here, you have to put massive investment there, and I think you would be with me to say well you probably get a little so that's the first thing, keep in mind. So let's go to the middle column here, right? And the middle column talks about the sustainability. And the sustainability, let's start with the CO2 emissions. 10 million tons and the respective power that would have to be generated mostly done by coal, pretty much all done by coal, that's the logic of moving there, we talked about that, has gone and 142 million tons of CO2. That is twice the amount that -- that this would happen if you just apply industry average, work industry average. That is pretty much driven by using coal and we talked about that before. 
But that's only one perspective. The other fascinating perspective is the aspect of water because you absolutely need quite a bit of water particularly for coal-fired power plants. And the interesting thing is at least I found interesting is that the chart here in the middle, the chart in the middle -- in the middle lower box here is all provinces in China, and it shows the amount of water in the respective provinces. The coded in red are those 3 provinces that are in the main, the ones where the move to the northwest is going. So it is quite surprising to see them on the right-hand side of this chart, meaning that already today, they are not very -- it's not very beneficially, I mean, pleasantly gifted by having lots of water resources. 
In fact, I mean the water scarcity asked by further in those provinces because the amount of water that you would need for the 10 million tons per annum is equivalent to the water used about 1.4 million people that needs to live 2 or 3 years. So that's the second part of things. 
So let's go to the third thing because you say there's probably a big cost advantage, because all of that, I mean let's have a big so look at the right-hand side on the upper chart there, which plots the global cost position, and we broke this down into obviously the 4 quartiles and then we split the bars into what's the northwest and what's in the West basically, right? 
Now if you add that up, you actually get to the number that I mentioned before that today, 87% of all the smelter capacity in China is in the third or the fourth quartile. Okay, no surprise there. So how is that going to change if you apply the assumption of what we just on the line that, right? And say 2015, well, it's going to get to 80% of the smelting capacity, then being in the third and fourth quartiles. Granted, that's a move but it comes at a pretty high price, right? 
And one thing you can already take away from that side alone is that, that doesn't look like a threat to the worldwide supply because from there, you -- from that competitive position or lack of competitive position, you will certainly not attack with export. 
So let's summarize these 3 things, least how I would summarize that. You would need massive investments, you would increase your sustainability issues, granted you have some social returns but I would still call the to what you would get in other industries and you would almost make no improvement on the cost curve. So obviously, it's for China to evaluate whether this is really the right way to move forward, and I think that's exactly what's going to happen. China will evaluate whether this is the right move forward. I thought that's important to clarify what is going to happen here and subtract the mystery from the reality, right? 
So let's now move up as we come to this, granted little complicated slide, and I'll do some more of the things like regional premiums and inventories. So what do we see on the regional premium side here? I mean, the regional premiums are back to -- has risen substantially as you see there in the last quarter, and they are back to historic highs. That's a very good assumption as you all know by continued strong physical demand and increased interest in financing metal and increased interest in financing metals is a function again of the widening contango and a low interest rate and you know that environment is sustaining and in fact has increased if you look at the last quarter. 
If you then look at the inventory situation, and we again try to put the visible and the so-called invisible inventory together. And you see that this has increased by 500,000 tons from the last quarter. This is almost all China. And the reason for that is a very simple reason, we believe. You saw in the previous slide, the capacity is ramping up, the build is ramping up. At the same time, the first quarter is marked by the lunar year, the change of the lunar year, which typically is the biggest holiday, typically, a lot of end customers are shopping the facilities down, which leads to a disruption of the logistics, which leads to a buildup of the starts and we've seen that year in, a year out. So we believe this coming into a time when production ramps up, that's simply what we see here reflected with the 500,000 tons. So this is kind of in our view, this is going through ripple through. 
You see something else here? I want to mention that. Automotive price for the of all market, you see the LME canceled warrants are going up. We've talked about that again purely a function of the contango widening and people seeing the lower term financing being attractive. 
So as the last thing what I'd like to close with, the market discussion with some macro views and some more macroeconomic indicators here. So and that probably comes, let's start with a 10-year bond yields and Europe, and frankly, I mean if there's one thing one can read into that is volatility, looking at what has been happening in the last days, volatility persists after a time when they come down, you now see them coming up again. 
Volatility persisting there but that is just one indicator. We should be really careful and getting totally obsessed by one indicator. There's a lot of other indicators that I think have shown good prognostic value. Look at consumer confidence. Consumer confidence improved in all 3 major regions, China, Europe as well as the U.S. And look at the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index. U.S., China, clearly above the 50 mark and improving, Europe still below the 50 mark. 
You've seen that this had an impact on the first quarter on the commodity prices but the volatility remains and you've seen putting some pressure on pricing in the last couple of updates. 
So with that, let me move over from the markets to how do we see Alcoa and what is Alcoa doing in this environment. And I want to spend a little time -- Chuck has characterized the quarter. Chuck has also given some ideas about how do we see Q2 looking. So let me focus on something that increasingly, people are interested in and cover it for all of you. What do we do on the mid- to long-term basis? And remind you of some of the things that are in place and then you can see how the pieces are fitting together. 
And it has to start with our approach of how we're accreting value, our 3 strategic priorities. We are clearly focusing on profitable growth and that's the focus. On cost, growth, innovation in cash and all of that happening in parallel, and you see it reflected again in this quarter, right? 
Second strategic priority is the Alcoa advantage, using our capabilities in generating, bringing on board is developed, talent and technology, customer intimacy, purchasing, operating system, our performance dialogue today the P&L, all of this, we need to be -- and I'm saying it always to our folks, we've got to earn the right to own each one of the businesses everyday. We have to show that we are a better parent than any other one owning this asset. And the only way that I can show it is bite consistent superior performance. 
And last but not least, it's the third strategic priorities of execution and I think as you reflect the last years, you will be with me to say they have been anything but easy and you seen that again in the last quarter. They do what we say and we do go the extra mile. 
The next slide, this slide here, some of you have seen and those of you haven't seen it should be seeing it when you invest in our core because they are pretty much tells you what we're doing. Because we said and end of 2010, we set aggressive midterm targets. And midterm targets are broken down into the 3 segments. Upstream, we said because we said we're going to come down on the cost curve until 2015. 7 percentage points on the refinery cost curve, 10 percentage points on the smelting cost. And the first decisions -- the first decisive steps we've taken, I'll talk a little bit more about it. 
On the midstream, we said we can do this until 2013 at $2.5 billion, revenues, incremental revenues and doing all of that by exceeding the historic margin levels. The same on downstream, $1.6 billion incremental revenues exceeding historic margin levels. 
So how exactly are we going to do that? And let me read through each one of those segments so that you understand that this is a detailed plan of action that we are executing and that we see as our true north. So let's start with the alumina segment. You focus on the low -- upper left box because that really tells you how are we going to come down 7 percentage points on the cost curve. It starts with optimizing the portfolio and that's going to give us 2 to 3 percentage points. And go to the right-hand side here, where restructuring our high-cost assets. This is out you can do it and principal and we're doing it to solve the announcement, we are curtailing 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on the refining side. 
In addition to that, and in parallel with riding on the cost curve by production, our lower cost facilities and the rest of west Australia, last year, record production, great profitability up 23% and all of that was no extra capital. That's the best thing that you can get, right? 
So that's one thing. 2% to 3% coming from that move. The next thing is moving to less expensive energy, right where we are moving over to gas, that's one percentage point down the cost curve. Saudi Arabia is going to give us 2 percentage points and then productivity is going to give us 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Then in addition to that, kind of the cream on top is when we introduce the alumina pricing index, aligning the price more to market fundamentals. Today, we have 33% of all customers on EPI hotspot and we actually promised we're going to increase that over the years as the opportunities come up. 
The second thing is aluminum now. Same logic. Left upper box shows you how we're going to drive down 10 percentage points on the cost curve. Starts again with the portfolio, right? On the right-hand side, you see what we're doing and here again, you see the announcement of 530,000 tons that we took up and we saw -- you see here, we've basically been using every single one I believe of said see you can use when you restructured the high cost. High costs are we would continue to do that and always have in mind with other cash and locations of that, right? 
The second thing that we're go to do is due also here on the structuring the portfolio is looking at monetization, looking at opportunities to lower the cost curve with good assets. So one of these examples is our Canadian system should become more, we have recent agreements with X smelters basically reaching until 2040. East is another opportunity there existing modernization portfolio, which would include a 30 to 40 years of competitive power cost. That alone is going to bring us down 2% to 3% down the cost curve, the monetization part. Then comes Saudi Arabia, not only let's go back, another 2 percentage points on the cost curve and then productivity, 1 to 2 percentage points on the cost curve. 
The upside here, comparable to API on the revenue side on the value-add side is our. Basically, optimizing, optimizing the product mix and using the value-add situation more. Last year, we increased the way -- we professionalized the way we're using that and you can see the results we got $262 million more margins purely from the, purely from that optimization. 
Next slide. Talking about Saudi Arabia, I mentioned it twice already, and here is an update on our growth project in Saudi Arabia. The pictures show the current status, that's a week old probably you can see the line, the carbon plan, the liquid pitch tanks, the hot reversing mills. As you know, there are 2 phases, one is coming online in 2013 and the other one in 2014. I think the picture tell you at least one story. It's on time until you another story, it's budget and both things come well together up, right? So this is a great, great example of the. I mean, it's an integrated facility, mining, refining, smoking to rolling and really, this is only profitable through the Alcoa expertise and our reputation and our financial strength. 
Let's move on to the next segment. So this tells you the story how we're moving down the upstream business on the cost curve. Next one is how we're going to build out the global road curve. And here, there's $2.5 billion and higher profitability. Now the great news is 55% of the $2.5 billion incremental revenues have been reached in the first year, that's pretty cool, right? 
So the other thing that's equally outstanding is the profitability that we see in the first quarter. I mean, look at that, $430 is -- $430 per EBITDA per metric ton, the 10-year average is at $235, right? And you see -- I mean how that sits out, swirly so let's look a little closer at how GRP is going to get to those targets. 
Let's start doesn't end with aerospace. Here are the major platforms in aerospace. You see the build rates there and you actually do see that the build rates overall by 2013 have increased by 27%, that's pretty substantial. The good news is we are in pretty much every one of those and many more platforms but those are the big platforms. And that's an excellent position that we have. In addition, the decision of Europe of Airbus and Boeing have the A320 and the B747 as all aluminum planes and use them with innovative aluminum lithium obviously adds to it. This all provides a great platform for revenue as well as margin growth, GRP Simon our global business, revenues we believe we can increase in this segment alone by 22% by 2013. 
As I said, this is not the only great segment to be in, packaging is another one. We have growth in there that varies between 4% to 20%, 20% is probably right on the high side in China that is. We are leading in some core regions. We are expanding like an Saudi Arabia and innovation you see on the rep left inside aluminum bottles with innovations in that field. Same thing holds true for automotive North America. Those 34% we've talked about that before but it's worth reminding everybody. Fuel efficiency standard is the big driver, light weighting is the name of the game. We are putting money behind we are expanding dam for $300 million. Most of the capacity to where but it is already permitted. And the good news also is would all of that would not be possible if we wouldn't have driven close innovation, so making the -- working with aluminum and other materials in the manufacturing process, bringing the barriers to change from steel to aluminum down substantially. 
Last segment I want to talk about here is Consumer Electronics. Growth through that we see here is 18% and the only thing I want to say is we are aluminizing also this aeronautics. So besides from the of our materials that lightweight probability any customers today are proceeding more on sustainability and they're seeing this is a gigantic advantage. We have a material that truly is infinitely recyclable, and that drives this statistic of 75% of all aluminum ever produced in history on this planet still being used. 
So how is that all going to work? Well, there's another cream on top of it and our Global Rolled Products business and this is our increased presence in the emerging markets like Russia and China. That's nice. In Russia, we have established ourself already as a key domestic supplier in some of the markets like packaging, aero and commercial and transportation. Nice performance last year. On the profit side as well as on the growth side and we're working continuously all to a new application. So Russia, we are already nicely established. In China, we are establishing ourself. We have reached a positive EBITDA last year. We had a great joint venture partner that we will work with even more so in the midstream segment here with a Chinese power investment corporation, signed a joint venture and we're focusing particularly on the growth in this segment, and we also see that there are growing segments, we're growing, we're starting to become a reliable supplier for the automotive sector, and we're growing into the Consumer Electronics market. 
So that's how GRP is going to do. Last but not least, let's talk about Engineered Products and Solutions. This is a great success story and we are on path for the 2013 target. Starts with the growth, we achieved 44% of the growth target of $1.6 billion in the first year after announcement. And guess what, they achieved that and also this quarter, another record performance, 19% margin, the highest ever quarter. So EPS continues to grow at margin of historic levels. 
So and if you haven't noticed that yet, I mean, EPS this quarter is contributing more than 50% to our core profits. So if you look at the out of this $1.6 billion of growth, $600 million are coming from the market and it's really important to understand what is our market position here? Let's start again with aerospace. You see this is the product in aerospace. It's pretty much all of them and the #1 or #2 position and this represents 47% of all revenues and the market is growing 13% to 14%, that alone is already wonderful position to be in. 
You go to heavy trucks and trailer. Again, we are in there that we're in North America. #1 position, clearly #1, represents 16% of the total revenue basis. North America growing 7% to 12%, wonderful. #1 position, represent 10% and it's a gross margin of 1% to 2% this year but as I said early on, I'm very, very convinced that this market has a very strong future going forward. 
The only outlier in the way is the nonresidential construction market not because we don't have a great position in there, we do have a great position there and the U.S. particularly but because it's currently not growing but I'd also that I believe one day will change. 
So let's talk about the other part, the other $1 billion. I mean, $600 million, I talked about here in the market, the $1 billion comes to innovation, right? And innovation is pretty much the middle name of our Engineered Products and Solutions business. I mean, here you see on this slide put a number of examples. I don't have the time to go through all of them but I'll pick one out, just that you get a feel for the value that we're bringing. I'll pick out the next-generation Engine Air Force. And just keep in mind, the jet engine OEMs are now announcing their next-generation jet engine. 
And here are some statistics. 15%, reduced fuel consumption, 50% percent reduced emissions, 30% improved maintenance cycle. 15% percent noise reduction. The Air Force are critically enabler for that. Things with our advanced cooling the 3D platform core technologies, our substantial driver for better cooling and that allows higher temperature in the burn chamber. The high-grade single twist technology alone allows us to increase the melting point up to 12%. And the technology brings the weight down by 20%. I think you get a feel for how substantial these type of technologies and these type of offerings are driving the value for our customers. That's why I'm really optimistic how we're going to reach this $1.6 billion. 
And last but not least, there's also the aspect of organic growth, and I want to point out, we will continue to look for acquisitions. We've done that in the last year very successes. You see here on the left side probably critical trends fasteners, all of these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, increase our share and grow our profitability, and we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our portfolio and also to create value to our shareholders. 
Let's come to an end here. We have a strong start in 2012. We're delivering our promises for the markets are stabilizing. We're executing on our strategy. We're delivering results. Our upstream business moving on the cost curve and deliver strong productivity gains our midstream record profitability, good growth. Our downstream Engineered Products and Solutions record profitability, good growth, cash management, outstanding Chuck referred to it and all of that works with leveraging all that cool advances from talent to technology so we are well prepared for the future with our whatever it brings with the near future is now to open the lines to you all to ask questions and us to give answers. So thank you very much."

Welcome, everyone, and thanks for taking the time and joining us today. Look, before we dive into the slides, I'd just like to make a few introductory comments, if I could. And we think we started the year with an excellent first quart",2577,"Yes, thanks, Kelly. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for taking the time and joining us today. Look, before we dive into the slides, I'd just like to make a few introductory comments, if I could. And we think we started the year with an excellent first quarter, and I say that from both an earnings perspective as well as a cash perspective. On the earnings front, as we go through this, it will become evident, but our business performance was outstanding and that all of the businesses generated significant productivity. And on the cash side where we experienced the usual first quarter use of funds, we set a first quarter record on days working capital, and we funded 1/3 of this year's pension contributions in cash. And lastly, as you'll see from both mine and Klaus' presentations, we're making meaningful progress on our strategic 3- and 5-year targets. 
So with that said, let's dive into the slides. First, a financial overview. Our income from continuing operations of $94 million was $0.09 a share. If you exclude the impact of restructuring and other special items, that bumps that up to $105 million or $0.10 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $624 million. That's up 40% sequentially. We had a free cash flow of negative $506 million, and as I alluded to, we had certain payments that are made in the first quarter that are annual or semiannual payments. We also had pension contributions of over $200 million in that number, and we had a working capital use of funds, albeit, as you can see on the next bullet point, that was a days low record in the first quarter at 32 days. 
Our debt-to-cap was at 35.6%, which is a slight increase over the fourth quarter, yet our cash on hand remains at $1.7 billion. Lastly, we set several records in both our midstream and downstream businesses, and I'll highlight those for you right now. 
In our Global Rolled Products segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $96 million. We had EBITDA per metric ton, which is our margin measure in this business, at $430 a metric ton, which was an all-time high. And the days working capital in this business was down 3 days year-over-year for a record first quarter of 42 days. 
If we move to the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $155 million. We achieved our quarterly EBITDA margins of 19.2%, and that, too, was an all-time high. And we lowered days working capital 4 days to another first quarter low. One other point to mention in Engineered Products and Solutions is that ATOI now represents 52% of our total segment ATOI. 
Let's move on to the income statement. Okay, there's 3 items I'd really like to hit on the income statement before moving on, and the first has to do with revenue. Revenue was up slightly, both sequentially and year-over-year as you can see. On a sequential basis, we had alumina pricing down 8%, but that was more than overcome by primary prices being up 2%. And aerospace revenue, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation all showing increases, with automotive, industrial and commercial transportation up double digits. 
On a year-over-year basis, alumina pricing was down 13%, primary pricing was down 9%, aerospace, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation here again were up. If you go to COGS as a percent of sales, you can see that it's an improvement, or down 240 basis points on a sequential basis, and that's all attributed to volume, productivity and product mix. 
And lastly, the effective tax rate for the quarter stood at 28.3%. And if we're looking at an annual rate right now, it would be right at 27.5% would be our expectation for the full year. So that gave us a $0.09 a share before special items. 
Let's move on to the next slide and we'll check out the special items. We really only had 2 this quarter, and they were fairly immaterial. We had additional severance costs related to the Spanish curtailments, and that was $7 million, and then we had $4 million of non-cash mark-to-markets. So the total of those 2 were special items of $11 million, and they took our $94 million income from ops up to $105 million, which is the $0.10 a share. 
Let's move on now to the sequential bridge. And this sequential bridge pretty much tells the story from an earnings perspective, in looking at the green here in what our businesses were able to achieve. In fact, we went from a loss of $34 million before special items in the fourth quarter to a profit of $105 million. So that's up $139 million sequentially. 
If you looked at the LME on net of FX, it's giving us $17 million improvement in the quarter as we saw a rise in aluminum prices partially offset by lower alumina prices. Volume, price, mix and productivity contributed $171 million in profit, and that offset the cost, obviously, of $49 million, $20 million of which related to pensions. 
The higher volumes generated profits of $29 million, 2/3 of that coming from Global Rolled Products and 1/3 from Engineered Products and Solutions. Our price and mix also contributed $34 million, and that was driven by a higher mix of value-added products in our Primary business and improved mix of Global Rolled Products. 
We had prevailing cost headwinds that I alluded to, pension, cost increases, raw materials and energy, which were strongly offset by the productivity improvements. And just to give you a glimpse of the type of productivity improvements that we saw this quarter, they range from higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, scrap recovery and usage reductions. It's just a significant effort from all of our businesses and, obviously, the key factor in our earnings improvement. 
Now let's move on to the Alumina segment. The Alumina segment was actually the only segment with a sequential decrease in ATOI and went from $125 million to $35 million. Third-party revenue was down $775 million, or 8.5% sequentially, and that's on a lower realized alumina prices. And there we saw LME-linked alumina prices go down almost 5%, whereas API spot prices went down over 9%. So the API -- the ATOI change really, you could break up into a few different pieces. You've got the market's impact from the pricing and also, the A dollar strengthening about 5% against the U.S. dollar. You've got the onetime land sale that took place in the fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter. So that was an impact of $30 million. And then you got a productivity that's offsetting the cost increases, the $24 million of productivity more than offsetting the $11 million in cost increases. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we see -- the beginning of the quarter, the alumina surplus is continuing to be a drag on API and spot prices. And obviously, that has a lot to do with us recently announcing curtailments of 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on alumina, and the production in the second quarter will be down as a result of that by 100,000 tons. We have -- we're going to incur maintenance expenses, some of which was just a timing between the first and has moved to the second quarter, which will impact us by a negative $10 million in the second quarter, yet we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Let's now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue in the Primary segment was $1,009,000,000, and that's down 2.4% and really is comprised of 2 components. Our realized prices are actually up 2% sequentially, but our third-party shipments are down 4.2% as we shipped more product internally. We had ATOI of $10 million, and that's an increase from a loss of $32 million in the fourth quarter. The market, as you can see, the net of pricing and FX, the currency netted us an improvement of $25 million obviously on the higher LME prices. Yet, we also showed an improvement on product mix as our value-added products, particularly in North America, provided us with $10 million. So our strong productivity gains came from process improvements, and they generated $23 million. So if you were to take the productivity improvements and our mix improvements of $33 million, they will more than double the cost increases of $16 million that we incurred. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we expect production to be down 25,000 tons due to the Spanish curtailments. We anticipate that we're going to start to see some of the benefit from lower raw material prices and that will impact us by a positive $10 million. We have some planned maintenance activities at both our Rockdale and Warrick power facilities, which will negatively impact us by $10 million. And the recent fire at the Massena facility in the Primary segment, we expect that, that will impact us somewhere between $9 million and $11 million. And as always, we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Now I'd like to move to the Global Rolled Products segment. The third-party shipments in the Global Rolled Products group were up 45,000 tons or 11.1%, and that had a lot of do with the revenue going up to almost $1.9 billion or $159 million improvement or 9.2%. Strong end markets or driving the higher revenue were automotive, commercial transportation and packaging, all growing double digits over prior year -- over prior quarter, excuse me, with aerospace also seeing a sequential improvement. 
ATOI of $96 million for the quarter was up 269% sequentially, and you can see the 3 major benefits to us. We had $70 million of improved profitability coming from volume, price/mix and productivity. The $20 million in higher volumes are driving higher capacity utilizations in North America, Europe and Australia. We've got $25 million of favorable price/mix, and then $25 million coming from productivity, which really was derived from UBC utilization, which is scrap utilization for us, used beverage containers, energy efficiency, sheet recovery and lower supply usage. 
Just to mention again, I think it's worthwhile mentioning again, this segment had outstanding results when you look at the records that they set: record first quarter ATOI, record all-time EBITDA per metric ton and record first quarter days working capital. 
As we look to the second quarter, we see seasonal increases in packaging demand. We also anticipate improvements in Russia and China with higher volumes and improved mix. Obviously, we think that productivity will continue, but European markets remain uncertain. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions. Third-party revenue in Engineered Products and Solutions was $1.4 billion, and that's up 3% sequentially but 11% year-over-year. ATOI was $155 million, which is a 27% increase over the fourth quarter. I'll mention again that this segment now represents 52% of our total segment's ATOI. 
The improved profitability is really coming from 3 main areas: increased revenue in aerospace, automotive and commercial wheels led to a volume improvement of $10 million; we had $4 million positive impact from price/mix; and we also had $21 million in productivity improvements, driven by process improvements, particularly scrap and labor utilizations and procurement savings. Here again, records on all-time EBITDA margin of 19.2%, record first quarter ATOI and record days working capital. Excuse me.
As we look to the second quarter, we're going to have an impact from the Massena fire, between $8 million and $12 million. European building and construction market's going to be down quarter-over-quarter, but we think share gains and productivity will continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flow statement. We had cash from operations of a negative $236 million, and leading -- that led us to a negative free cash flow of $506 million. I had mentioned earlier we had pension contributions of $213 million, which was all cash. We estimate that will be about 1/3 of our pension contributions this year. In the taxes and other adjustments line of $202 million, we have some annual and semiannual payments that take place in that category, both interest payments and variable compensation. And then we had a use of working capital of $289 million, which I'll go through in just a minute. 
The debt-to-cap stood at 35.6%, and we ended with cash on hand of $1.7 billion. I mentioned earlier the days working capital were a 7-day improvement and set a record for the first quarter. That would take us to the next slide. 
Okay, on the next slide. Really, this chart is truly a great accomplishment, and it exhibits what our operations have been able to achieve, not only a consistent but a sustainable basis. Let me draw your attention to a few things. I've already mentioned the 7 days, and that's between the first quarter of '11 and the first quarter of '12. This set an all-time record. That 7 days at today's level of working capital would be worth about $0.5 billion of cash. But go back to the first quarter of '09 as we were coming into grips with the recession that was taking place and dealing with the drop-off in volumes and where we come from then. You're talking about a 23-day improvement. And at today's level, that would be worth about $1.5 billion of working capital. In fact, we had 10 quarters in a row of sustained year-over-year improvement in working capital, and the company is poised to continue this record. 
Now let's move on to the last slide where I hopefully can summarize what's been going on. If you look at the left-hand side, you would see under Executing Our Strategy what our midterm strategic priorities and targets are. And in the upstream segment, it's coming down 7 points on the refining cost curve and 10 points on the smelting cost curve. And you can easily understand the significant value that would generate as we act on that. In fact, we have been acting on that. We're looking to either fix, close or curtail facilities. You've seen our actions around that. We generated strong productivity gains in both of those segments, more than offsetting any cost increases, and we're obviously committed to hold those. And we're on growth -- we're on target on our growth projects. 
If you look to the midstream and downstream, you're looking at revenue generation growth of $2.5 billion in Global Rolled Products and $1.6 billion in Engineered Products and Solutions. You're seeing where we -- what we had accomplished through 2011, where we had accomplished 55% of that and 44% of that, respectively, in those 2 segments, and we've grown on top of that this year as we've begun the year and at historical levels. So all 4 of these, we think, are significant value generators that we're committed to as we go through the remaining 2 and 4 years of these targets. 
But we also understand that we're managing this year for cash, and we're driving towards positive free cash flow. We're still committed to achieving that this year. As I told you earlier, we're trying to fund our pension plan with cash and not use equity as well, and we're dedicated to doing that and have a great start to this year in accomplishing those targets as well. 
So with that being said, I'll now turn it over to Klaus."

Let's waste no time, get right straight into the overview on our end markets. And then after going through the markets, we'll focus on what we are doing in our core. So let's",6264,"Well, thank you very much, Chuck, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Let's waste no time, get right straight into the overview on our end markets. And then after going through the markets, we'll focus on what we are doing in our core. 
So let's start with this. So in summary, when you look at the chart, you see we pretty much see growth in all global end markets. North America has strength, and the only exception really is building and construction. China had growth across all segments, a little softer but still good, good growth. Europe, hovering along, I would call that. And on aerospace, the market goes from strength to [indiscernible] strength. 
Let's start with aerospace. I mean, we have increased our growth projection by 3 percentage points to 13% to 14% growth this year. This is mainly driven by a stronger performance of the segment of large commercial aircraft, which now has a combined backlog, Boeing and Airbus that is, of over 8,400 aircraft. So that's the equivalent of more than 8 years. But we also see, and that's new this quarter, that the business jet segment is coming back. We expect a growth of around 8%. However, this -- the growth from business jet was pretty much offset by the anticipated decline in the military output. 
Automotive, the next segment, with the exception of Europe, the automotive market is really a positive story. North America, strong, and China continues to grow. So we expect 2% to 7% growth on a worldwide basis. 
Let's stay for a moment with North America. We have increased our forecast by 2 percentage points, so 7% to 12% for 2012. The year started strong, well, the first time since March 2008 that the seasonally adjusted selling rate topped 50 million vehicles in February. The run rate is not quite exactly there at the 14.5 million vehicles for the first 3 months. This is really still driven by the unusually high average fleet rate -- fleet age, 10.6 years today versus the 10-year average of 9.4 years. 
Another positive sign, by the way, is that the vehicle incentives are down around 15% versus the first 2 months in 2011. And another good news here that shows the strength in America will most likely continue, the inventories are below historic norms in March, 57 days. The historic norm is around 60 to 65 days. Good news. 
Europe automotive in EU27, sales are down around 8.3% compared to last year. We believe production is going to decline this year around 4% to 9% compared to last year. 
China automotive, China -- the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers has recently stated that their forecast growth of 8% in 2012 will most likely not be met. The year has started out slow. The sales were down 6% year-over-year. But we believe China in general continues to grow well, and we expect 2% to 7% growth in the automotive market in China this year. 
Let's move on to next segment, heavy trucks and trailer. Globally, we expect 1% to 5% growth with strong differences across major regions. So let's start with North America. Truck projection continues to grow. We've seen the first 2 months' production is up by 65% versus last year, 51,200 versus 31,000 last year. The backlog remains healthy at historic norms at around 121,000 vehicles, and net orders recently are a little lower through March, minus 16%, 67,600 versus 80,500. But the 3 months' running average remains robust at around 270,000 annualized, so we project the growth in North America between 7% and 12%. 
Europe 27, truck registrations are down by 2.5%. We expect a 3% to 8% production decline, and this is a combination of 2 factors of the domestic demand reduction as well as the dampening effect by the export demand. Export demand is declining but declining not toward the same rate than the internal EU27 demand. 
China, last but not least here, on heavy trucks and trailer, we expect 0% to 5% growth this year. First 2 months -- the first month actually started slow, but if you look at February's truck production, it's around 76,000. If you annualize that, you actually end up with 911,000. That would be 10% up from last year's 823,000. So that's pretty good. And we talk about a little more in the -- as I go through the presentation on the build-out that is supposed to happen and happening in Western China, and that certainly will have a positive impact on trucks and trailer also -- demand also in China. 
So next segment, beverage cans and packaging, we continue to expect a global growth of around 2% to 3%. China, Brazil, Middle East, North Africa, Europe continue to lead the growth here. That's all good. One of the world's largest markets, which is North America, very moderately declines, although, and that's also an interesting news to watch, the first 2 months, we had shown an increase of 5.6%. So obviously, it's too early to call it a trend, although we would like to call it a trend, obviously, and love to see it that way. 
So next segment here, commercial building and construction, that's really the odd man around North America and Europe. I'm not telling you any news here. Continues to be under pressure while China and other emerging markets continue to grow. If you add it all up and put it together, you'll see global growth between 2.5% to 3.5%, but it's really 2 worlds that you're seeing there. 
And last but not least, the segment of industrial gas turbine. We expect the market to be up by between 1% to 2%, and this is a combination of new builds to be up, and partially getting offset by the spare parts inventory overhang that exists there. With all else going on in the energy markets, we remain very bullish in the midterm for the industrial gas turbine market. 
To that concludes the end market side, and let's now see how this reflect on the demand for aluminum. Let's have our aluminum demand slide on. Thank you very much. 
So what you're seeing here is pretty much the same picture that I showed you last time. The demand projection hasn't changed much. We've tempered it down by 200,000 tons, which is really nothing in the larger scheme of things, and this is purely coming from Asia. 
On the growth rate side, it doesn't affect the growth rate in -- other than on the third digits. The global demand continues to be around 7%. That's our projection for this year, and we believe that that's pretty accurate; it's going to happen. So you see that if you compare it with what we showed you in the last quarter, you would see that we've taken China and Asia down by 1 percentage point, but it still means we're projecting for China 11% growth, and for Asia without China, 8 percentage points growth. And we also remain confident about the consumption increased patterns that we're seeing in North America, Brazil, India and Russia. So that's all good. 
What does that mean for supply-demand? So let's move to the next chart. On the left-hand side, you see the primary demand-supply situation. And we believe that the -- overall, we continue to see a deficit there. We've, in the usual fashion, broken it down in the table below into China and the rest of the world. And as you can see, this is mainly stemming from China and the rest of the world is essentially balanced. 
If you go to the right-hand side, you see the alumina side, and there's a change that's happening here in the quarter. You saw it also reflected partially in the alumina prices, and Chuck reflected on it in his presentation already. The alumina market has moved into a surplus, particularly in the rest of the world. Once again, I mean, you saw what we announced earlier this week. I mean, we have taken actions here and announced refining curtailments, 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region. This is, by the way, already built in and kind of consummated in the chart that you see down here. So the overhang that we project in the rest of the world in the alumina market is around 1 million tons for this year. 
So let's now focus for a second on the Chinese market. But before we go there, let me remind those that don't follow the Chinese market so strongly what is the structural situation that we see in the Chinese aluminum industry. And here are some hard facts. About 80% of all refineries are in the highest costs compared -- on the global cost curve. That basically means if you chop -- chomp -- chunk it up into quartiles, in the third and fourth quartiles, these are the highest quartiles, right? On the smelters, 87% of all smelters in China are in the highest quartiles, the third and the fourth quartile. 60% of all bauxite, and this is the latest numbers, that China needs for the refinery and the smelting gets imported. 90-plus percent of all smelters and refineries use coal-based energy, so this is obviously one the -- of the factors why you will later that the emission is well above what you see in the industrial norm. And I want to remind you, if you look at our core, we use -- 2/3 of the smelter energy that we use stems from hydropower. 
So if you add this all up, you can already see that this is not a very healthy and not a very competitive industry structure. We believe, and we've talked about that at length many, many times, that currently, with the pricing pressure, about 1/3 of the smelting capacity in China is cash negative. 
So now, what we want to focus on, and let's bring the next slide on, is the new story that's around. The new story is yes, Klaus, this is all going to change because China is moving to the West. And this is all going to change. And with the move to the West, you're going to see a totally different industry. 
So let's take a look what is the truth that we're seeing here. First of all, you see here -- no, no, no, let's go back. We -- there -- we see -- here on the right-hand side, you see what's currently the projections are, how this move is really going to happen, all right? So basically, you see on the right-hand side the projection until 2015 means 10 million tons are supposed to get added here in terms of capacity, right? And you see a breakdown here by the regions. And you saw -- on the left-hand side, you see this -- the graph that shows you where exactly that is. The majority of the expansion, as you see, is on the northwest. And particularly if you break it down here into specific regions, there's really 3 regions that are very strong. It's Xinjang, it's Qinghai and it's Inner Mongolia. And there's reason for it. And the reason is that they're stranded coal, and the stranded coal is going to bring their power costs down. So that's the whole logic. 
What's surprising when you look at it, that there's also build-out in the East, but there's also a very simple explanation for it. This is not going to be greenfield. This is brownfield expansion, and most of those are happening in a province called Shandong, and Shandong has coal reserve. So the same logic pretty much that is behind the move to the West. So that's kind of the factual situation as much as you can project it. 
So let's now take a look at if the scenario were to happen, what exactly would that lead to, right? So -- and that's go to the next slide. All right? This is a complicated slide, so bear with me. It takes me a couple of minutes to go through, and I -- I'll try to be quick but stay with me. So let's start with the left-hand slide. So first, to get this 10 million tons of smelting in place, you will have to build 13 Ma'aden-size smelters, right? In addition, you would also have to build 150 million megawatt hours of power generation. So 17,000 megawatt hours of generating capacity. And even if you assume low Chinese construction costs, it would still add up, and only for smelting and power, not refining, some mining build into that -- that alone would already add up to an investment of $45 billion, right? 
Now you could say ""Well, but there's also positive social impact coming through it."" Granted. And ours -- and so our assessment is this is probably going to bring 100,000 jobs, once this is all built, to the northwestern provinces. But the first calculation is a simple one. You actually already see that this is coming at a price because every job here costs you about $450,000, right? 
So now, look at the slide on the lower left-hand side, right? And that has 2 dimensions. And it's -- it has a dimension on the X axis. On the Y axis, basically, it says if you were to invest in a certain industry RMB 1 million, right, how many jobs would you get for RMB 1 million? On the X axis, it says for the same RMB 1 million, this industry is going to require energy. And the logic is because energy is a scarce resource in China. Now positions the -- different industries in that -- in this grid, right? And the size of the bubble here is the total energy demand. So the bigger total energy demand of this industry. But the demand for RMB 1 million is defined by the scale here on the right-hand side. The blue bubble here is our industry. That's the non-ferrous industry. And what you see here is if you compare that to other industries, the non-ferrous metals industry has a relatively small leverage in terms of job generation, but it's a high leverage in terms of eating up scarce resources, namely energy, right? So you -- that's what you get here, and I'm sure that other people are looking at that. 
So the summary there is, and I'm still with -- assessing the investment here, you get -- you have to put massive investment in there, and I think you would be with me to say, ""Well, you would -- you'll get probably a little bit of, in theory, of social returns."" So that's the first thing you keep in mind. 
So let's go to the middle column here, right? And the middle column talks about the sustainability. And the sustainability -- let's start with the CO2 emissions. 10 million tons and the respective power that would have to be generated mostly done by coal, pretty much all done by coal, that's the logic of moving there, we talked about that, has gone and 142 million tons of CO2. That is twice the amount that -- that this would happen if you just apply industry average, worldwide industry average. That's pretty much driven by using coal and we talked about that before. 
But that's only one perspective. The other fascinating perspective is the aspect of water because you absolutely need quite a bit of water particularly for coal-fired power plants. And the interesting thing is at least I found interesting is that the chart here in the middle, the chart in the middle -- in the middle lower box here plots all provinces in China, and it shows the amount of water in the respective provinces. Color coded in red are those 3 provinces that are, in the main, the ones where the move to the northwest is going. So it is quite surprising to see them on the right-hand side of this chart, meaning that already today, they are not very -- not very beneficially, I mean, pleasantly gifted by having lots of water resources. In fact, I mean it drives the water scarcity aspect further in those provinces because the amount of water that you would need for the 10 million tons per annum is equivalent to the water used at about 1.4 million people would need to live to a year. So that's the second part of things. 
So let's go to the third thing because you'd say, well that [ph] there is probably a big cost advantage, right? Because all of that, I mean, must have a big cost advantage. So look at the right-hand side on the upper chart there, which plots the global cost position, and we broke this down into obviously the 4 quartiles and then we split the bars into what's the northwest and what's in the West basically, right? Now if you add that up, you actually get to the number that I mentioned before that today, 87% of all the smelter capacity in China is in the third or the fourth quartile. Okay, no surprise there. So how is that going to change if you apply the assumption of what we just underlined, right? And say 2015. Well, it's going to get to 80% of the smelting capacity, then being in the third and fourth quartiles. Granted, that's a move, but it comes at a pretty high price, right? 
And one thing you can already take away from that side alone is that, that doesn't look like a threat to the worldwide supply because from there, you -- from that competitive position or lack of competitive position, you will certainly not attack with export. 
So let's summarize these 3 things, at least how I would summarize that. You would need massive investments, you would increase your sustainability issues, granted you have some social returns but I would still call them inferior to what you would get in other industries and you would almost make no improvement on the cost curve. So obviously, it's for China to evaluate whether this is really the right way to move forward, and I think that's exactly what's going to happen. China will evaluate whether this is the right move to go forward. I thought that's important to clarify what is going to happen here and subtract the mystery from the reality, right? 
So let's now move after we've come to this, granted, a little complicated slide, to some more profane things like regional premiums and inventories. So what do we see on the regional premium side here? I mean, the regional premiums are back to -- has risen substantially as you see there in the last quarter, and they are back to historic highs. That's a very good function as you all know by continued strong physical demand and increased interest in financing metal and increased interest in financing metals is a function again of the widening contango and a low interest rate and you know that, that environment is sustaining and in fact has increased if you look at the last quarter. 
So if you then look at the inventory situation, and we again try to put the visible and the so-called invisible inventory together, and you see that this has increased by 500,000 tons from the last quarter. This is almost all China. And the reason for that is a very simple reason, we believe. You saw in the previous slide, the capacity is ramping up, the build is ramping up. At the same time, the first quarter is marked by the lunar year, the change of the lunar year, which typically is the biggest holiday, typically, a lot of end customers are shutting their facilities down, which leads to a disruption of the logistics, which leads to a buildup of the stock and we've seen that year in, year out. So we believe this coming into a time when production ramps up, that's simply what we see here reflected with the 500,000 tons. So this is kind of, in our view, this is going to ripple through. 
You see something else here? I want to mention that. Also no surprise for the connoisseurs of all market, you see the LME canceled warrants are going up. We've talked about that again purely a function of the contango widening and people seeing the longer-term financing being attractive. 
So as the last thing what I'd like to close with, the market discussion with some macro views and some more macroeconomic indicators here. So and that probably comes timely. I'd start with the 10-year bond yields in Europe, and frankly, I mean if there's one thing one can read into that is volatility, looking at what has been happening in the last days. Volatility persists after a time when they come down, you now see them coming up again. 
Volatility persisting there but that's just one indicator. We should be really careful in just getting totally obsessed by one indicator. There's a lot of other indicators that I think have shown good prognostic value. Look at consumer confidence. Consumer confidence improved in all 3 major regions, China, Europe as well as the U.S. And look at the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index. U.S., China, clearly above the 50 mark and improving, Europe still below the 50 mark. You've seen that this had an impact on the first quarter on the commodity prices but the volatility remains and you've seen putting some pressure on pricing in the last couple of updates. 
So with that, let me move over from the markets to how do we see Alcoa and what is Alcoa doing in this environment. And I want to spend a little time -- Chuck has characterized the quarter. Chuck has also given some ideas about how do we see Q2 looking. So let me focus on something that increasingly, people are interested in and cover it for all of you. What do we do on the mid- to long-term basis? And remind you of some of the things that are in place and then you can see how the pieces are fitting together. 
And it has to start with our approach of how we are creating value, our 3 strategic priorities. We are clearly focusing on profitable growth and that's the focus. On cost, growth, innovation and cash, and all of that happening in parallel, and you see it reflected again in this quarter, right? 
Second strategic priority is the Alcoa advantage, using our capabilities in generating, bringing on board, developing talent, technology, customer intimacy, purchasing, operating system, our performance dialogue today the P&L. All of this, we need to be -- and I'm saying it always to our folks, we've got to earn the right to own each one of the businesses everyday. We have to show that we are a better parent than any other one owning this asset. And the only way how you can show it is by consistent superior performance. 
And last but not least, it's the third strategic priority is our disciplined execution. And I think if you reflect the last years, you would be with me to say they have been anything but easy and you seen that again in the last quarter. We do what we say and we do go the extra mile. 
The next slide, this slide here, some of you have seen; and those of you who haven't seen it should be seeing it when you invest in our core because that pretty much tells you what we are doing, right? Because we set -- in end of 2010, we set aggressive midterm targets. And midterm targets are broken down into the 3 segments. Upstream, we said because we said we're going to come down on the cost curve until 2015. 7 percentage points on the refinery cost curve, 10 percentage points on the smelting cost curve. And the first decisions -- the first decisive steps we've taken, I'll talk a little bit more about it. 
On the midstream, we said we can do this until 2013 at $2.5 billion, revenues, incremental revenues and doing all of that by exceeding the historic margin levels. The same on downstream, $1.6 billion incremental revenues exceeding historic margin levels. 
So how exactly are we going to do that? And let me read through each one of those segments so that you understand this is a detailed plan of action that we're executing and that we see as our true north. So let's start with the Alumina segment. You focus on the low -- upper left box because that really tells you how are we going to come down 7 percentage points on the cost curve. It starts with optimizing the portfolio and that's going to give us 2 to 3 percentage points. And go to the right-hand side here. We're restructuring our high-cost assets. This is how you can do it in principle and we're doing it -- you saw the announcement, we are curtailing 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on the refining side.
In addition to that, and in parallel with riding on the cost curve by creeping production at our lower cost facilities, like Wagerup and Pinjarra in the Western Australia, last year, record production, great profitability up 23% and all of that was no extra capital. That's the best thing that you can get, right? So that's one thing. 2% to 3% coming from that move. The next thing is moving to less-expensive energy, like [indiscernible] where we are moving over to gas. That's one percentage point down the cost curve. Saudi Arabia is going to give us 2 percentage points and then productivity is going to give us 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Then in addition to that, kind of the cream on top is when we introduce the alumina pricing index, aligning the prices more to market fundamentals. Today, we have 33% of all customers on EPI hotspot and we are actually promised we're going to increase that over the years as the opportunities come up.
So second thing is aluminum now. Same logic, left upper box shows you how we're going to drive down 10 percentage points on the cost curve. Starts again with the portfolio, right? On the right-hand side, you see what we're doing and here again, you see the announcement of 530,000 tons that we took up and you saw -- you see here, we've basically been using every single one of the levers that you can use when you restructured the high cost asset, we will continue to do that and always have in mind what are the cash implications of that, right? 
The second thing that we're go to do is do also here on restructuring the portfolio is looking at monetization, looking at opportunities to lower the cost curve with good assets. So one of the examples is our Canadian system, become more, we have reached an agreement to repower our Quebec smelters basically reaching until 2040. And the Massena East is another opportunity. There's an existing modernization portfolio which would include a 30 to 40 years of competitive power cost. That alone is going to bring us down 2% to 3% down the cost curve, the monetization part. Then comes Saudi Arabia -- no, no, just go back. Another 2 percentage points on the cost curve. And then productivity, 1 to 2 percentage points on the cost curve. 
The upside here, comparable to API on the revenue side on the value-add side is our casthouse. Basically, optimizing, optimizing the product mix and using the value-add creation more. Last year, we increased the way -- we professionalized the way we're using that and you can see it in the result, we got $262 million more margins purely from the casthouse, purely from that optimization. 
Next slide. Talking about Saudi Arabia, I mentioned it twice already, and here is an update on our growth project in Saudi Arabia. The pictures show the current status. Actually, that's a week old probably. You can see the line, the carbon plan, the liquid pitch tanks, the hot reversing mills. As you know, there are 2 phases, one is coming online in 2013 and the other one in 2014. I think the picture tell you at least one story, it's on time. I tell you another story, it's on budget. And both things come well together, right? So this is a great, great example of the Alcoa advantage. I mean, it's an integrated facility, mining, refining, smelting to rolling. And really, this is only profitable through the Alcoa expertise and our reputation and our financial strength. 
Let's move on to the next segment. So told you the story how we're moving down the upstream business on the cost curve. Next one is how we're going to build out the global gold products [ph]. And here, there's $2.5 billion and higher profitability. Now the great news is 55% of the $2.5 billion incremental revenues have been reached in the first year, that's pretty cool, right? 
So the other thing that's equally outstanding is the profitability that we see in the first quarter. I mean, look at that, $430 per EBITDA per metric ton, the 10-year average is at $235, right? And you see, I mean, how that sticks out. It's really an outstanding performance. So let's look a little closer at how GRP is going to get to those targets. 
So it starts but it doesn't end with aerospace. Here are the major platforms in aerospace. You see the build rates there and you actually do see that the build rates overall by 2013 have increased by 27%, that's pretty substantial. The good news is we are in pretty much every one of those and many more platforms but those are the big platforms. And that's an excellent position that we have. In addition, the decision last year of Airbus and Boeing to have the A320 and the B737 as all aluminum planes and use them with innovative aluminum lithium obviously adds to it. This all provides a great platform for revenue as well as margin growth, GRPs, I mean our global gold business revenues, we believe, we can increase in this segment alone by 22% by 2013. 
As I said, this is not the only great segment to be in, packaging is another one. We have growth in there that varies between 4% to 20%. 20% is probably rather on the high side in China, that is. We are leading in some core regions. We are expanding like an Saudi Arabia. And there's innovation, you see it on the left hand side aluminum bottles, shake cans, great innovations in that field. Same thing holds true for automotive North America. Growth with 34%, we've talked about that before but it's worth reminding everybody. Fuel efficiency standard. [indiscernible] other big driver. Light weighting is the name of the game. We are putting money behind. We are expanding them for $300 million. Most of the capacity that we are building is already committed. And the good news also is all of that would not be possible if we wouldn't have process innovations, so making the -- working with aluminum and other materials easier in the manufacturing process. Bringing the barriers to change from steel to aluminum down substantially. 
Last segment I want to talk about here is Consumer Electronics. Growth rate [ph] that we see here is 18% and the only thing I want to say is we are aluminizing also this end market. So besides from the key capabilities of our materials like lightweight, strength, probability. Many customers today are focusing more and more on sustainability and they are seeing it as a gigantic advantage. They have a material that truly is infinitely recyclable, and that drives the statistic of 75% of all aluminum ever produced in history on this planet still being in used. 
So how is that all going to work? Well, there's another cream on top of it and our Global Rolled Products business and this is our increased presence in the emerging markets like Russia and China. That's nice. In Russia, we have established ourself already as a key domestic supplier in some of the markets like packaging, aero and commercial and transportation. Nice performance last year on the profit side as well as on the growth side and we're working continuously also on new applications. 
So Russia, we are already nicely established. In China, we are establishing ourself. We have reached a positive EBITDA last year. We have a great joint venture partner that we will work with even more so in the midstream segment here with China Power Investment Corporation, signed a joint venture agreement focusing particularly on the growth in this segment. And we also see that there are growing segments, we're growing in the seed. We are starting to become a reliable supplier for the automotive sector, and we are growing into the Consumer Electronics market.
So that's how GRP is going to do. Last but not least, let's talk about Engineered Products and Solutions. This is a great success story and they are on growth path for the 2013 target. Starts with the growth, they achieved 44% of the growth target of $1.6 billion in the first year after announcement. And guess what, they achieved that and also this quarter, another record performance, 19% margin, the highest ever quarter. So EPS continues of course to grow at margins above historic levels. 
So and if you haven't noticed that yet, I mean, EPS this quarter is contributing more than 50% to our core profits. So if you look at the -- out of this $1.6 billion of growth, $600 million are coming from the market and it's really important to understand what is our market position here? Let's start again with aerospace. You see this is the product in aerospace. Pretty much all of them in a #1 or #2 position and this represents 47% of all revenues, and the market is growing 13% to 14%. That alone is already wonderful position to be in. 
You go to heavy trucks and trailer. Again, we are in the lead that we are in fact North America. #1 position, clearly #1, represents 16% of the total revenue basis. North America growing 7% to 12%, wonderful. Airfoils, clear #1 position, represent 10% and it's a gross margin of 1% to 2% this year. But as I said early on, I'm very, very convinced that this market has a very strong future going forward. The only outlier in the way is the nonresidential construction market, not because we don't have a great position in there, we do have a great position there, in the U.S. particularly, but because it's currently not growing but I'll also that I believe one day will change. 
So let's talk about the other part, the other $1 billion. I mean, $600 million, I talked about here in the market, the $1 billion comes to innovation, right? And innovation is pretty much the middle name of our Engineered Products and Solutions business. And here, you see on this slide quite a number of examples. I don't have the time to go through all of them but I'll pick one out, just that you get a feel for the value that we're bringing. I'll pick out the next-generation engine airfoils. And just keep in mind, the jet engine OEMs are now announcing their next-generation jet engine. 
And here are some statistics. 15%, reduced fuel consumption, 50% percent reduced emissions, 30% improved maintenance cycle. 15% percent noise reduction. The airfoils are critically enabler for that. Things like our advanced cooling schemes via the 3D platform core technologies are a substantial driver for better cooling and that allows a higher temperature in the burn chamber. The high-grade and single twisting technology alone allows us to increase the melting point up to 12%. And thin trading etch technology brings the weight down by 20%. I think you get a feel for how substantial these type of technologies and these type of offerings are driving the value for our customers. That's why I'm really optimistic how we are going to reach this $1.6 billion. 
And last but not least, there's also the aspect of organic growth that I want to point out, we will continue to look for acquisitions. We've done that in the last year very successfully. You see here on the left hand side, from Fairchild, republic fund [indiscernible] fasteners, all of these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, increase our share and grow our profitability, and we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our portfolio and also to create value to our shareholders. 
Let's come to an end here. We had a strong start in 2012. We're delivering our promises. The markets are stabilizing. We're executing on our strategy. We're delivering results. Our upstream business moving down the cost curve and deliver strong productivity gains. Our midstream record profitability, good growth. Our downstream Engineered Products and Solutions record profitability, good growth. Cash management, outstanding, chuck referred to it. And all of that works with leveraging all our core advantage from talent to technology, so we're well-prepared for the future whatever it will bring but the near future is now to open the lines to you all to ask questions and us to give answers. So thank you very much."

Welcome, everyone, and thanks for taking the time and joining us today. Look, before we dive into the slides, I'd just like to make a few introductory comments, if I could. And we think we started the year with an excellent first quart",2577,"Yes, thanks, Kelly. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for taking the time and joining us today. Look, before we dive into the slides, I'd just like to make a few introductory comments, if I could. And we think we started the year with an excellent first quarter, and I say that from both an earnings perspective as well as a cash perspective. On the earnings front, as we go through this, it will become evident, but our business performance was outstanding in that all of the businesses generated significant productivity. And on the cash side where we experienced the usual first quarter use of funds, we set a first quarter record on days working capital, and we funded 1/3 of this year's pension contributions in cash. And lastly, as you'll see from both mine and Klaus' presentations, we're making meaningful progress on our strategic 3- and 5-year targets. 
So with that said, let's dive into the slides. First, a financial overview. Our income from continuing operations of $94 million was $0.09 a share. If you exclude the impact of restructuring and other special items, that bumps that up to $105 million or $0.10 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $624 million. That's up 40% sequentially. We had a free cash flow of negative $506 million, and as I alluded to, we had certain payments that are made in the first quarter that are annual or semiannual payments. We also had pension contributions of over $200 million in that number, and we had a working capital use of funds, albeit, as you can see on the next bullet point, that was a days low record in the first quarter at 32 days. 
Our debt-to-cap was at 35.6%, which is a slight increase over the fourth quarter, yet our cash on hand remains at $1.7 billion. Lastly, we set several records in both our midstream and downstream businesses, and I'll highlight those for you right now. 
In our Global Rolled Products segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $96 million. We had EBITDA per metric ton, which is our margin measure in this business, at $430 a metric ton, which was an all-time high. And the days working capital in this business was down 3 days year-over-year for a record first quarter of 42 days. 
If we move to the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had a record first quarter ATOI of $155 million. We achieved our quarterly EBITDA margins of 19.2%, and that, too, was an all-time high. And we lowered days working capital 4 days to another first quarter low. One other point to mention in Engineered Products and Solutions is that ATOI now represents 52% of our total segment ATOI. 
Let's move on to the income statement. Okay, there's 3 items I'd really like to hit on the income statement before moving on, and the first has to do with revenue. Revenue was up slightly, both sequentially and year-over-year as you can see. On a sequential basis, we had alumina pricing down 8%, but that was more than overcome by primary prices being up 2%. And aerospace revenue, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation all showing increases, with automotive, industrial and commercial transportation up double digits. 
On a year-over-year basis, alumina pricing was down 13%, primary pricing was down 9%, aerospace, automotive, industrial and commercial transportation here again were up. If you go to COGS as a percent of sales, you can see that it's an improvement, or down 240 basis points on a sequential basis, and that's all attributed to volume, productivity and product mix. 
And lastly, the effective tax rate for the quarter stood at 28.3%. And if we're looking at an annual rate right now, it would be right at 27.5% would be our expectation for the full year. So that gave us a $0.09 a share before special items. 
Let's move on to the next slide and we'll check out the special items. We really only had 2 this quarter, and they were fairly immaterial. We had additional severance costs related to the Spanish curtailments, and that was $7 million, and then we had $4 million of non-cash mark-to-markets. So the total of those 2 were special items of $11 million, and they took our $94 million income from ops up to $105 million, which is the $0.10 a share. 
Let's move on now to the sequential bridge. And this sequential bridge pretty much tells the story from an earnings perspective, in looking at the green here in what our businesses were able to achieve. In fact, we went from a loss of $34 million before special items in the fourth quarter to a profit of $105 million. So that's up $139 million sequentially. 
If you looked at the LME on net of FX, it's giving us $17 million improvement in the quarter as we saw a rise in aluminum prices partially offset by lower alumina prices. Volume, price, mix and productivity contributed $171 million in profit, and that offset the cost, obviously, of $49 million, $20 million of which related to pensions. 
The higher volumes generated profits of $29 million, 2/3 of that coming from Global Rolled Products and 1/3 from Engineered Products and Solutions. Our price and mix also contributed $34 million, and that was driven by a higher mix of value-added products in our Primary business and improved mix of Global Rolled Products. 
We had prevailing cost headwinds that I alluded to, pension, cost increases, raw materials and energy, which were strongly offset by the productivity improvements. And just to give you a glimpse of the type of productivity improvements that we saw this quarter, they range from higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, scrap recovery and usage reductions. It's just a significant effort from all of our businesses and, obviously, the key factor in our earnings improvement. 
Now let's move on to the Alumina segment. The Alumina segment was actually the only segment with a sequential decrease in ATOI and went from $125 million to $35 million. Third-party revenue was down $775 million, or 8.5% sequentially, and that's on a lower realized alumina prices. And there we saw LME-linked alumina prices go down almost 5%, whereas API spot prices went down over 9%. So the API -- the ATOI change really, you could break up into a few different pieces. You've got the market's impact from the pricing and also, the A dollar strengthening about 5% against the U.S. dollar. You've got the onetime land sale that took place in the fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter. So that was an impact of $30 million. And then you got a productivity that's offsetting the cost increases, the $24 million of productivity more than offsetting the $11 million in cost increases. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we see -- the beginning of the quarter, the alumina surplus is continuing to be a drag on API and spot prices. And obviously, that has a lot to do with us recently announcing curtailments of 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on alumina, and the production in the second quarter will be down as a result of that by 100,000 tons. We have -- we're going to incur maintenance expenses, some of which was just a timing between the first and has moved to the second quarter, which will impact us by a negative $10 million in the second quarter, yet we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Let's now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue in the Primary segment was $1,009,000,000, and that's down 2.4% and really is comprised of 2 components. Our realized prices are actually up 2% sequentially, but our third-party shipments are down 4.2% as we shipped more product internally. We had ATOI of $10 million, and that's an increase from a loss of $32 million in the fourth quarter. The market, as you can see, the net of pricing and FX, the currency netted us an improvement of $25 million obviously on the higher LME prices. Yet, we also showed an improvement on product mix as our value-added products, particularly in North America, provided us with $10 million. So our strong productivity gains came from process improvements, and they generated $23 million. So if you were to take the productivity improvements and our mix improvements of $33 million, they will more than double the cost increases of $16 million that we incurred. 
As we look forward to the second quarter, we expect production to be down 25,000 tons due to the Spanish curtailments. We anticipate that we're going to start to see some of the benefit from lower raw material prices and that will impact us by a positive $10 million. We have some planned maintenance activities at both our Rockdale and Warrick power facilities, which will negatively impact us by $10 million. And the recent fire at the Massena facility in the Primary segment, we expect that, that will impact us somewhere between $9 million and $11 million. And as always, we expect our productivity gains to continue. 
Now I'd like to move to the Global Rolled Products segment. The third-party shipments in the Global Rolled Products group were up 45,000 tons or 11.1%, and that had a lot to do with the revenue going up to almost $1.9 billion or $159 million improvement or 9.2%. Strong end markets or driving the higher revenue were automotive, commercial transportation and packaging, all growing double digits over prior year -- over prior quarter, excuse me, with aerospace also seeing a sequential improvement. 
ATOI of $96 million for the quarter was up 269% sequentially, and you can see the 3 major benefits to us. We had $70 million of improved profitability coming from volume, price/mix and productivity. The $20 million in higher volumes are driving higher capacity utilizations in North America, Europe and Australia. We've got $25 million of favorable price/mix, and then $25 million coming from productivity, which really was derived from UBC utilization, which is scrap utilization for us, used beverage containers, energy efficiency, sheet recovery and lower supply usage. 
Just to mention again, I think it's worthwhile mentioning again, this segment had outstanding results when you look at the records that they set: record first quarter ATOI, record all-time EBITDA per metric ton and record first quarter days working capital. 
As we look to the second quarter, we see seasonal increases in packaging demand. We also anticipate improvements in Russia and China with higher volumes and improved mix. Obviously, we think that productivity will continue, but European markets remain uncertain. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions. Third-party revenue in Engineered Products and Solutions was $1.4 billion, and that's up 3% sequentially but 11% year-over-year. ATOI was $155 million, which is a 27% increase over the fourth quarter. I'll mention again that this segment now represents 52% of our total segment's ATOI. 
The improved profitability is really coming from 3 main areas: increased revenue in aerospace, automotive and commercial wheels led to a volume improvement of $10 million; we had $4 million positive impact from price/mix; and we also had $21 million in productivity improvements, driven by process improvements, particularly scrap and labor utilizations and procurement savings. Here again, records on all-time EBITDA margin of 19.2%, record first quarter ATOI and record days working capital. Excuse me.
As we look to the second quarter, we're going to have an impact from the Massena fire, between $8 million and $12 million. European building and construction market's going to be down quarter-over-quarter, but we think share gains and productivity will continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flow statement. We had cash from operations of a negative $236 million, and leading -- that led us to a negative free cash flow of $506 million. I had mentioned earlier we had pension contributions of $213 million, which was all cash. We estimate that will be about 1/3 of our pension contributions this year. In the taxes and other adjustments line of $202 million, we have some annual and semiannual payments that take place in that category, both interest payments and variable compensation. And then we had a use of working capital of $289 million, which I'll go through in just a minute. 
The debt-to-cap stood at 35.6%, and we ended with cash on hand of $1.7 billion. I mentioned earlier the days working capital were a 7-day improvement and set a record for the first quarter. That would take us to the next slide. 
Okay, on the next slide. Really, this chart is truly a great accomplishment, and it exhibits what our operations have been able to achieve, not only a consistent but a sustainable basis. Let me draw your attention to a few things. I've already mentioned the 7 days, and that's between the first quarter of '11 and the first quarter of '12. This set an all-time record. That 7 days at today's level of working capital would be worth about $0.5 billion of cash. But go back to the first quarter of '09 as we were coming into grips with the recession that was taking place and dealing with the drop-off in volumes and where we come from then. You're talking about a 23-day improvement. And at today's level, that would be worth about $1.5 billion of working capital. In fact, we had 10 quarters in a row of sustained year-over-year improvement in working capital, and the company is poised to continue this record. 
Now let's move on to the last slide where I hopefully can summarize what's been going on. If you look at the left-hand side, you would see under Executing Our Strategy what our midterm strategic priorities and targets are. And in the upstream segment, it's coming down 7 points on the refining cost curve and 10 points on the smelting cost curve. And you can easily understand the significant value that would generate as we act on that. In fact, we have been acting on that. We're looking to either fix, close or curtail facilities. You've seen our actions around that. We generated strong productivity gains in both of those segments, more than offsetting any cost increases, and we're obviously committed to hold those. And we're on growth -- we're on target on our growth projects. 
If you look to the midstream and downstream, you're looking at revenue generation growth of $2.5 billion in Global Rolled Products and $1.6 billion in Engineered Products and Solutions. You're seeing where we -- what we had accomplished through 2011, where we had accomplished 55% of that and 44% of that, respectively, in those 2 segments, and we've grown on top of that this year as we've begun the year and at historical levels. So all 4 of these, we think, are significant value generators that we're committed to as we go through the remaining 2 and 4 years of these targets. 
But we also understand that we're managing this year for cash, and we're driving towards positive free cash flow. We're still committed to achieving that this year. As I told you earlier, we're trying to fund our pension plan with cash and not use equity as well, and we're dedicated to doing that and have a great start to this year in accomplishing those targets as well. 
So with that being said, I'll now turn it over to Klaus."

Let's waste no time, get right straight into the overview on our end markets. And then after going through the markets, we'll focus on what we are doing in our core. So let's",6272,"Well, thank you very much, Chuck, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Let's waste no time, get right straight into the overview on our end markets. And then after going through the markets, we'll focus on what we are doing in our core. 
So let's start with this. So in summary, when you look at the chart, you see we pretty much see growth in all global end markets. North America has strength, and the only exception really is building and construction. China had growth across all segments, a little softer but still good, good growth. Europe, hovering along, I would call that. And on aerospace, the market goes from strength really to strength. 
Let's start with aerospace. I mean, we have increased our growth projection by 3 percentage points to 13% to 14% growth this year. This is mainly driven by a stronger performance of the segment of large commercial aircraft, which now has a combined backlog, Boeing and Airbus that is, of over 8,400 aircraft. So that's the equivalent of more than 8 years. But we also see, and that's new this quarter, that the business jet segment is coming back. We expect a growth of around 8%. However, this -- the growth from business jet was pretty much offset by the anticipated decline in the military output. 
Automotive, the next segment, with the exception of Europe, the automotive market is really a positive story. North America, strong, and China continues to grow. So we expect 2% to 7% growth on a worldwide basis. 
Let's stay for a moment with North America. We have increased our forecast by 2 percentage points, so 7% to 12% for 2012. The year started strong, well, the first time since March 2008 that the seasonally adjusted selling rate topped 50 million vehicles in February. The run rate is not quite exactly there at the 14.5 million vehicles for the first 3 months. This is really still driven by the unusually high average fleet rate -- fleet age, 10.6 years today versus the 10-year average of 9.4 years. 
Another positive sign, by the way, is that the vehicle incentives are down around 15% versus the first 2 months in 2011. And another good news here that shows the strength in America will most likely continue, the inventories are below historic norms in March, 57 days. The historic norm is around 60 to 65 days. Good news. 
Europe automotive in EU27, sales are down around 8.3% compared to last year. We believe production is going to decline this year around 4% to 9% compared to last year. 
China automotive, China -- the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers has recently stated that their forecast growth of 8% in 2012 will most likely not be met. The year has started out slow. The sales were down 6% year-over-year. But we believe China in general continues to grow well, and we expect 2% to 7% growth in the automotive market in China this year. 
Let's move on to next segment, heavy trucks and trailer. Globally, we expect 1% to 5% growth with strong differences across major regions. So let's start with North America. Truck production continues to grow. We've seen the first 2 months' production is up by 65% versus last year, 51,200 versus 31,000 last year. The backlog remains healthy at historic norms at around 121,000 vehicles, and net orders recently are a little lower through March, minus 16%, 67,600 versus 80,500. But the 3 months' running average remains robust at around 270,000 annualized, so we project the growth in North America between 7% and 12%. 
Europe 27, truck registrations are down by 2.5%. We expect a 3% to 8% production decline, and this is a combination of 2 factors of the domestic demand reduction as well as the dampening effect by the export demand. Export demand is declining, but declining not toward the same rate than the internal EU27 demand. 
China, last but not least here, on heavy trucks and trailer, we expect 0% to 5% growth this year. First 2 months -- the first month actually started slow, but if you look at February's truck production, it's around 76,000. If you annualize that, you actually end up with 911,000. That would be 10% up from last year's 823,000. So that's pretty good. And we talk about a little more in the -- as I go through the presentation on the build-out that is supposed to happen and happening in Western China, and that certainly will have a positive impact on trucks and trailer also -- demand also in China. 
So next segment, beverage cans and packaging, we continue to expect a global growth of around 2% to 3%. China, Brazil, Middle East, North Africa, Europe continue to lead the growth here. That's all good. One of the world's largest markets, which is North America, very moderately declines, although, and that's also an interesting news to watch, the first 2 months, we had shown an increase of 5.6%. So obviously, it's too early to call it a trend, although we would like to call it a trend, obviously, and love to see it that way. 
So next segment here, commercial building and construction, that's really the odd man around North America and Europe. I'm not telling you any news here. Continues to be under pressure while China and other emerging markets continue to grow. If you add it all up and put it together, you'll see global growth between 2.5% to 3.5%, but it's really 2 worlds that you're seeing there. 
And last but not least, the segment of industrial gas turbine. We expect the market to be up by between 1% to 2%, and this is a combination of new builds to be up, and partially getting offset by the spare parts inventory overhang that exists there. With all else going on in the energy markets, we remain very bullish in the midterm for the industrial gas turbine market. 
To that concludes the end market side, and let's now see how this reflects on the demand for aluminum. Let's have our aluminum demand slide on. Thank you very much. 
So what you're seeing here is pretty much the same picture that I showed you last time. The demand projection hasn't changed much. We've tempered it down by 200,000 tons, which is really nothing in the larger scheme of things, and this is purely coming from Asia. 
On the growth rate side, it doesn't affect the growth rate in -- other than on the third digits. The global demand continues to be around 7%. That's our projection for this year, and we believe that, that's pretty accurate; it's going to happen. So you see that if you compare it with what we showed you in the last quarter, you would see that we've taken China and Asia down by 1 percentage point, but it still means we're projecting for China 11% growth, and for Asia without China, 8 percentage points growth. And we also remain confident about the consumption increased patterns that we're seeing in North America, Brazil, India and Russia. So that's all good. 
What does that mean for supply-demand? So let's move to the next chart. On the left-hand side, you see the primary demand-supply situation. And we believe that the -- overall, we continue to see a deficit there. We've, in the usual fashion, broken it down in the table below into China and the rest of the world. And as you can see, this is mainly stemming from China and the rest of the world is essentially balanced. 
If you go to the right-hand side, you see the alumina side, and there's a change that's happening here in the quarter. You saw it also reflected partially in the alumina prices, and Chuck reflected on it in his presentation already. The alumina market has moved into a surplus, particularly in the rest of the world. Once again, I mean, you saw what we announced earlier this week. I mean, we have taken actions here and announced refining curtailments, 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region. This is, by the way, already built in and kind of consummated in the chart that you see down here. So the overhang that we project in the rest of the world in the alumina market is around 1 million tons for this year. 
So let's now focus for a second on the Chinese market. But before we go there, let me remind those that don't follow the Chinese market so strongly what is the structural situation that we see in the Chinese aluminum industry. And here are some hard facts. About 80% of all refineries are in the highest costs compared -- on the global cost curve. That basically means if you chop -- chomp -- chunk it up into quartiles, in the third and fourth quartiles, these are the highest quartiles, right? On the smelters, 87% of all smelters in China are in the highest quartiles, the third and the fourth quartile. 60% of all bauxite, and this is the latest numbers, that China needs for the refinery and the smelting gets imported. 90-plus percent of all smelters and refineries use coal-based energy, so this is obviously one the -- of the factors why you will see later that the emission is well above what you see in the industrial norm. And I want to remind you, if you look at our core, we use -- 2/3 of the smelter energy that we use stems from hydropower. 
So if you add this all up, you can already see that this is not a very healthy and not a very competitive industry structure. We believe, and we've talked about that at length many, many times, that currently, with the pricing pressure, about 1/3 of the smelting capacity in China is cash negative. 
So now, what we want to focus on, and let's bring the next slide on, is the new story that's around. The new story is yes, Klaus, this is all going to change because China is moving to the West. And this is all going to change. And with the move to the West, you're going to see a totally different industry. 
So let's take a look what is the truth that we're seeing here. First of all, you see here -- no, no, no, let's go back. We -- there -- we see -- here on the right-hand side, you see what's currently the projections are, how this move is really going to happen, all right? So basically, you see on the right-hand side the projection until 2015 means 10 million tons are supposed to get added here in terms of capacity, right? And you see a breakdown here by the regions. And you saw -- on the left-hand side, you see this -- the graph that shows you where exactly that is. The majority of the expansion, as you see, is on the northwest. And particularly if you break it down here into specific regions, there's really 3 regions that are very strong. It's Xinjang, it's Qinghai and it's Inner Mongolia. And there's reason for it. And the reason is that they're stranded coal, and the stranded coal is going to bring their power costs down. So that's the whole logic. 
What's surprising when you look at it, that there's also build-out in the East, but there's also a very simple explanation for it. This is not going to be greenfield. This is brownfield expansion, and most of those are happening in a province called Shandong, and Shandong has coal reserve. So the same logic pretty much that is behind the move to the West. So that's kind of the factual situation as much as you can project it. 
So let's now take a look at if the scenario were to happen, what exactly would that lead to, right? So -- and that's go to the next slide. All right? This is a complicated slide, so bear with me. It takes me a couple of minutes to go through, and I -- I'll try to be quick, but stay with me. So let's start with the left-hand slide. So first, to get this 10 million tons of smelting in place, you will have to build 13 Ma'aden-size smelters, right? In addition, you would also have to build 150 million megawatt hours of power generation. So 17,000 megawatt hours of generating capacity. And even if you assume low Chinese construction costs, it would still add up, and only for smelting and power, not refining, some mining built into that -- that alone would already add up to an investment of $45 billion, right? 
Now you could say ""Well, but there's also positive social impact coming through it."" Granted. And ours -- and so our assessment is this is probably going to bring 100,000 jobs, once this is all built, to the northwestern provinces. But the first calculation is a simple one. You actually already see that this is coming at a price because every job here costs you about $450,000, right? 
So now, look at the slide on the lower left-hand side, right? And that has 2 dimensions. And it's -- it has a dimension on the X axis. On the Y axis, basically, it says if you were to invest in a certain industry RMB 1 million, right, how many jobs would you get for RMB 1 million? On the X axis, it says for the same RMB 1 million, this industry is going to require energy. And the logic is because energy is a scarce resource in China. Now positions the -- different industries in that -- in this grid, right? And the size of the bubble here is the total energy demand. So the bigger total energy demand of this industry. But the demand for RMB 1 million is defined by the scale here on the right-hand side. The blue bubble here is our industry. That's the non-ferrous industry. And what you see here is if you compare that to other industries, the non-ferrous metals industry has a relatively small leverage in terms of job generation, but it's a high leverage in terms of eating up scarce resources, namely energy, right? So you -- that's what you get here, and I'm sure that other people are looking at that. 
So the summary there is, and I'm still with -- assessing the investment here, you get -- you have to put massive investment in there, and I think you would be with me to say, ""Well, you would -- you'll get probably a little bit of, in theory, of social returns."" So that's the first thing you keep in mind. 
So let's go to the middle column here, right? And the middle column talks about the sustainability. And the sustainability -- let's start with the CO2 emissions. 10 million tons and the respective power that would have to be generated mostly done by coal, pretty much all done by coal, that's the logic of moving there, we talked about that, has gone and emit 142 million tons of CO2. That is twice the amount that -- that this would happen if you just apply industry average, worldwide industry average. That's pretty much driven by using coal and we talked about that before. 
But that's only one perspective. The other fascinating perspective is the aspect of water because you absolutely need quite a bit of water particularly for coal-fired power plants. And the interesting thing is, at least I found interesting, is that the chart here in the middle, the chart in the middle -- in the middle lower box here plots all provinces in China, and it shows the amount of water in the respective provinces. Color coded in red are those 3 provinces that are, in the main, the ones where the move to the northwest is going. So it is quite surprising to see them on the right-hand side of this chart, meaning that already today, they are not very -- not very beneficially, I mean, pleasantly gifted by having lots of water resources. In fact, I mean it drives the water scarcity aspect further in those provinces because the amount of water that you would need for the 10 million tons per annum is equivalent to the water used at about 1.4 million people would need to live to a year. So that's the second part of things. 
So let's go to the third thing because you'd say, well, but there is probably a big cost advantage, right? Because all of that, I mean, must have a big cost advantage. So look at the right-hand side on the upper chart there, which plots the global cost position, and we broke this down into obviously the 4 quartiles and then we split the bars into what's the northwest and what's in the rest basically, right? Now if you add that up, you actually get to the number that I mentioned before that today, 87% of all the smelter capacity in China is in the third or the fourth quartile. Okay, no surprise there. So how is that going to change if you apply the assumption of what we just underlined, right? And say 2015. Well, it's going to get to 80% of the smelting capacity, then being in the third and fourth quartiles. Granted, that's a move, but it comes at a pretty high price, right? 
And one thing you can already take away from that side alone is that, that doesn't look like a threat to the worldwide supply because from there, you -- from that competitive position or lack of competitive position, you will certainly not attack with export. 
So let's summarize these 3 things, at least how I would summarize that. You would need massive investments, you would increase your sustainability issues, granted you have some social returns but I would still call them inferior to what you would get in other industries and you would almost make no improvement on the cost curve. So obviously, it's for China to evaluate whether this is really the right way to move forward, and I think that's exactly what's going to happen. China will evaluate whether this is the right move to go forward. I thought that's important to clarify what is going to happen here and subtract the mystery from the reality, right? 
So let's now move after we've come to this, granted, a little complicated slide, to some more profane things like regional premiums and inventories. So what do we see on the regional premium side here? I mean, the regional premiums are back to -- has risen substantially as you see there in the last quarter, and they are back to historic highs. That's a very good function as you all know by continued strong physical demand and increased interest in financing metal and increased interest in financing metals is a function again of the widening contango and a low interest rate and you know that, that environment is sustaining and in fact has increased if you look at the last quarter. 
So if you then look at the inventory situation, and we again try to put the visible and the so-called invisible inventory together, and you see that this has increased by 500,000 tons from the last quarter. This is almost all China. And the reason for that is a very simple reason, we believe. You saw in the previous slide, the capacity is ramping up, the build is ramping up. At the same time, the first quarter is marked by the lunar year, the change of the lunar year, which typically is the biggest holiday, typically, a lot of end customers are shutting their facilities down, which leads to a disruption of the logistics, which leads to a buildup of the stock and we've seen that year in, year out. So we believe this coming into a time when production ramps up, that's simply what we see here reflected with the 500,000 tons. So this is kind of, in our view, this is going to ripple through. 
You see something else here? I want to mention that. Also no surprise for the connoisseurs of our market, you see the LME canceled warrants are going up. We've talked about that again purely a function of the contango widening and people seeing the longer-term financing being attractive. 
So as the last thing what I'd like to close with, the market discussion with some macro views and some more macroeconomic indicators here. So and that probably comes timely. I'd start with the 10-year bond yields in Europe, and frankly, I mean if there's one thing one can read into that is volatility, looking at what has been happening in the last days. Volatility persists after a time when they come down, you now see them coming up again. 
Volatility persisting there, but that's just one indicator. We should be really careful in just getting totally obsessed by one indicator. There's a lot of other indicators that I think have shown good prognostic value. Look at consumer confidence. Consumer confidence improved in all 3 major regions, China, Europe as well as the U.S. And look at the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index. U.S., China, clearly above the 50 mark and improving, Europe still below the 50 mark. You've seen that this had an impact on the first quarter on the commodity prices, but the volatility remains and you've seen putting some pressure on pricing in the last couple of updates. 
So with that, let me move over from the markets to how do we see Alcoa and what is Alcoa doing in this environment. And I want to spend a little time -- Chuck has characterized the quarter. Chuck has also given some ideas about how do we see Q2 looking. So let me focus on something that increasingly, people are interested in and cover it for all of you. What do we do on the mid- to long-term basis? And remind you of some of the things that are in place and then you can see how the pieces are fitting together. 
And it has to start with our approach of how we are creating value, our 3 strategic priorities. We are clearly focusing on profitable growth and that's the focus. On cost, growth, innovation and cash, and all of that happening in parallel, and you see it reflected again in this quarter, right? 
Second strategic priority is the Alcoa advantage, using our capabilities in generating, bringing on board, developing talent, technology, customer intimacy, purchasing, operating system, our performance dialogue to daily P&L. All of this, we need to be -- and I'm saying it always to our folks, we've got to earn the right to own each one of the businesses everyday. We have to show that we are a better parent than any other one owning this asset. And the only way how you can show it is by consistent superior performance. 
And last but not least, it's the third strategic priority is our disciplined execution. And I think if you reflect the last years, you would be with me to say they have been anything but easy and you seen that again in the last quarter. We do what we say and we do go the extra mile. 
The next slide, this slide here, some of you have seen; and those of you who haven't seen it should be seeing it when you invest in our core because that pretty much tells you what we are doing, right? Because we set -- in end of 2010, we set aggressive midterm targets. And midterm targets are broken down into the 3 segments. Upstream, we said because we said we're going to come down on the cost curve until 2015. 7 percentage points on the refinery cost curve, 10 percentage points on the smelting cost curve. And the first decisions -- the first decisive steps we've taken, I'll talk a little bit more about it. 
On the midstream, we said we can do this until 2013 at $2.5 billion, revenues, incremental revenues and doing all of that by exceeding the historic margin levels. The same on downstream, $1.6 billion incremental revenues exceeding historic margin levels. 
So how exactly are we going to do that? And let me read through each one of those segments so that you understand this is a detailed plan of action that we're executing and that we see as our true north. So let's start with the Alumina segment. You focus on the low -- upper left box because that really tells you how are we going to come down 7 percentage points on the cost curve. It starts with optimizing the portfolio and that's going to give us 2 to 3 percentage points. And go to the right-hand side here. We're restructuring our high-cost assets. This is how you can do it in principle and we're doing it -- you saw the announcement, we are curtailing 390,000 tons in the Atlantic region on the refining side.
In addition to that, and in parallel with driving down the cost curve by creeping production at our lower cost facilities, like Wagerup and Pinjarra in the Western Australia, last year, record production, great profitability up 23% and all of that was no extra capital. That's the best thing that you can get, right? So that's one thing. 2% to 3% coming from that move. The next thing is moving to less-expensive energy, like [indiscernible] where we are moving over to gas. That's one percentage point down the cost curve. Saudi Arabia is going to give us 2 percentage points and then productivity is going to give us 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Then in addition to that, kind of the cream on top is when we introduce the alumina pricing index, aligning the prices more to market fundamentals. Today, we have 33% of all customers on EPI at spot and we are actually promised we're going to increase that over the years as the opportunities come up.
So second thing is aluminum now. Same logic, left upper box shows you how we're going to drive down 10 percentage points on the cost curve. Starts again with the portfolio, right? On the right-hand side, you see what we're doing and here again, you see the announcement of 530,000 tons that we took up and you saw -- you see here, we've basically been using every single one of the levers that you can use when you restructured the high cost asset, we will continue to do that and always have in mind what are the cash implications of that, right? 
The second thing that we're go to do is do also here on restructuring the portfolio is looking at modernization, looking at opportunities to lower the cost curve with good assets. So one of the examples is our Canadian system, become more, we have reached an agreement to repower our Quebec smelters basically reaching until 2040. And the Massena East is another opportunity. There's an existing modernization proposal which would include a 30 to 40 years of competitive power cost. That alone is going to bring us down 2% to 3% down the cost curve, the modernization part. Then comes Saudi Arabia -- no, no, just go back. Another 2 percentage points on the cost curve. And then productivity, 1 to 2 percentage points on the cost curve. 
The upside here, comparable to API on the revenue side, on the value-add side is our casthouse. Basically, optimizing, optimizing the product mix and using the value-add creation more. Last year, we increased the way -- we professionalized the way we're using that and you can see it in the result, we got $262 million more margins purely from the casthouse, purely from that optimization. 
Next slide. Talking about Saudi Arabia, I mentioned it twice already, and here is an update on our growth project in Saudi Arabia. The pictures show the current status. Actually, that's a week old probably. You can see the plot line, the carbon plan, the liquid pitch tanks, the hot reversing mills. As you know, there are 2 phases, one is coming online in 2013 and the other one in 2014. I think the picture tell you at least one story, it's on time. I tell you another story, it's on budget. And both things come well together, right? So this is a great, great example of the Alcoa advantage. I mean, it's an integrated facility, mining, refining, smelting to rolling. And really, this is only possible through the Alcoa expertise and our reputation and our financial strength. 
Let's move on to the next segment. So told you the story how we're moving down the upstream business on the cost curve. Next one is how we're going to build out the Global Rolled Products. And here, there's $2.5 billion and higher profitability. Now the great news is 55% of the $2.5 billion incremental revenues have been reached in the first year, that's pretty cool, right? 
So the other thing that's equally outstanding is the profitability that we see in the first quarter. I mean, look at that, $430 per EBITDA per metric ton, the 10-year average is $235, right? And you see, I mean, how that sticks out. It's really an outstanding performance. So let's look a little closer at how GRP is going to get to those targets. 
So it starts but it doesn't end with aerospace. Here are the major platforms in aerospace. You see the build rates there and you actually do see that the build rates overall by 2013 have increased by 27%, that's pretty substantial. The good news is we are in pretty much every one of those and many more platforms, but those are the big platforms. And that's an excellent position that we have. In addition, the decision last year of Airbus and Boeing to have the A320 and the B737 as all aluminum planes and use them with innovative aluminum lithium obviously adds to it. This all provides a great platform for revenue as well as margin growth, GRPs, I mean our Global Rolled Business revenues, we believe, we can increase in this segment alone by 22% by 2013. 
As I said, this is not the only great segment to be in, packaging is another one. We have growth in there that varies between 4% to 20%. 20% is probably rather on the high side in China, that is. We are leading in some core regions. We are expanding like in Saudi Arabia. And there's innovation, you see it on the left hand side aluminum bottles, shaped cans, great innovations in that field. Same thing holds true for automotive North America. Growth rate 34%, we've talked about that before, but it's worth reminding everybody. Fuel efficiency standard. New fuel efficiency standards are the big driver. Light weighting is the name of the game. We are putting money behind. We are expanding them for $300 million. Most of the capacity that we are building is already committed. And the good news also is all of that would not be possible if we wouldn't have driven process innovations, so making the -- working with aluminum and other materials easier in the manufacturing process. Bringing the barriers to change from steel to aluminum down substantially. 
Last segment I want to talk about here is Consumer Electronics. Growth rate that we see here is 18% and the only thing I want to say is we are aluminizing also this end market. So besides from the key capabilities of our materials like lightweight, strength, formability. Many customers today are focusing more and more on sustainability and they are seeing it as a gigantic advantage. They have a material that truly is infinitely recyclable, and that drives the statistic of 75% of all aluminum ever produced in history on this planet still being in use. 
So how is that all going to work? Well, there's another cream on top of it in our Global Rolled Products business and this is our increased presence in the emerging markets like Russia and China. That's nice. In Russia, we have established ourself already as a key domestic supplier in some of the markets like packaging, aero and commercial and transportation. Nice performance last year on the profit side as well as on the growth side and we're working continuously also on new applications. 
So Russia, we are already nicely established. In China, we are establishing ourself. We have reached a positive EBITDA last year. We have a great joint venture partner that we will work with even more so in the midstream segment here with China Power Investment Corporation, signed a joint venture agreement focusing particularly on the growth in this segment. And we also see that there are growing segments, we're growing in the Kanshi [ph]. We are starting to become a reliable supplier for the automotive sector, and we are growing into the Consumer Electronics market.
So that's how GRP is going to do. Last but not least, let's talk about Engineered Products and Solutions. This is a great success story and they are on a good path for the 2013 target. Starts with the growth, they achieved 44% of the growth target of $1.6 billion in the first year after announcement. And guess what, they achieved that and also this quarter, another record performance, 19% margin, the highest ever quarter. So EPS continues of course to grow at margins above historic levels. 
So and if you haven't noticed that yet, I mean, EPS this quarter is contributing more than 50% to our core profits. So if you look at the -- out of this $1.6 billion of growth, $600 million are coming from the market and it's really important to understand what is our market position here? Let's start again with aerospace. You see this is the product in aerospace. Pretty much all of them in a #1 or #2 position and this represents 47% of all revenues, and the market is growing 13% to 14%. That alone is already wonderful position to be in. 
You go to heavy trucks and trailer. Again, we are in the lead that we are in fact North America. #1 position, clearly #1, represents 16% of the total revenue basis. North America growing 7% to 12%, wonderful. Airfoils, clear #1 position, represent 10% and it's a gross margin of 1% to 2% this year. But as I said early on, I'm very, very convinced that this market has a very strong future going forward. The only outlier in the way is the nonresidential construction market, not because we don't have a great position in there, we do have a great position there, in the U.S. particularly, but because it's currently not growing, but I'll also that I believe one day will change. 
So let's talk about the other part, the other $1 billion. I mean, $600 million, I talked about here in the market, the $1 billion comes to innovation, right? And innovation is pretty much the middle name of our Engineered Products and Solutions business. And here, you see on this slide quite a number of examples. I don't have the time to go through all of them but I'll pick one out, just that you get a feel for the value that we're bringing. I'll pick out the next-generation engine airfoils. And just keep in mind, the jet engine OEMs are now announcing their next-generation jet engine. 
And here are some statistics. 15%, reduced fuel consumption, 50% percent reduced emissions, 30% improved maintenance cycle. 15% percent noise reduction. The airfoils are critically enabler for that. Things like our advanced cooling schemes via the 3D platform core technologies are a substantial driver for better cooling and that allows a higher temperature in the burn chamber. The high-grade and single twisting technology alone allows us to increase the melting point up to 12%. And the thin trading etch technology brings the weight down by 20%. I think you get a feel for how substantial these type of technologies and these type of offerings are driving the value for our customers. That's why I'm really optimistic how we are going to reach this $1.6 billion. 
And last but not least, there's also the aspect of organic growth that I want to point out, we will continue to look for acquisitions. We've done that in the last year very successfully. You see here on the left hand side, from Fairchild, republic fund [indiscernible] fasteners, all of these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, increase our share and grow our profitability, and we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our portfolio and also to create value to our shareholders. 
Let's come to an end here. We had a strong start in 2012. We're delivering our promises. The markets are stabilizing. We're executing on our strategy. We're delivering results. Our upstream business moving down the cost curve and deliver strong productivity gains. Our midstream record profitability, good growth. Our downstream Engineered Products and Solutions record profitability, good growth. Cash management, outstanding, Chuck referred to it. And all of that works with leveraging all our core advantage from talent to technology, so we're well-prepared for the future whatever it will bring. But the near future is now to open the lines to you all to ask questions and us to give answers. So thank you very much."

249603,145606272,324997,"Alcoa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2012",2012-07-09,"Earnings Calls","Alcoa Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Kelly. As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview, I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity. So let's start with profitability.",3122,"Okay. Thanks, Kelly. As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview, I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity. 
So let's start with profitability. Loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $2 million or $0.00 per share, and if you exclude our restructuring and special items, income from operations is $61 million or $0.06 a share. As you can see, EBITDA and ATOI decreased sequentially primarily due to lower LME prices. 
And if you go through and break that down by segments and let's first look at our Upstream business, which is Alumina segment and the Primary segment. The quarter was marked by planned maintenance overhauls and power plant outages amidst a declining metal price. Businesses partially overcame these headwinds with continued productivity, higher regional premiums and favorable currency costs. 
The Global Rolled Products group generated higher volume and productivity to essentially offset the unfavorable pricing as they delivered another strong quarter. And in the downstream segment, volume and productivity exceeded not only the cost increases but the effect of the Massena fire as well as it generated another record quarter. In fact, both the midstream and downstream segments achieved record first half results. 
So if you take those into context of how we're progressing against our 3-year targets, in the upstream, we're continuing to try to move down the cost curve, taking curtailments and taking the other actions against the headwinds and our productivity. And in the midstream and downstream, we're progressing against our revenue goals, and we're continuing to set our margin records in both businesses. 
Let's move over to liquidity. We generated positive free cash flow of $246 million. That enabled us to pay down debt and finish the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we continued our streak on record low days of working capital, in fact, finishing the quarter at 33 days, which is 5 days lower than our previous record for the second quarter which was set in 2011. 
The debt-to-cap ratio increased to 36.1%, but on a net debt to cap ratio basis, where you'd include the cash component, we are down 31.6%. And as you can see on the liquidity stands right now that we're in a very strong liquidity position, and it's been supported by cash sustainability efforts. As you're aware, this is the fourth year now of our cash sustainability efforts, and we've previously achieved all of our targets in the previous 3 years, and we intend on achieving those as well this year. 
So let's move to the income statement. Revenue was steady sequentially on lower realized metal prices, they were down 4%, but that was offset by slightly higher Alumina pricing and higher volumes in our Global Rolled Products group. Our COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially basically because of lower metal prices. And we've added another category in the income statement this time, the other income expense item. you can see the change there, it's up $38 million and that's driven primarily by corporate piece of currency translation, which was a negative impact of $26 million in the quarter. 
If you look at our tax rate, it's obviously indiscernible this quarter because you're dealing with $6 million of loss before taxes and a positive tax of $13 million. Obviously, if you have the taxes in the various jurisdictions in the low income amount, it's going to give you an odd number. But within that, we had $10 million of discrete tax items which I'll cover in the special items in a minute. The main thing you should take away from this is the effective tax rate going forward, and we estimate that to be at 29% right now. 
We'll finish out looking at the bottom of the income statement at a $0.00 per share and a $2 million loss from continuing operations before special items. And now we'll flip over to the special items, and I'll give you a breakdown of those in the quarter. Really, none of these are special items that we haven't shown in previous quarters. I'll start off as $63 million in total. I'll start off with the restructuring piece which permanent headcount, reductions and lease terminations resulted in a $10 million charge. 
Then right below that, we've got the $10 million of discrete tax items that I referred to in the previous page, which were essentially prior period adjustments. We have an environmental reserve of after-tax of $13 million. We have revised action plans for -- have been approved in 3 of our environmental sites. Actually, 2 of those are increases and one of those is a decrease, the net of which gives us the $13 million in after-tax impact. 
We also have an $18 million litigation reserve. And during the quarter, we proposed to settle the Alba civil suit by offering Alba cash payment of $45 million. We also offered a long-term alumina supply contract. Based on the cash offer, we recorded a $45 million charge. We currently estimate an additional possible charge of up to $75 million to settle the suit. 
In addition, we have been in dialogue with the DOJ and the SEC regarding their investigations. A settlement of government's investigations can be reached is probable that the amount would be material in a particular period to Alcoa's results of operations. Since this is a matter involving ongoing litigation, we'll have no further statement. 
Moving to the next item, which is relates to the Massena fire. We had $12 million charge after-tax in the quarter, but it came from the Primary Metals group of $7 million and Engineered Products business in $5 million. So the sum total of all of those charges in the quarter was $63 million, gives us a net income from continuing ops after special items of $61 million or $0.06 a share. 
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. You can see we had $105 million of profitability in the first quarter, and that's gone down to $61 million. That's a decrease of $45 million -- $44 million sequentially. Obviously, it was a negative impact to the declining LME price and the net impact of that in currency gave us a $30 million negative impact in the quarter. 
We had $17 million profit improvement from volume, price mix and productivity. And unfortunately, it's not able to offset completely the $31 million of net increase in costs, but let me hit on a few of these major items here. First of all, the price mix of $31 million. We had an unfavorable price mix in Global Rolled Products, which I'll talk more about when I get to the segment data, and that was partially offset by a favorable original premiums in the Primary group. 
We also have $53 million of increased cost on this slide. As you can see, which related basically to maintenance, and 1/2 of which we highlighted in the first quarter guidance. We also had $41 million of productivity after taxes. That's being driven by improvements such as higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, lower scrap rates and usage reductions. 
In summary, currency and productivity was not enough to overcome the impact of lower metal prices and planned outages. 
So let's take a look further now and break it down by segment, and you're going to get a more revealing picture of the actual business performance. We'll start with the Alumina segment. 
In the Alumina segment, production and shipments were lowered, driven by the curtailments that we announced and the Australian maintenance overhauls. Third-party revenue is at $750 million, that's down 3% sequentially on the lower volumes. And the ATOI of $23 million is down from the $35 million that we recorded in the first quarter. 
In essence, the Australian dollar and Brazilian real weakened by 4% in 10%, respectively, and that resulted in a net LME and FX benefit of $25 million. Continued productivity gains of $7 million only partially offset the increased cost of $29 million from higher caustic usage, higher energy cost as well as the plant maintenance overhauls. 
As we look to the third quarter, pricing on Alumina Price Index will be at about 34% of third-party shipments, and the other pricing will continue to follow the 60-day lag. We expect caustic prices to remain level. Maintenance overhauls that have now been concluded will provide us $9 million of additional profitability in the third quarter, and we expect productivity gains to continue. 
So let's now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially on lower realized aluminum prices. In fact, if you looked at the prices, the LME price is down 6% sequentially on a 15-day lag basis, whereas our realized prices are down 4% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. 
If you look at the first quarter, we were at a $10 million profit, and that's gone to a $3 million loss. If you exclude the effect of Massena, the Primary Metals segment was essentially flat sequentially even in the light of a significant decline in metal prices. 
So how did they achieve that? You oculd see, the $39 million impact of LME and currency and that's been offset by $33 million of improved performance. We had the Rockdale and Warwick Power Plant outages that we have referred to in the first quarter guidance which were more than offset by unfavorable energy. We also had improved carbon cost, provided $6 million, improved productivity of $10 million and as I referred to in the income statement, we had a favorable price mix of $15 million due to the improved regional premiums. So very solid quarter given the slide in metal prices. 
If we look at the third quarter guidance, we would expect LME to follow the 15-day lag. Energy impact is expected to have a negative $20 million impact on ATOI. The seasonal variations drive higher energy prices. However, Rocdale and Warrick outages are now completes so we'll have $11 million improvement next quarter from that. And our productivity gains will continue and expect to offset the net impact of the energy and the outages. Our carbon cost expected to remain flat and the Massena fire and the impact of the Massena fire is expected to be flat as well. 
So if you take a step back and you look at the Alumina segment and the Primary segment combined, we would expect a net productivity improvement sequentially. 
Let's move to Flat-Rolled Products. Third-party shipments are up 32,000 tons or 7% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA at $390 per ton. We've got revenue up 4%, driven by stronger aerospace, commercial transportation, consumer electronics and the seasonal increase in packaging. Increased volume of $18 million and $12 million in productivity gains essentially offset price mix and cost increases. 
Let's spend a minute on price mix. If you look at how our price with our customers follows through LME prices, it's usually a 15- to 30-day period that prices of the LME impact our customers, yet the cost of our metal flowing through is more like on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you've seen normally compressed margins on falling metal prices and increased margins on rising prices as you see this quarter. 
If you looked at the first half, we set records on ATOI and EBITDA per metric ton in this business. Both at 6% higher in ATOI and 7% higher on EBITDA per metric ton. in fact, at $409 a ton, which is 74% higher than the 10 year average. If we look to the third quarter, our auto continues to be strong. European demand remains uncertain, pricing demand pressures persist. We expect slower growth rates in China and Russia and productivity gains to continue. 
Let me point out as we have before, that if you look at the seasonal declines it take place with some holidays, automotive change orders and the like, especially in the segment, historically, we've seen somewhere between a 30% and 35% decline. If you were to exclude the impacts of metal pricing currency, we would expect, because of our productivity efforts and the impacts that we've made in markets in volumes, that we would be down only 10% to 15% sequentially in the third quarter of this year. 
Let's move on to the Engineered Products and Solutions segments. Really another strong performance in this segment. Revenue, EBITDA and ATOI all up sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, we set a record margin for the quarter at 19.4%, and that's including the impact of the Massena fire. In fact, without that, we'd be over 20%. We're on track to achieve our 3-year revenue and margin targets. 
If you looked at what we expect in the third quarter, we would expect more of the same, to tell you the truth, even with a seasonal slowdown we've seen in Europe and the impact from nonresidential building and construction, then we do expect to have a heavy duty truck rates to be down in the second half versus the first half. But with all of that and our continued share gains and productivity, we would expect this segment to be flat, and that's even in the context that we normally would see a 10% decline on a seasonal basis. But going into third quarter this year based on our current condition, we expect it to be flat. 
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. From a cash flow statement, we had cash from operations of $537 million. That led to a positive free cash flow of $246 million. Obviously, what jumps out at you right away is this $202 million in the first quarter and taxes and other adjustments and a $478 million in the second quarter. 
If you may remember the first quarter, we have annual and semiannual payments that get made on both interest variable comp that don't repeat in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we also had a tax refund of $70 million, and all the reserves that I went through on the special items, they are run through income but they obviously on cash advance in the first -- in the second quarter so we pulled those back out. That's the reason for the biggest change here. 
If you looked at where we stand on pensions, we continue to fund our pension plans with cash after $213 million in the first quarter a comment was another $239 million in the second quarter. And I'm sure you're all aware that there was a Bill just passed, the Highway Bill just passed that had pension relief to give you some information around that and how it impacts us, the new pension funding requirements start using a discount rate that has any 5-year average instead of 24 month average. We would expect to benefit from that, and we're taking a look at what it would mean to us this year. We would expect to release relief this year to be anywhere from the $100 million to $130 million range and relief go into next year anywhere from $225 million to $250 million. 
We think this will bring our arrest of funding up to approximately 90%. If we move down to debt to cap, it's at 36.1% but that's due to currency translation impact in our equity from a stronger U.S. dollar. And as I've said earlier, if you used a cash component it took our net debt to cap down to 31.6%. We've got $1.7 billion of cash on hand and we showed a 5-day improvement on days working capital. 
Let's move to the next slide and I'll embellish on that. We ended the quarter with 33 days. That's a 5-day improvement versus last year. That equates to about $325 million worth of cash. In fact, if you go back to 2009 when we initiated the cash sustainability work, we were at 50 days in the second quarter. That's a 17-day improvement up to this quarter, which is equal to about $1.1 billion in cash. Now this is the 11th consecutive quarter that we showed year-over-year improvement, and it's across every one of our businesses. We expect to continue as we move forward. 
Let's now move to our next slide. Just a few comments about this slide. As you can see, we show a historical view to show in the context since the recession occurred in late '08 and beginning '09. Through our efforts around cash sustainability really enabled us to even generate profitability in the face of volatile economic environment and significantly declining metal prices more important to continue to be put ourself in a good liquidity position. 
By showing you previously, we've got $1.7 billion of cash on hand but we're also able to pay off $200 million of debt. We've increased our free cash flow to $246 million. You can see from this historical basis that we see a benefit coming out of the first quarter which is usually a cash used to fund and we expect to be in our targeted range of 30% to 35% on debt to cap as we move forward and by the end of the year. So let me take a minute and summarize it if I could. 
First of all about our annual targets and that's in the middle column. And the overarching target is to be positive free cash flow. I'll start at the bottom with the maintaining the debt-to-cap at 30%, 35%. I told you that's our goal at the end of the year. If you take our expenditures sustain a CapEx growth cap rates and Saudi Arabia, that all adds up to $1.7 billion, and we're on track to achieve that expenditure level, albeit within that expenditure level. Both overhead and working capital we're going to achieve both of those targets. And on productivity gains, just to give you an idea where we stand, we have put forward productivity gains of $800 million, we're through 6 months, we're already at $591 million for the year on a year-over-year basis so tracking extremely well against that. 
Klaus is going to elaborate further on how we're executing against our strategy, but if you just look at the second quarter results, we've continued to execute against the curtailments and try and drive down costs and upstream operations, but progressing well against our revenue targets and our midstream and downstream, and in fact, we've set records for first half margin on both midstream and downstream segments, so performing well against our liquidity goals, as well as our 3-year targets. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Klaus."

So why don't we start in the usual fashion and look at our end markets and let's try to make it quick as quickly as possible. 
So the picture that we're seeing here is a mixed picture, but overall, and I stress it today, we see positive growth continuing in most of our end markets. Let's go through the segment and let's start with aerospace. Our view really has not changed. We expect 13% to 14% growth this year. It's driven by strong performance in the last commercial aircraft segment. And today, we see about 8,300 aircraft as a backlog. This is basically at today's production and backlog pretty amazing. 
We also see on the business jets side the confidence we have come back. The recent single largest order industry that has ever been place in the segment is clear underlining for that niche at facing on order of up to 425 business jets. But we also believe that the impact of the business jet segment is probably going to get compensated by the anticipated decline in the military aircraft site. 
Let's move on to automotive as the next segment. We expect 4% to 8% growth on a global basis. This is on our projection up slightly from 7% which we actually projected for the year the last quarter, and that's driven basically by North America, where we see and expect 10% to 14% growth. If you look at the June seasonally adjusted annual rates, it comes out with 14.05 million vehicles. This is up 22% year-over-year or 15% year-to-date. That's a pretty substantial number. 
Growth is down minus 4% to minus 9% and that's truly a function of the economic turmoil. China remains positive. We see plus 2% to plus 7% despite a slow start in the year. Heavy trucks and trailer, mixed picture down compared to the view that we had in the first quarter. North America is really driving it. We believe that heavy truck production will slow down in the second half of the year, and this will get production in line again with lower orders. We see plus 4% to plus 8% growth for the full year. That's lower than what we saw before in the first quarter. 
But let's also remember, if you look at the fact here, the average age of the fleet today is 6.69 years. That's the oldest on record. The 20-year average is 5.85 so obviously, there is a need a replacement at one point in time and that's going to drive demand. 
In Europe, we continue to see declines, we project minus 3% to minus 8%. But for China, we revised our forecast from 0% to 5% growth to minus 3% to minus 8%. This is mainly driven by the need infrastructure spending which is supposed to begin now in the third quarter of this year, and we believe the market in the second half is going to see a pickup. 
Next segment, beverage, cans, and packaging. We continue to expect to do 3% global growth driven by China, South America, Middle East, North America, Europe. Those are the main drivers basically of growth, and even in North America, keep in mind North America always makes up to almost 1/2 of the segment than we see early signs of improvement from your market segment. That's a good thing. 
From Russia, building and construction, globally, we continue to project 2.5% to 3.5% growth. China, Brazil, India and other emerging countries are really the foundation for that. But if you look at North America and Europe, we continue to see this heavily, most leading indicator so either flat or near record low or even deteriorating so no good news on that and so far when it comes to North America and Europe. 
Last segment here, industrial gas turbines. We're increasing our growth expectations to 3% to 5% from what we had originally in the last quarter 1% to 2%, and this is really driven by 2 factors: new builds, we see this increasing and increased demand also for spare parts; and it's an interesting fact piece, we've been talking about gas and some of the discussions that we have with some of you on the phone in April this year. The first time in the history of the EAI recordkeeping that gas and coal-fired power generation achieved the same market share here in the U.S., clear indication that something is happening there -- 
So this concludes basically the view on our end markets so let's focus now on the question, what does that all mean for our Alumina market? And you see it here broken down by the different regional segments. Global aluminum demand continues to be strong. We said previously we believe it's going to grow by 7% this year, and we continue to maintain this view, and when you see where this is coming from, we actually see that China continues to grow substantially. 11% is our assumption here. Good demand growth also in other markets here from Asia, India, Middle East, North America, Brazil, Russia, we saw the main driver as you can see here from the chart. 
So the real question what does that all the demand picture here on this page? What does that mean for the supply-demand situation? So let's start with the Alumina segment here. And as you can see depicted here, we believe Alumina is moving back into balance, and this is really driven by 2 factors: One is the recently announced refinery curtailments in China, and we do expect higher alumina imports from China, and we see some of that already. And why is that so? And we've seen we put this here on the right-hand side because Indonesia has imposed a bauxite export ban. Keep in mind 60% of the bauxite that is used in China, therefore making alumina is imported and 80% of that comes from Indonesia, so this is a big news for the refinery industry in China. 
And interestingly, the exports from all our information tell us are really the export ban is really executed so this have a 4-week time lag, but I mean, we would see more of that. So far how it looks is not that easy to get an export license at all. 2 companies only have been granted a license, and one thing is very clear, it's going to be more expensive, right? There's going to be an export tax, that is coming on top of it if you get a license. And that export tax basically means you have $5 to $10 more per metric ton of bauxite. So add it to basically the already very expensive and high-cost refineries in China, so that is certainly not going to help the already quite questionable profitability of many of the refineries in China. 
You're going to have and you see it down here in that chart in the stacked bars has built an inventory. The inventory makes up to about 1 to 2 months, 5.9 million tons. We've also seen that up to May, the Alumina imports have been substantially up by about 128%. So we also have seen that the Chinese announced refinery cuts as a reaction to the uncertain bauxite supply. And the real question is going to be how is it going to go forward with Indonesia? Are exports ever coming back? And I mean obviously, the market will have to watch that. 
So let's move onto the next segment, the aluminum segment. And on the aluminum segment, we continue to see the deficit in aluminum. The curtailments are occurring, you see that here on the right-hand side. We basically put in here what we are seeing out there. We also see when we start -- let's start with the upper part of this table here, which is China. We are seeing that the expansion continues but at a slower pace. And as we expected and said already in the first quarter, China is curtailing, and they have curtailed about 1.2 million already since the end of last year. We're estimating another 350,000 tons to come off-line by the second half of this year, and the outlook is to China to be in the deficit of 350,000 tons this year. 
Look at the rest of the world, which is a lower, the lower table there on the right-hand side. Demand, we believe, is going to increase by 3%. You saw that or you could calculate that from the slides that I showed you 2 slides before. But if you look at the production, the production is not keeping up with the demand. Production is pretty much flat, and if you figure in the announced curtailments as we showed them here and the very fact that there's really no new capacity coming online in 2012, we expect the deficit. 
If you look at all of this, and I want to make one thing crystal clear here, the market is working and we do see that people are moving forward with curtailing or responding by slower build out as we see in China. And I think that's clearly a function of the lower LME pricing situation that we currently have in the market. 
So let's look at the physical premiums at the next slide. Well, I mean given the supply demand fundamentals that I just showed you, I mean, you see what's going on here. It's really no surprise that the regional programs continue to go up, right. That's what you see here. They've gone up substantially. They are a function of really 2 factors in the main: The one is physical demand, we talked about that; the second thing is the attractiveness of aluminum as an asset class. And in today's very volatile world, this is a relatively risk-free return environment, and people are recognizing that and that's why their money is flowing in. 
So let's also take a look at the inventories and let me apologize right away for this slide. But I hope you will like it as much as I do when I have a chance to go through it but you have to bear with me because it's a little complex. Right, so let's start with what is depicted here in this mountain slide. What you do see here is a view of the global inventories from 2005 to today. And the layers that you see there are the different layers of inventory. But we have made a big effort to not just show the visible inventory here but also show what's called the invisible inventory with a reasonable estimate, right? So that's what you see here in this mountain charts, as I call it, right? 
So first thing you noticed is wow, there was a peak in 2009. Well, we all know that. What you also noticed that has gone substantially down from the peak in 2009. To be clear, it has come 27 days down from 2009 so that's a substantial decline. What you also notice is that it has continued to come down even now from between the first quarter and the second quarter. We've seen 3 days have been shaved off, it's now at 75 days and at the end of the first quarter, it was at 78 days. 
We also see something else which I hope you will see. There is this little layer that has been building up, the sick yellowish layer, I hope it comes through on your PC, the thick yellowish layer on the absolute top. And what that is, is the layer of what's called canceled warrants. The canceled warrants are basically driven by the strong demand from the to finance metal and to use it, as I described it, as an asset class to help for a while because it only makes sense to cancel the warrant if you really want to hold it for a wild and move it off the LME exchange, right. That's a clear indication of the attractiveness of that, and also the trust in that market because people are moving it off the exchange basically safe storage costs. 
That's what you see here too. And now the last thing that you see here is also very interesting focused on the top 3 yellow boxes that we have there. And let's start with the left box there. And the left box basically shows -- by the way, you now have to also take a look at the blue line. The blue line is the LME price, right? This is the LME 3-month price that we've layered over there. 
And what you would expect? I mean, the inventory builds up, you see an oversupply that these an inventory buildup, you basically that in the 2008 timeframe. Oh yes, metal price goes down pretty substantially, right. Yes, that's clear. I mean, inventory builds up, oversupply, price goes down, right? Now we see a reverse when it comes off the peak there. Basically, inventory goes down and yes, you do see metal price goes up, rise, and there is because people have certain expectations. That's what you see there. 
And then you go to the end of this period, which is now, and you do see something very odd there. You see that the inventory continues to come down, the metal price substantially comes down, right? So that's an interesting phenomenon. The phenomenon pretty much starts around mid-2011. So we dug a little deeper into that phenomenon, and bear with me for -- I mean, I think 2 or 3 slides that I want to use here now. 
Right. So let's forget about the inventory slide for a moment, and let's go to what we really are talking about, and that is supply demand balance, right? Because in the end, it's a question of do we have oversupply, do we have undersupply that drives price, we've all learned that, right? And this is what is depicted here in this slide, this slide goes back also to 2006. 
And you see this period here I mean you see that the bars here if it's above 0, it's an oversupply situation. Below, it's basically a deficit, right, surplus or deficit, right. So when you see the blue line continues to be the LME cash price here. So what you see here is exactly following the supply demand project very, very nicely. You see when it goes up, price goes down, and price goes down, price goes up. And then comes the period here in 2011 so you suddenly see something else is happening. You see the market is going into a deficit, and at the same time, prices substantially fall. 
So what happened in the middle of 2011? So I guess to find out what happened is we have to look at the macro environment because where we can find it in our market. So look at the macro environment, this is a standard chart. You've seen that before, it just has the new numbers added to it. When you look at some of those indicators, I would suggest the one that's giving you the most forward-looking is probably the Purchasing Managers Index, right. 
And if you look at the period at question here kind of I mean the mid-2011, you do see that something changes there. It looks as though there was a recovery underway and then slowly, this thing starts sinking down. From then on, it goes up a little, it goes down and recently it's been weakening again. 
So what we do see here it's highly -- this Purchasing Managers Index decline is highly driven by concerns over Europe and the sustainability of the Eurozone as we all know and basically we hear it every day, right? This has also affected as we saw in the last slide the commodity prices, the metal prices. They've all come down also recently. 
So we've done one other analysis which I want to share with you, and then we're done with this part and we can focus on the company, right, but I think it's important to understand that. And this 2 analysis that show what's going on here. The left-hand side, what we did here is we correlated the LME 3 months price to the Dow Jones UBS commodity basket, right? And what you see here and it's a 12-year analysis basically starting January '01 so it's a long time frame, right? 
What you see here on the left hand side, you see this fluctuation is up and down, up and down, and you would expect that because basically means aluminum has its own dynamics. And they are -- they slowed up and down from the commodity basket because other commodities are different, right? The trending up that you see in general as the second effect here on the left-hand side, I would explain that by saying this is the time frame from 2001 on where people were starting to discover the commodities cycle, where people are starting to talk about wow, this is a commodity cycle do some fundamentally going on emerging markets are growing. 
Then you see this phase which is already starting and kind of mid-2009 where suddenly this thing the commodities swing in sync with aluminum, right, and a very, very tight range, very, very high correlations. And I must say today, I mean, almost seems like aluminum is in sync with our commodities, right? 
Now our team made another analysis which I found equally interesting after that one here, and that's shown here on the right-hand side. And that shows the correlation between the 3 months LME price and the S&P 500 index, right? And same period -- same time period, 12 years time period almost. And you do see what you would expect to where there is really is no correlation between the S&P 500 and the LME because they are very, very different fundamentalists and swings and various directions. But then you see funny end up at the same time period this goes up and if you see it today I mean is still not on a non-correlated 0.5 but substantially different from what we've seen before. And you see that the swings today it swings a van with the S&P 500 index swings. So the real question is as a general economic sentiment currently overtaken the market fundamentals? And I guess this really answer to that is yes, right? 
So the question is -- the question is well historically, I mean, what prevails? And that's why I wanted to remind you of the fundamentals, right? Because in the end, I believe the fundamentals prevail. And humankind always wants to explain certain phenomena and very often gravitates away from the fact so that's why I want to remind us all of what are the facts in the aluminum market. We do see 7% growth this year, right? 
Secondly on the supply demand picture, alumina we believe is balanced. We already see a tightness meaning a deficit in aluminum. Inventories are declining substantially from the peak 27 days from the peak, 3 days from the last quarter. Premiums are at a record high so the fundamentals in the market are sound, right? 
So that's really all wonderful but I think the important message here is let's really -- and the more important message is we as Alcoa are driving our competitiveness no matter how the market is going to be, right? I think we've shown that through the whole crisis that we've seen from 2008 on. That's what I want to focus the rest because that is really the most important thing. And how are we doing that? How are we gaining our competitiveness? What business actions are taking to make ourselves more future proof. 
So let's start with the Alumina segment, right? And all of the Alumina as well as the aluminum segment, one of the big things is worth focusing on proving our cost position. You see here on the upper left-hand side is the current profitability has been impacted by price decline. We see cost headwind that can hit the refineries. 
The right-hand side, I mean, the response clearly is we are going to come down on the cost curve. We said that we're going to come down 7 percentage points, and we believe that we're going to get 1 to 3 points shaved off by the end of 2013. Why do we believe that? Because the actions are in place. The curtailments that we announced 390,000 tons here on the refining side are completed, right? And this basically the Atlantic regions. We have seen profits productivity gains of $270 million since the end of 2010. We are creeping production basically Western Australia, another $125 million of profit. We've come down on the days working capital by 7 days. That alone gives us $110 million in cash. And last but not least on that Saudi Arabia, we find it will be coming on line as well underway going to get online in 2014. 
And let's talk about Alumina pricing index, basically getting Alumina priced with the fundamentalists. We believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot by the year end. On the Primary side, Primary Metals side, the upper left side here are Primary Metals business is substantially impacted by lower LME price. You see that here reflected in the profitability. What best defense we have other than moving down the cost of that is what we're doing were going to take 10 percentage points off. We project that we're going to take 3 to 6 percentage points off by 2013. And hwy are we pretty sure that, that is working because the actions are in place. 
Was complete the curtailments, we'll represent 40% of our global capacity. Add to that the permanent closures of 290,000 tons that are underway Tennessee and Rockdale, that's another 6% of our capacity. Activity gains $310 million, 8 days of days working capital improvement $235 million of cash. That is in Saudi Arabia, lowest-cost facility on-time and on budget coming online in 2013. 
We are also using the value-add side here, and this is the cash cow in a much, much better way by producing value products like billiard work. And in the first half year alone, that has added 337 additional margin to our bottom line. 
So let's go to the midstream segment. In the midstream segments, where the Global Rolled Products segment, we've seen a record first-half profitability with $409 per metric ton. You see the 10-year average is at $235. That's pretty phenomenal. The utilization has increased. We now have an 85% utilization, pretty strongly driven by the big segments, aerospace, auto and packaging. And I think is also comfort to room to grow at an incrementally higher margin level. 
Left lower side, we see how we're tracking against our revenue targets. Remember, $2.5 billion by 2013. We believe that we can get 67% of our growth target in on that and LME normalized basis in this year, by the end of this year. 
Aero and auto, I talked about that and we'll talk a little bit more about it. Productivity gains $215 million -- $218 million Saudi Arabia is on-time, on budget, coming online 2013, cut out 7 days of working capital left again $140 million of additional cash. Engineered Products and Solution is another record quarter, they're moving from record to record. I think Chuck mentioned that already $276 million EBITDA, record EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and that includes even the Massena outage. 
Basically use the time of the crisis to reposition the portfolio and the downturn, and now they are growing and showing quarter-over-quarter improvement. And that's really very, very good to see. The utilization is up and aerospace as well as in the rest, we are on track to meet our revenue target's $1.6 billion that is up to next year 63% of that we believe are going to get this year. Productivity, nice. I mean, EPS in general is a strong platform before profitable growth. We've got a lot on getting innovations and share gains through that $1 billion out of the $1.6 billion target comes from that. 
So let me finish with reminding you of 2 important developments in our end markets that give you a feel for what's going on there, all right. Let's start with automotive. And here on the left-hand side, you see a pretty amazing slide, and that is it goes back to 1975, right? And projected until 2025, and that's really tells a nice story because it shows the pounds of aluminum per vehicle. And you see that this is an ongoing story of alumina in the industry. 
Heat exchanges blocks and now the next frontier is clear in stores and body and wide. The market for it is also clear people, people are going for higher fuel efficiency and the general emissions regulation is helping the new cap in the U.S. 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, 54.5 by 2025. There's a broad-based trend going on here is not just any more reserved to a luxury or top line segment but it's going to all segments and it's covering the volume segment. That's why be believe in the North America, you would see a demand increase of 60% by 2025. Aluminum sheet use will triple by 2015. We are very well positioned to capture this demand $300 million in Davenport to expand Davenport ready for the automotive market, and the good news is this is supported by secured orders. 
Saudi Arabia will include an auto body sheet and manufacturing capability, and we are evaluating further expansion, giving the situation in this market. Aerospace is the second market I want to put a little word in here, and after all, 50% of the Engineered Products and Solution revenues are generated there and their exciting opportunities. Why is it exciting. already talked about this thing that depicted here on the left 8 years on or backlog. And when you look forward, you basically see travel demand is up, people project it to be 5% up over the next 20 years. The fleet is aging so people are basically experts are saying is going to be demand for 35,000 new planes and you're talking about 1,842, I mean, no precision of this forecast of planes every year. 
So that's why we are putting a lot of effort into innovating and improving our position in this market and gaining share through innovation. And let me just briefly close here by showing you 3 of the more recent ones that we've come in. Style lighting strike issues you say why is that an issue? Well, it's an issue because statistically every plane gets it at least once during their lifetime by strike and some airplanes are going into non-conductive carbon fiber solution, I mean, this is the very critical question of how do you get the lightning strike managed and that's where the fasteners come in and they have solved this problem for our customers, right? 
The good news is not only did they solve that but they actually solved another problem to and that's but the problem that particularly comes in the more different materials you combine. Because always keep in mind, airplanes are going up and down in the air. On the ground, they have currently here in New York about 100 Fahrenheit, and up in the air at 30,000 feet, they have sub-zero have some theoretical it's a couple of times during the day. So that's a great, great innovation that we've been able to do there. 
The next second example, there's a next-generation of turbines coming in that are much more efficient 15% more fuel efficient, 15% less emissions and I could go on and on and on. Why is that possible? A major enabler our technologies that we are putting in place here. Multi-wall Street the coding scheme and they directly air to get to the critical areas because these turbines are operating at temperatures that are above the melting point of the materials inside of the turbine. The metals that the turbine blades are made of. Keep in mind also this is not this is not aluminum. This is typically nickel alloys that we're using there. We're talking here about the downstream subtle things. 
Single the melting point increase of 12%. Substantial. getting blade weights down by 20%, they're beautiful, beautiful innovation. And last thing that I want to mention is a third-generation aluminum lithium together with advanced structural concept. This alone we feel is capable of shaving 6% to 10% of the weight off of an aircraft and double the time of the inspection interval and increased passenger comforts. These innovations do capture the attention of our customers and here on the right-hand side, you see the key OEMs and it's really in my view no surprise that we are working very, very closely pretty much with every one of those. 
So let me sum it up and then open it up to -- open it up for questions. Basically, we have solid market fundamentalists, strong aluminum demand, 7%, supply and demand balance or in the deficit. We are focusing on improving our competitiveness coming down on the cost curve and the upstream profitable growth and the midstream as well as in the downstream, and we're tracking well here for this year to reach our targets. And then there are exciting things in it for our future, 2 exciting markets I talked about, automotive, aerospace and there's more. 
So all of this will continue to make a stronger going forward and do we'll managed through whatever the environment has in it for us. So let's now open the lines and take some questions."

As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview. I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity.So let's start with profitability. L",3130,"Okay. Thanks, Kelly. As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview. I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity.
So let's start with profitability. Loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $2 million or $0.0 per share, and if you exclude our restructuring and special items, income from operations is $61 million or $0.06 a share. As you can see, EBITDA and ATOI decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower LME prices. 
But if you go through and break that down by segments, and let's first look at our upstream business, which is Alumina segment and the Primary segment. The quarter was marked by planned maintenance overhauls and power plant outages amidst the declining metal price. The businesses partially overcame these headwinds with continued productivity, higher regional premiums and favorable currency costs.
The Global Rolled Products group generated higher volume and productivity to essentially offset the unfavorable pricing as they delivered another strong quarter. And in the downstream segment, volume and productivity exceeded not only the cost increases but the effect of the Massena fire as well as it generated another record quarter. In fact, both the midstream and downstream segments achieved record first half results. 
So if you take those in the context of how we're progressing against our 3-year targets, in the upstream, we're continuing to try to move down the cost curve, taking curtailments and taking the other actions against the headwinds in our productivity. And in the midstream and downstream, we're progressing against our revenue goals, and we're continuing to set our margin records in both businesses.
Let's move over to liquidity. We generated positive free cash flow of $246 million. That enabled us to pay down debt and finish the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we continued our streak on record low days of working capital. In fact, finishing the quarter at 33 days, which is 5 days lower than our previous record for the second quarter which was set in 2011.
The debt-to-cap ratio increased to 36.1%, but on a net-debt-to-cap ratio basis, where you'd include the cash component, we are down to 31.6%. And as you can see on the liquidity stands right now that we're in a very strong liquidity position, and it's been supported by cash sustainability efforts. As you're aware, this is the fourth year now of our cash sustainability efforts. And we've previously achieved all of our targets in the previous 3 years, and we intend on achieving those as well this year. 
So let's move to the income statement. Revenue was steady sequentially on lower realized metal prices that were down 4%. But that was offset by slightly higher alumina pricing and higher volumes in our Global Rolled Products group. Our COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially, basically because of lower metal prices. And we've added another category in the income statement this time, the other income expense item. You can see the change there. It's up $38 million, and that's driven primarily by corporate fees of currency translation, which was a negative impact of $26 million in the quarter. 
If you look at our tax rate, it's obviously indiscernible this quarter, because you're dealing with $6 million of loss before taxes and a positive tax of $13 million. Obviously, if you have the taxes in the various jurisdictions in the low income amount, it's going to give you an odd number. But within that, we had $10 million of discrete tax items, which I'll cover in the special items in a minute. The main thing you should take away from this is the effective tax rate going forward, and we estimate that to be at 29% right now.
So you finish out looking at the bottom of the income statement at a $0.0 per share and a $2 million loss from continuing operations before special items. 
And now we'll flip over to the special items, and I'll give you a breakdown of those in the quarter. Really, none of these are special items that we haven't shown in previous quarters. I'll start off, $63 million in total. I'll start off with the restructuring piece, which permanent headcount reductions and lease terminations resulted in a $10 million charge.
Then right below that, we've got the $10 million of discrete tax items that I referred to in the previous page, which were essentially prior period adjustments. 
We have an environmental reserve of after-tax of $13 million. We have revised action plans for -- have been approved in 3 of our environmental sites. Actually, 2 of those are increases and one of those is a decrease, the net of which gives us the $13 million in after-tax impact.
We also have an $18 million litigation reserve. And during the quarter, we proposed to settle the Alba civil suit by offering Alba cash payment of $45 million. We also offered a long-term alumina supply contract. Based on the cash offer, we recorded a $45 million charge. We currently estimate an additional possible charge of up to $75 million to settle the suit. 
In addition, we have been in dialogue with the DOJ and the SEC regarding their investigations. If a settlement of government's investigations can be reached, it is probable that the amount would be material in a particular period to Alcoa's results of operations. Since this is a matter involving ongoing litigation, we'll have no further statement.
Moving to the next item, which is -- relates to the Massena fire. We had $12 million charge after-tax in the quarter, but it came from the Primary Metals group of $7 million and Engineered Products business in $5 million. So the sum total of all of those charges in the quarter was $63 million, gives us a net income from continuing ops after special items of $61 million or $0.06 a share.
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. You can see we had $105 million of profitability in the first quarter, and that's gone down to $61 million. That's a decrease of $45 million -- $44 million sequentially. Obviously, it was a negative impact to the declining LME price and the net impact of that in currency gave us a $30 million negative impact in the quarter.
We had $17 million of profit improvement from volume, price mix and productivity. And unfortunately, it's not able to offset completely the $31 million of net increase in costs. But let me hit on a few of these major items here. 
First of all, the price mix of $31 million. We had an unfavorable price mix in Global Rolled Products, which I'll talk more about when I get to the segment data, and that was partially offset by a favorable original premiums in the Primary group.
We also had $53 million of increased cost on this slide, as you can see, which related basically to maintenance, and half of which we highlighted in the first quarter guidance. We also had $41 million of productivity after taxes. That's being driven by improvements such as higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, lower scrap rates and usage reductions.
In summary, currency and productivity was not enough to overcome the impact of lower metal prices and plant outages. 
So let's take a look further now and break it down by segment, and you're going to get a more revealing picture of the actual business performance. We'll start with the Alumina segment.
In the Alumina segment, production and shipments were lowered, driven by the curtailments that we announced and the Australian maintenance overhauls. Third-party revenue is at $750 million, that's down 3% sequentially on the lower volumes. And the ATOI of $23 million is down from the $35 million that we recorded in the first quarter. 
In essence, the Australian dollar and Brazilian real weakened by 4% and 10%, respectively, and that resulted in a net LME and FX benefit of $25 million. Continued productivity gains of $7 million only partially offset the increased cost of $29 million from higher caustic usage, higher energy cost, as well as the plant maintenance overhauls. 
As we look to the third quarter, pricing on alumina price index will be at about 34% of third-party shipments, and the other pricing will continue to follow the 60-day lag. We expect caustic prices to remain level. Maintenance overhauls that have now been concluded will provide us $9 million of additional -- of profitability in the third quarter, and we expect productivity gains to continue.
We now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially on a lower realized aluminum prices. In fact, if you look at the prices, the LME price is down 6% sequentially on a 15-day lag basis, whereas our realized prices are down 4% sequentially and 18% year-over-year.
When you look at the first quarter, we were at a $10 million profit, and that's gone to a $3 million loss. If you exclude the effect of Massena, the Primary Metals segment was essentially flat sequentially even in the light of a significant decline in metal prices.
So how did they achieve that? You could see the $39 million impact of LME and currency, and that's been offset by $33 million of improved performance. We had the Rockdale and Warrick Power Plant outages that we referred to in the first quarter guidance, which were more than offset by unfavorable energy. We also had improved carbon cost, provided $6 million; improved productivity of $10 million; and as I referred to in the income statement, we had a favorable price mix of $15 million due to the improved regional premiums. So very solid quarter given the slide in metal prices.
If we look at the third quarter guidance, we would expect LME to follow the 15-day lag. Energy impact is expected to have a negative $20 million impact on ATOI. The seasonal variations drive higher energy prices. However, Rockdale and Warrick outages are now completes, so we'll have $11 million improvement next quarter from that. And our productivity gains will continue and expect to offset the net impact of the energy and the outages. 
Our carbon cost expected to remain flat. The Massena fire -- or the impact of the Massena fire is expected to be flat as well. 
So if you take a step back and you look at the Alumina segment and the Primary segment combined, we would expect a net productivity improvement sequentially.
Let's move to Flat-Rolled Products. Third-party shipments are up 32,000 tons or 7% sequentially with adjusted EBITDA at $390 per ton. We've got revenue up 4%, driven by stronger aerospace, commercial transportation, consumer electronics and the seasonal increase in packaging.  Increased volume of $18 million and $12 million in productivity gains essentially offset price mix and cost increases.
Let's spend a minute on price mix. If you look at how our price in -- with our customers follows through LME prices, it's usually 15- to 30-day period that prices of the LME impact our customers, yet the cost of our metal flowing through is more like on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you'd see normally compressed margins on falling metal prices and increased margins on rising prices as you see this quarter.
If you look at the first half, we set records on ATOI and EBITDA per metric ton in this business, both at 6% higher on ATOI and 7% higher on EBITDA per metric ton. In fact, that's $409 a ton, which is 74% higher than the 10 year average. If we look to the third quarter, aero our auto continues to be strong. European demand remains uncertain, pricing demand pressures persist. We expect slower growth rates in China and Russia and productivity gains to continue. 
Let me point out as we have before, that if you look at the seasonal declines that take place, both from holidays, automotive changeovers and the like, especially in this segment, historically, we've seen somewhere between a 30% and 35% decline. If you were to exclude the impacts of metal pricing currency, we would expect, because of our productivity efforts and the impacts that we've made in markets and volumes, that we would be down only 10% to 15% sequentially in the third quarter of this year.
Let's move on to the Engineered Products and Solutions segments. Really another strong performance in this segment. Revenue, EBITDA and ATOI are all up sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, we set a record margin for the quarter at 19.4%, and that's including the impact of the Massena fire. In fact, without that, we'd be over 20%. We're on track to achieve our 3-year revenue and margin targets.
If you look at what we expect in the third quarter, we would expect more of the same, to tell you the truth, even with a seasonal slowdown we've seen in Europe and the impact from nonresidential building construction, and we do expect the heavy duty truck rates to be down in the second half versus the first half. But with all of that and our continued share gains and productivity, we would expect this segment to be flat, and that's even in the context that we normally would see a 10% decline on a seasonal basis. But going into third quarter this year based on current condition, we expect it to be flat.
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. From a cash flow statement, we had cash from operations of $537 million. That led to a positive free cash flow of $246 million. Obviously, what jumps out at you right away is this $202 million in the first quarter. And taxes, other adjustments and -- a $478 million in the second quarter.
As you may remember the first quarter, we have annual and semiannual payments that get made on both interest variable comp that don't repeat in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we also had a tax refund of $70 million. And all the reserves that I went through on the special items, they are run through income, but they're obviously on a cash advance in the first -- in the second quarter, so we pulled those back out. That's the reason for the biggest change here.
If you look at where we stand on pensions, we continue to fund our pension plans with cash after $213 million in the first quarter. It was another $139 million in the second quarter. And I'm sure you're all aware that there was a bill just passed, the highway bill just passed that had pension relief. I'll give you some information around that and how it impacts us. 
The new pension funding requirements are going to start using a discount rate that has a 25-year average instead of 24-month average. We would expect to benefit from that. We're taking a look at what it would mean to us this year. We would expect relief this year to be anywhere from the $100 million to $130 million range and relief going into next year anywhere from $225 million to $250 million. We think this will bring our arrears of funding up to approximately 90%. 
If we move down to debt to cap, it's at 36.1%, but that's due to currency translation impact in our equity from a stronger U.S. dollar. And as I've said earlier, if you use the cash component, it took on the net debt to cap down to 31.6%. We've got $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we showed a 5-day improvement on days working capital.
Let's move to the next slide, and I'll embellish on that. We ended the quarter with 33 days. That's a 5-day improvement versus last year. That equates to about $325 million worth of cash. In fact, if you go back to 2009 when we initiated the cash sustainability work, we were at 50 days in the second quarter. That's a 17-day improvement up to this quarter, which is equal to about $1.1 billion in cash. This is the 11th consecutive quarter that we showed year-over-year improvement, and it's across every one of our businesses, we expect to continue as we move forward.
Let's now move to our next slide. Just a few comments about this slide. As you can see, we show a historical view to show in the context since the recession occurred in late '08 and beginning '09 where our efforts around cash sustainability have really enabled us to even generate profitability in the face of volatile economic environment and significantly declining metal prices, but more important, to continue to be -- put ourselves in a good liquidity position.
By showing you previously, we got $1.7 billion of cash on hand, but we're also able to pay off $200 million of debt. We've increased our free cash flow to $246 million. You can see from this historical basis that we see a benefit coming out of the first quarter, which is usually a cash use of funds, and we expect to be in our targeted range of 30% to 35% on debt to cap as we move forward and by the end of the year. So let me take a minute and summarize it, if I could.
First of all about our annual targets and that's in the middle column, and the overarching target is to be positive free cash flow. So I'll start at the bottom with you. Maintaining the debt to cap at 30%, 35%, I told you that's our goal for the end of the year. 
If you take our expenditures, sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx in Saudi Arabia, that all adds up to $1.7 billion, and we're on track to achieve that expenditure level, albeit within that expenditure level. Both overhead and working capital, we're going to achieve both of those targets. 
And on productivity gains, just to give you an idea where we stand, we have put forward productivity gains of $800 million. We're through 6 months, we're already at $591 million for the year on a year-over-year basis, so tracking extremely well against that.
Klaus is going to elaborate further on how we're executing against our strategy. But if you just look at the second quarter results, we've continued to execute against the curtailments and try and drive down costs in our upstream operations. We're progressing well against our revenue targets in our midstream and downstream. And in fact, we've set records for first half margin on both midstream and downstream segments, so performing well against our liquidity goals, as well as our 3-year targets.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Klaus."

But overall, and I st",5102,"Well, Chuck, thank you very much. So why don't we start with -- in the usual fashion, where we look at our end markets and let's try to make it quick, as quickly as possible.
So the picture that we're seeing here is a mixed picture. But overall, and I stress it today, we see positive growth continuing in most of our end markets. 
So let's go through the segments and let's start with aerospace. Our view really has not changed. We expect 13% to 14% growth for this year. It's really driven by strong performance on the last commercial aircraft segment. Today, we see about 8,300 aircraft as a backlog. This is basically at today's production and 8 years backlog. That's pretty amazing.
We also see, on the business jets side, the confidence. We have come back. The recent single largest order in history that has ever been placed in the segment is the clear underlining for that group of net jets, facing an order of up to 425 business jets. But we also believe that the impact of the business jet segment is probably going to get compensated by the anticipated decline in the military aircraft side.
Let's move onto automotive as the next segment. We expect 4% to 8% growth on a global basis. This is on our projection, up slightly from 3% to 7%, which we actually projected for the year at the last quarter. And that's driven basically by North America, where we see and expect 10% to 14% growth. If you look at the June seasonally adjusted annual rates, it comes out with 14.05 million vehicles. This is up 22% year-over-year or 15% year-to-date. That's a pretty substantial number.
Europe is down, minus 4% to minus 9%, and that's truly a function of the economic turmoil. China remains positive. We see 2% -- plus 2% to plus 7% despite a slow start in the year. 
Heavy trucks and trailer, mixed picture, down compared to the view that we had in the first quarter. North America is really driving it. We believe that heavy truck production will slow down in the second half of the year, and this will get production in line again with lower orders. We see plus 4% to plus 8% growth for the full year. That's lower than what we saw before in the first quarter.
But let's also remember, if you look at the fact here, the average age of the fleet today is 6.69 years. That's the oldest on record. The 20-year average is 5.85. So obviously, there is a need for replacement at one point in time, and that is going to drive demand. 
For Europe, we continue to see declines. We project minus 3% to minus 8%. But for China, we revised our forecast from 0% to 5% growth to minus 3% to minus 8%. This is mainly driven by the delayed infrastructure spending, which is supposed to begin now in the third quarter of this year. And we believe the market in the second half is going to see a pickup.
Next segment, beverage, cans, and packaging. We continue to expect to do 3% global growth, driven by China, South America, Middle East, North Africa, Europe. Those are the main drivers basically of growth. And even in North America, always keep in mind, North America always makes up for almost half of this segment. And we see early signs of improvement from your market segment. That's a good thing.
Commercial building and construction, globally, we continue to project 2.5% to 3.5% growth. China, Brazil, India and other emerging countries are really the foundation for that. But if you look at North America and Europe, we continue to see this heavily under pressure. The most leading indicators are either flat or a near record low or even deteriorating. So no good news on that and so far when it comes to North America and Europe. 
Last segment here, industrial gas turbines. We're increasing our growth expectations to 3% to 5% from what we had originally in the last quarter 1% to 2%. And this is really driven by 2 factors: new builds, we see this increasing and an increased demand also for spare parts. And as an interesting fact piece, we've been talking about gas and somewhat -- some of the discussions that we had with some of you on the phone in April this year, the first time in the history of the EAI, the record keeping that gas and coal-fired power generation achieved the same market share here in the U.S., clear indication that something is happening there.
So this concludes basically the view on our end markets, so let's focus now on the question, what does that all mean for our alumina market? And you see it here broken down by the different regional segments. The global aluminum demand continues to be strong. We said previously we believe it's going to grow by 7% this year, and we continue to maintain this view. And when you see where this is coming from, we actually see that China continues to grow substantially, 11% is our assumption here. Good demand growth also in other markets here from Asia, India, Middle East, North America, Brazil, Russia, those are main driver, as you can see here from the chart. 
So the real question is what does that -- all the demand picture here on this page, what does that mean for the supply-demand situation? So let's start with the Alumina segment here. And as you can see depicted here, we believe Alumina is moving back into balance, and this is really driven by 2 factors: One is the recently announced refinery curtailments in China, and we do expect higher alumina imports from China and we see some of that already. 
And why is that so? And we've seen as -- we put this here on the right-hand side because Indonesia has imposed a bauxite export ban. Keep in mind, 60% of the bauxite that is used in China, therefore, making alumina is imported. And 80% of that comes from Indonesia, so this is a big news for the refinery industry in China.
And interestingly, the exporters, from all our information tell us are really the export ban is really executed, so this have a 4-week time lag. But I mean, we would see more of that. 
So far how it looks is not that easy to get an export license, that only 2 companies only have been granted a license. And one thing is very clear, it's going to be more expensive, right? So there's going to be an export tax that is coming on top of it, if you get a license. And that export tax basically means you have $5 to $10 more per metric ton of bauxite, added to basically the already very expensive and high-cost refineries in China. So that is certainly not going to help the already quite questionable profitability of many of the refineries in China.
China has, and you see it down here in that chart on the stacked bars, has built an inventory. The inventory makes up to about 1 to 2 months, 5.9 million tons. We've also seen that up to May, the alumina imports have been substantially up by about 128%. So we also have seen that the Chinese announced refinery cuts as a reaction to the uncertain bauxite supply. And the real question is going to be how is it going to go forward with Indonesia? Are exports ever coming back? And I mean obviously, the market will have to watch that.
So let's move onto the next segment, the aluminum segment. And on the aluminum segment, we continue to see a deficit in aluminum. The curtailments are occurring. You see that here on the right-hand side. We basically put in here what we are seeing out there. We also see why don't we start -- let's start with the upper part of this table here, which is China. We are seeing that the expanding continues but at a slower pace. And as we expected and said already in the first quarter, China is curtailing, and they have curtailed about 1.2 million already since the end of last year. And we are estimating another 350,000 tons to come offline by the second half of this year. And the outlook is -- to China to be in the deficit of 350,000 tons this year.
Look at the rest of the world, which is a lower, the lower table there on the right-hand side. Demand, we believe, is going to increase by 3%. You saw that -- or you could calculate that from the slides that I showed you 2 slides before. But if you look at the production, the production is not keeping up with the demand. Production is pretty much flat. And if you figure in the announced curtailments as we showed them here and the very fact that there's really no new capacity coming online in 2012, we expect a deficit.
You look at all of this, I want to make one thing crystal clear here, this -- the market is working, and we do see that people are moving forward with curtailing, are responding by slower build-out as we see in China. And I think that's clearly a function of the lower LME pricing situation that we currently have in the market.
So let's look at the physical premiums at the next slide. Well, I mean, given the supply-demand fundamentals that I just showed you, I mean, you see what's going on here. It's really no surprise that the regional premiums continue to go up, right? That's what you see here. It's gone up substantially. They are a function of really 2 factors in the main: The one is physical demand, we talked about that; second thing is the attractiveness of aluminum as an asset class. And in today's very volatile world, this is a relatively risk-free return environment, and people are recognizing that, and that's why their money is flowing in. 
So let's also take a look at the inventories, and let me apologize right away for this slide. But I hope you will like it as much as I do when I have a chance to go through it, but you have to bear with me because it's a little complex. 
Right, so let's start with what is depicted here in this mountain slide. What you do see here is a view of the global inventories from 2005 to today. And the layers that you see there are the different layers of inventory. But we have made a big effort to not just show the visible inventory here, but also show what's called the invisible inventory with a reasonable estimate, right? So that's what you see here in this mountain chart, as I call it, right? 
So first thing you notice is ""Wow, there was a peak in 2009."" Well, we all know that. But you also notice it has gone substantially down from the peak in 2009. And to be clear, it has come 27 days down from 2009, so that's a substantial decline. What you also notice is that it has continued to come down even now from between the first quarter and the second quarter. We've seen 3 days have been shaved off, it's now at 75 days. And at the end of the first quarter, it was at 78 days.
We also see something else, which I hope you will see. There is this little layer that has been building up, this thick yellowish layer, I hope it comes through on your PC. This thick yellowish layer on the absolute top, and what that is, is a layer of what's called canceled warrants. And the canceled warrants are basically driven by a strong demand from the -- to finance metal and to use it, as I described it, as an asset class we held for a while, because it only makes sense to cancel the warrant if you really want to hold it for a while and move it off the LME exchange, right? That's a clear indication of the attractiveness of that, and also the trust in that market because people are moving it off the exchange to basically save storage costs. So that's what you see here too. 
And now the last thing that you see here, and that's also very interesting, focus on the top 3 yellow boxes that we have there. And let's start with the left box there. And the left box basically shows -- and by the way, you now have to also take a look at the blue line there. The blue line is the LME price, right? This is the LME 3-month price that we've laid -- layered over there.
And what you would expect, I mean the inventory build is up. You see an oversupply that leads to an inventory buildup. You basically that in the 2008 time frame. Oh yes, metal price goes down pretty substantially, right? Yes, that's clear. I mean, inventory builds up; oversupply, price goes down, right? 
Now we see a reverse when it comes off the peak there. Basically, inventory goes down. And yes, you do see metal price goes up, right? And there is obviously lag time in between a little bit there because people have certain expectations. So that's what you see there.
And then you go to the end of this period, which is now, and you do see something very odd there. You see that the inventory continues to come down, but the metal price substantially comes down, right? So that's an interesting phenomenon. The phenomenon pretty much starts around mid-2011. So we dug a little deeper into that phenomenon, and bear with me for -- I mean, I think 2 or 3 slides that I want to use here now.
Right. So let's forget about the inventory side -- slide for a moment, and let's go to what we really are talking about, and that is supply-demand balance, right? Because in the end, it's a question of do we have oversupply, do we have undersupply that drives price. We've all learned that, right? And this is what is depicted here in this slide, this slide goes back also to 2006.
And you see this period here, I mean you see that the bars here: If it's above 0, it's an oversupply situation; below, it's basically a deficit, right? Surplus or deficit, right? So when you see the blue line continues to be the LME 3 cash price here. So what you see here is exactly following the supply-demand logic. Very, very nicely you see, when it goes up, price goes down; when it goes down, price goes up. And then comes the period here in 2011, so you suddenly see something else is happening. You see the market is going into a deficit. And at the same time, prices substantially fall.
So what happened in the middle of 2011? So I guess to find out what happened is we have to look at the macro environment because we can't find it in our market. So look at the macro environment, this is a standard chart. You've seen that before. It just has the new numbers added to it. When you look at some of those indicators, I would suggest the one that's giving you the most forward look is probably the Purchasing Managers' Index, right?
And if you look at the period at question here kind of -- I mean the mid-2011, you do see that something changes there. It looks as though there was a recovery underway. And then slowly, this thing starts sinking down. From then on, it goes up a little, it goes down and recently it's been weakening again.
So what we do see here, it's highly -- this Purchasing Managers' Index decline is highly driven by concerns over Europe and the sustainability of the Eurozone as we all know, and basically we hear it every day, right? This has also affected, as we saw on the last slide, the commodity prices, the metal prices. They've all come down also recently.
So we've done one other analysis, which I want to share with you. And then we're done with this part and we can focus on the company, right? But I think it's important to understand that. And there's 2 analysis that show what's going on here. The left-hand side, what we did here is we correlated the LME 3-month price with the Dow Jones-UBS commodity basket, right? And what you see here, and it's a 12-year analysis, basically you're starting at January '01. So it's a long time frame, right? 
And what you see here on the left-hand side, you see there's fluctuation, up and down, up and down. And you would expect that, because it basically means aluminum has its own dynamics. And they are -- they slowed up and down from the commodity basket because other commodities are different, right? 
The trending up that you see in general as the second effect here on the left-hand side, I would explain that by saying this is the time frame from 2001 on where people were starting to discover the commodity cycle, where people are starting to talk about, wow, this is a commodity cycle. There's something fundamentally going on. Emerging markets are growing. 
But then you see this phase, which is already starting kind of mid-2009 where suddenly this thing, the commodities swing in sync with aluminum, right, and a very, very tight range, very, very high correlations. And I must say today, I mean it almost seems like aluminum was in sync with our commodities, right?
Now our team made another analysis, which I found equally interesting after that one here, and that's shown here on the right-hand side. And that shows the correlation between the 3-month LME price and the S&P 500 Index, right, and same period -- same time period, 12 years time period almost. And you do see what you would expect to where there is really no correlation between the S&P 500 and the LME, because they are very, very different fundamentals. It swings and various directions. 
But then you see -- funny enough, at the same time period, this goes up. And if you see it today, I mean it's still not 1-on-1 correlated, it's 0.5. But substantially different from what we've seen before. And you see that the swings today, it swings -- even with the S&P 500 Index, it swings. So the real question is has the general economic sentiment currently overtaken the market fundamentals, right? And I guess there's really not much other than the answer to that is yes, right? 
So the question is well historically, I mean, what prevails, right? And that's why I wanted to remind you of the fundamentals, right? Because in the end, I believe the fundamentals prevail. And humankind always wants to explain certain phenomena and very often gravitates away from the fact, so that's why I want to remind us all of what are the facts in the aluminum market. We do see 7% growth this year, right? 
Secondly on the supply-demand picture, alumina we believe is balanced. We already see a tightness, meaning a deficit in aluminum. Inventories are declining substantially from the peak, 27 days from the peak, 3 days from the last quarter. Premiums are at a record high. So the fundamentals in the market are sound, right?
So that's really all wonderful, but I think the important message here is let's really -- and the more important message is we as Alcoa are driving our competitiveness no matter how the market is going to be, right? I think we've shown that through the whole crisis that we've seen from 2008 on. And that's what I want to focus the rest on because that is really the most important thing. And how are we doing that? How are we gaining our competitiveness? What business actions are we taking to make ourselves more future proof.
So let's start with the Alumina segment, right? And all in the Alumina, as well as the aluminum segment, one of the big things is we're focusing on improving our cost position. What you see here on the upper left-hand side is the current profitability has been impacted by price decline. We see cost headwinds, like fuel, oil and costs that can hit the refineries.
On the right-hand side, I mean the response clearly is we are going to come down on the cost curve. We said that we're going to come down 7 percentage points, and we believe that we're going to get 1 to 3 points shaved off by the end of 2013. Why do we believe that? Because the actions are in place. The curtailments that we announced, 390,000 tons here on the refining side are completed, right? And this is basically the Atlantic region. 
We have seen profits -- productivity gains of $270 million since the end of 2010. We are creeping production at our lower-cost facilities, basically the Western Australia, another $125 million of profit. 
We've come down on the days working capital by 7 days. That alone gives us $110 million in cash. And last but not least on that, in Saudi Arabia, refinery and mine will be coming online. It's well underway, going to get online in 2014.
And let's talk about alumina pricing index, basically getting aluminum priced with the fundamentals. We believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot by the year end. 
On the Primary side, Primary Metals side, the upper-left side here, our Primary Metals business is substantially impacted by lower LME price. You see that here reflected in the profitability. What best defense do we have other than moving down on the cost curve? That's we -- what we're doing. We're going to take 10 percentage points off. We project that we're going to take 3 to 6 percentage points off by 2013. And why are we pretty sure that, that is working? Because the actions are in place.
Once Italy is completed, the curtailments will represent 40% of our global capacity. Add to that the permanent closures of 290,000 tons that are underway, Tennessee and Rockdale. That's another 6% of our capacity. 
Productivity gains, $310 million; monetizing Tapoco; 8 days of days working capital improvement; $235 million of cash, that is in Saudi Arabia; lowest-cost facility, on-time and on-budget coming online in 2013.
We are also using the value-add side here, and this is the cash cow in a much, much better way, by producing value of products like bar [ph], wire, rod, flap. And in the first half year alone, that has added 337 additional margin to our bottom line. 
So let's go to the midstream segment. On the midstream segments, where the Global Rolled Products segment, we've seen a record first half profitability with $409 per metric ton. You see the 10-year average is at $235. That's pretty phenomenal. The utilization has increased. We now have an 85% utilization, very strongly driven by the big segments, aerospace, auto and packaging here. And I think there's also a comfortable room to grow at an incrementally higher margin level.
On the left-lower side, we see how we're tracking against our revenue targets. Remember, $2.5 billion by 2013. We believe that we can get to 67% of our growth target in on an LME normalized basis in this year, by the end of this year.
Aero and auto, I talked about that and we'll talk a little bit more about it. Productivity gains $215 million -- $218 million. Saudi Arabia is on-time, on-budget, coming online 2013; set out 7 days of working capital. That's again $140 million of additional cash. 
Engineered Products and Solution achieved another record quarter. They're moving from record to record. I think Chuck mentioned that already, $276 million EBITDA, record EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and that includes even the Massena outage.
But they've basically use the time of the crisis to reposition the portfolio in the downturn, and now they are growing and showing quarter-over-quarter improvement, and that's really very, very good to see. 
The utilization is up in aerospace as well. As of the rest, we are on track to meet our revenue target, it's $1.6 billion, that is up to next year. 63% of that we believe we're going to get this year. Productivity, nice. I mean EPS in general is a strong platform before profitable growth. We've got a lot on getting innovations and share gains through that, $1 billion out of the $1.6 billion target comes from that. 
So let me finish with reminding you of 2 important developments in our end markets that give you a feel for what's going on there, all right? Let's start with automotive. And here on the left-hand side, you see a pretty amazing slide, and that is it goes back to 1975, right, and projected until 2025. And that really tells a nice story, because it shows the pounds of aluminum per vehicle. And you see that this is an ongoing story of alumina in the industry, right?
Heat exchangers, wheels, heads, blocks, hoods and now the next frontier,  it's clear, it's doors and body in white.  And the market preference is also clear. People are going for higher fuel efficiency. And the general emissions regulation is helping the new CAFE rules here in the U.S., 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, 54.5 by 2025. There's a broad-based trend going on here, and it's not just any more reserve to a luxury or top line segment, but it's going through all segments and it's covering the volume segment. That's why be believe in the North America, we would see a demand increase of 60% by 2025.  Aluminum sheet use will triple by 2015. 
We are very well positioned to capture this demand, we've just left $300 million in Davenport to expand Davenport, ready for the automotive market. And the good news is this is supported by secured orders. 
Saudi Arabia will include an auto body sheet in manufacturing capability, and we are evaluating further expansion, given that situation in this market. 
Aerospace is the second market I want to put a little word in here, and after all, 50% of the Engineered Products and Solution revenues are generated there and there are exciting opportunities. Why is it exciting? I already talked about this thing that depicted here on the left-hand side, 8 years auto backlog. And when you look forward, you basically see travel demand is up. People project it to be 5% up over the next 20 years. The fleet is aging, so people are basically -- experts are saying there's going to be demand for 35,000 new planes, and they are talking about 1,842 -- I mean note that the precision of that forecast of planes every year. 
So that's why we are putting a lot of effort into innovating and improving our position in this market and gaining share through innovation. And let me just briefly close here with showing you 3 of the more recent ones that we've come in. Fasteners that are solving lighting strike issues, you'd say, ""Why is that an issue?"" Well, it's an issue because statistically every plane gets it at least once during their lifetime, by lightning strike. And as some airplanes are going into nonconductive carbon fiber solution, I mean this is a very critical question of how do you get the lightning strike managed. And that's where the fasteners come in, and they have solved this problem for our customers, right? 
The good news is not only did they solve that, but they actually solved another problem, too, and that's the fatigue problem. That particularly covers in the more different materials you combine. Because always keep in mind, airplanes are going up and down in the air. On the ground, they have currently here in New York about 100 Fahrenheit. And up in the air at 30,000 feet, they have sub-zero and they do it a couple of times during the day. So that's a great, great innovation that we've been able to do there. 
There's a next -- second example, there's a next-generation of turbines coming in that are much more efficient, 15% more fuel efficient, 50% less emissions, and I could go on and on and on. Why is that possible? A major enabler, our technologies that we are putting in place here: Multi-Wall/3D Airfoil Cooling Schemes. And they direct the air to get the air to the critical areas, because these turbines are operating at temperatures that are above the melting point of the materials inside of the turbine. There's -- the metals that the turbine blades are made of. Keep in mind also, this is not aluminum. This is typically nickel alloys that we're using there. We are talking about the downstream sort of things.
Single Crystal, another one, melting point increase of 12%, substantial. Thin Airfoil Equiax Process getting blade weights down by 20%. They're beautiful, beautiful innovation all along then.
The last thing that I want to mention is a third-generation aluminum lithium, together with advanced structural concepts. And this alone, we feel is capable of shaving 6% to 10% of the weight off of an aircraft and double the time of the inspection interval and increase passenger comfort. These innovations do capture the attention of our customers. And here on the right-hand side, you see the key OEMs, and it's really in my view, no surprise that we are working very, very closely pretty much with everyone of those. 
So let me sum it up and then open it up for questions. We basically have solid market fundamentals; strong aluminum demand, 7%; supply and demand balance or in a deficit. We are focusing on improving our competitiveness, coming down on the cost curve in the upstream profitable growth and the midstream, as well as on the downstream. And we're tracking well here for this year to reach our targets. And then there are exciting things in it for our future, 2 exciting markets I talked about, automotive, aerospace and there's more. 
So all of this will continue to make us stronger going forward and we'll manage through whatever the environment has in it for us. So let's now open the lines and take some questions."

And I believe that, that's what we are doing and that's what we are going to do, and then let the market do what the market is going to do. The right thing is to increase our competitiveness, particularly -- and then those segments and the upstream segment the best way to do it is to come down on the cost curve. On Alumina, we are not that badly positioned. We're around the 30s percentile these days, so that's not really -- that's really good. I mean, and we will be shaving off 1 to 3 percentage points here by the end of next year, which is also a nice, nice thing.

And we believe 3 to 6 percentage points, we're going to be able to shave off next year, and you've seen all the actions around that. But we really can't leave out anything there Saudi Arabia on aluminum is coming online in 2013, so that's going to help. And it's just one thing adds to another."

249603,145606272,325011,"Alcoa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2012",2012-07-09,"Earnings Calls","Alcoa Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Kelly. As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview, I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity.So let's start with profitability. L",3128,"Okay. Thanks, Kelly. As we start out on the first slide here with a financial overview, I'd kind of like to break down the highlights here between those that relate to profitability and those that relate to liquidity.
So let's start with profitability. Loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $2 million or $0.0 per share and if you exclude our restructuring and special items, income from operations is $61 million or $0.06 a share. As you can see, EBITDA and ATOI decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower LME prices. 
But if you go through and break that down by segments and let's first look at our upstream business, which is Alumina segment and the Primary segment, the quarter was marked by planned maintenance overhauls and power plant outages amidst the declining metal price. The businesses partially overcame these headwinds with continued productivity, higher regional premiums and favorable currency costs.
The Global Rolled Products group generated higher volume and productivity to essentially offset the unfavorable pricing as they delivered another strong quarter. And in the downstream segment, volume and productivity exceeded not only the cost increases but the effect of the Massena fire as well as it generated another record quarter. In fact, both the midstream and downstream segments achieved record first half results. 
So if you take those in the context of how we're progressing against our 3-year targets, in the upstream we're continuing to try to move down the cost curve, taking curtailments and taking other actions against the headwinds in our productivity. And in the midstream and downstream, we're progressing against our revenue goals and we're continuing to set margin records in both businesses.
Let's move over to liquidity. We generated positive free cash flow of $246 million. That enabled us to pay down debt and finish the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we continued our streak on record low days of working capital, in fact finishing the quarter at 33 days, which is 5 days lower than our previous record for the second quarter which was set in 2011.
The debt-to-cap ratio increased to 36.1% but on a net-debt-to-cap ratio basis where you'd include the cash component, we are down to 31.6%. And as you can see on the liquidity stands right now that we're in a very strong liquidity position, and it's been supported by cash sustainability efforts. As you're aware, this is the fourth year now of our cash sustainability efforts. And we've previously achieved all of our targets in the previous 3 years, and we intend on achieving those as well this year. 
So let's move to the income statement. Revenue was steady sequentially on lower realized metal prices that were down 4%, but that was offset by slightly higher alumina pricing and higher volumes in our Global Rolled Products group. Our COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially, basically because of lower metal prices. And we've added another category in the income statement this time, the other income expense item. You can see the change there. It's up $38 million, and that's driven primarily by corporate fees of currency translation, which was a negative impact of $26 million in the quarter. 
If you look at our tax rate, it's obviously indiscernible this quarter because you're dealing with $6 million of loss before taxes and a positive tax of $13 million. Obviously, if you have the taxes in the various jurisdictions in the low income amount, it's going to give you an odd number. But within that we had $10 million of discrete tax items, which I'll cover in the special items in a minute. The main thing you should take away from this is the effective tax rate going forward, and we estimate that to be at 29% right now.
So you finish out looking at the bottom of the income statement at a $0.0 per share and a $2 million loss from continuing operations before special items. 
And now we'll flip over to the special items, and I'll give you a breakdown of those in the quarter. Really, none of these are special items that we haven't shown in previous quarters. I'll start off, $63 million in total. I'll start off with the restructuring piece, which permanent headcount reductions and lease terminations resulted in a $10 million charge.
Then right below that, we've got the $10 million of discrete tax items that I referred to in the previous page, which were essentially prior period adjustments. 
We have an environmental reserve of after-tax of $13 million. We have revised action plans for -- have been approved in 3 of our environmental sites. Actually, 2 of those are increases and one of those is a decrease, the net of which gives us the $13 million in after-tax impact.
We also have an $18 million litigation reserve. And during the quarter, we proposed to settle the Alba civil suit by offering Alba cash payment of $45 million. We also offered a long-term alumina supply contract. Based on the cash offer, we recorded a $45 million charge. We currently estimate an additional possible charge of up to $75 million to settle the suit. 
In addition, we have been in dialogue with the DOJ and the SEC regarding their investigations. If a settlement of government's investigations can be reached, it is probable that the amount would be material in a particular period to Alcoa's results of operations. Since this is a matter involving ongoing litigation, we'll have no further statement.
Moving to the next item, which is -- relates to the Massena fire. We had $12 million charge after-tax in the quarter, but it came from the Primary Metals group of $7 million and Engineered Products business of $5 million. So the sum total of all of those charges in the quarter was $63 million, gives us a net income from continuing ops after special items of $61 million or $0.06 a share.
Now let's move on to the sequential earnings bridge. You can see we had $105 million of profitability in the first quarter, and that's gone down to $61 million. That's a decrease of $45 million -- $44 million sequentially. Obviously, it was a negative impact to the declining LME price and the net impact of that in currency gave us a $30 million negative impact in the quarter.
We had $17 million profit improvement from volume, price mix and productivity. And unfortunately, it's not able to offset completely the $31 million of net increase in costs. But let me hit on a few of these major items here. 
First of all, the price mix of $31 million. We had an unfavorable price mix in Global Rolled Products, which I'll talk more about when I get to the segment data and that was partially offset by favorable original premiums in the Primary group.
We also had $53 million of increased cost on this slide, as you can see, which related basically to maintenance and half of which we highlighted in the first quarter guidance. We also had $41 million of productivity after taxes. That's being driven by improvements such as higher utilization rates, process innovations and efficiencies, lower scrap rates and usage reductions.
In summary, currency and productivity was not enough to overcome the impact of lower metal prices and plant outages. 
So let's take a look further now and break it down by segment and you're going to get a more revealing picture of the actual business performance. We'll start with the Alumina segment.
In the Alumina segment, production and shipments were lowered, driven by the curtailments that we announced and the Australian maintenance overhauls. Third-party revenue is at $750 million, that's down 3% sequentially on the lower volumes. And the ATOI of $23 million is down from the $35 million that we recorded in the first quarter. 
In essence, the Australian dollar and Brazilian real weakened by 4% and 10%, respectively, and that resulted in a net LME and FX benefit of $25 million. Continued productivity gains of $7 million only partially offset the increased cost of $29 million from higher caustic usage, higher energy costs, as well as the plant maintenance overhauls. 
As we look to the third quarter, pricing on alumina price index will be at about 34% of third-party shipments, and the other pricing will continue to follow the 60-day lag. We expect caustic prices to remain level. Maintenance overhauls that have now been concluded will provide us $9 million of additional -- of profitability in the third quarter, and we expect productivity gains to continue.
We now move on to the Primary segment. Third-party revenue of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially on a lower realized aluminum prices. In fact, if you look at the prices, the LME price is down 6% sequentially on a 15-day lag basis, whereas our realized prices are down 4% sequentially and 18% year-over-year.
When you look at the first quarter, we were at a $10 million profit, and that's gone to a $3 million loss. If you exclude the effect of Massena, the Primary Metals segment was essentially flat sequentially even in the light of a significant decline in metal prices.
So how did they achieve that? You could see the $39 million impact of LME and currency, and that's been offset by $33 million of improved performance. We had the Rockdale and Warrick Power Plant outages that we referred to in the first quarter guidance, which were more than offset by unfavorable energy. We also had improved carbon cost, provided $6 million; improved productivity of $10 million; and as I referred to in the income statement, we had a favorable price mix of $15 million due to the improved regional premiums. So very solid quarter given the slide in metal prices.
If we look at the third quarter guidance, we would expect LME to follow the 15-day lag. Energy impact is expected to have a negative $20 million impact on ATOI as the seasonal variations drive higher energy prices. However, Rockdale and Warrick outages are now complete, so we'll have $11 million improvement next quarter from that and our productivity gains will continue and expect to offset the net impact of the energy and the outages. 
Our carbon costs are expected to remain flat. The Massena fire -- or the impact of the Massena fire is expected to be flat as well. 
So if you take a step back and you look at the Alumina segment and the Primary segment combined, we would expect a net productivity improvement sequentially.
Let's move to Flat-Rolled Products. Third-party shipments are up 32,000 tons or 7% sequentially with adjusted EBITDA at $390 per ton. We've got revenue up 4%, driven by stronger aerospace, commercial transportation, consumer electronics and the seasonal increase in packaging. Increased volume of $18 million and $12 million in productivity gains essentially offset price mix and cost increases.
Let's spend a minute on price mix. If you look at how our price in -- with our customers follows through LME prices, it's usually 15- to 30-day period that prices of the LME impact our customers, yet the cost of our metal flowing through is more like on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you'd see normally compressed margins on falling metal prices and increased margins on rising prices as you see this quarter.
If you look at the first half, we set records on ATOI and EBITDA per metric ton in this business, both at 6% higher on ATOI and 7% higher on EBITDA per metric ton. In fact that's $409 a ton, which is 74% higher than the 10 year average. If we look to the third quarter, aero and auto continues to be strong. European demand remains uncertain, pricing demand pressures persist. We expect slower growth rates in China and Russia and productivity gains to continue. 
Let me point out as we have before, that if you look at the seasonal declines that take place, both from holidays, automotive changeovers and the like, especially in this segment, historically we've seen somewhere between a 30% and 35% decline. If you were to exclude the impacts of metal pricing currency, we would expect, because of our productivity efforts and the impacts that we've made in markets and volumes, that we would be down only 10% to 15% sequentially in the third quarter of this year.
Let's move on to the Engineered Products and Solutions segments. Really another strong performance in this segment. Revenue, EBITDA and ATOI are all up sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, we set a record margin for the quarter at 19.4%, and that's including the impact of the Massena fire. In fact without that, we'd be over 20%. We're on track to achieve our 3-year revenue and margin targets.
If you look at what we expect in the third quarter, we would expect more of the same to tell you the truth, even with a seasonal slowdown we've seen in Europe and the impact from nonresidential building construction, and we do expect heavy duty truck rates to be down in the second half versus the first half. But with all of that and our continued share gains and productivity, we would expect this segment to be flat, and that's even in the context that we normally would see a 10% decline on a seasonal basis. But going into third quarter this year based on current condition, we expect it to be flat.
Now let's move to the cash flow statement. From a cash flow statement, we had cash from operations of $537 million. That led to a positive free cash flow of $246 million. Obviously what jumps out at you right away is this $202 million in the first quarter and taxes, other adjustments and -- a $478 million in the second quarter.
As you may remember the first quarter, we have annual and semiannual payments that get made on both interest variable comp that don't repeat in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we also had a tax refund of $70 million. And all the reserves that I went through on the special items, they are run through income, but they're obviously on a cash advance in the first -- in the second quarter, so we pulled those back out. That's the reason for the biggest change here.
If you look at where we stand on pensions, we continue to fund our pension plans with cash after $213 million in the first quarter. It was another $139 million in the second quarter. And I'm sure you're all aware that there was a bill just passed, the highway bill just passed that had pension relief. I'll give you some information around that and how it impacts us. 
The new pension funding requirements are going to start using a discount rate that has a 25-year average instead of 24-month average. We would expect to benefit from that. We're taking a look at what it would mean to us this year. We would expect relief this year to be anywhere from the $100 million to $130 million range and relief going into next year anywhere from $225 million to $250 million. We think this will bring our Arista Funding up to approximately 90%. 
If we move down to the debt to cap, it's at 36.1% but that's due to currency translation impact in our equity from a stronger U.S. dollar. And as I've said earlier if you use the cash component, it took on the net debt to cap down to 31.6%. We've got $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we showed a 5-day improvement on days working capital.
Let's move to the next slide, and I'll embellish on that. We ended the quarter with 33 days. That's a 5-day improvement versus last year. That equates to about $325 million worth of cash. In fact if you go back to 2009 when we initiated the cash sustainability work, we were at 50 days in the second quarter. That's a 17-day improvement up to this quarter, which is equal to about $1.1 billion in cash. This is the 11th consecutive quarter that we showed year-over-year improvement, and it's across every one of our businesses. We expect to continue as we move forward.
Let's now move to our next slide. Just a few comments about this slide. As you can see, we show a historical view to show in the context since the recession occurred in late '08 and beginning '09 where our efforts around cash sustainability have really enabled us to even generate profitability in the face of volatile economic environment and significantly declining metal prices but more important, to continue to be -- put ourselves in a good liquidity position.
By showing you previously we got $1.7 billion of cash on hand, but we're also able to pay off $200 million of debt. We've increased our free cash flow to $246 million. You can see from this historical basis that we see a benefit coming out of the first quarter, which is usually a cash use of funds and we expect to be in our targeted range of 30% to 35% on debt to cap as we move forward and by the end of the year. So let me take a minute and summarize, if I could.
First of all about our annual targets and that's in the middle column, and the overarching target is to be positive free cash flow. So I'll start at the bottom with you. Maintaining the debt to cap at 30%, 35%; I told you that's our goal for the end of the year. 
If you take our expenditures, sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx in Saudi Arabia, that all adds up to $1.7 billion, and we're on track to achieve that expenditure level or be within that expenditure level. On both overhead and working capital, we're going to achieve both of those targets. 
And on productivity gains, just to give you an idea where we stand, we have put forward productivity gains of $800 million. We're through 6 months, we're already at $591 million for the year on a year-over-year basis, so tracking extremely well against that.
Klaus is going to elaborate further on how we're executing against our strategy. But if you just look at the second quarter results, we've continued to execute against the curtailments and try and drive down costs in our upstream operations. We're progressing well against our revenue targets in our midstream and downstream. And in fact, we've set records for first half margin on both midstream and downstream segments, so performing well against our liquidity goals, as well as our 3-year targets.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Klaus."

But overall, and I st",5099,"Well, Chuck, thank you very much. So why don't we start with -- in the usual fashion, where we look at our end markets and let's try to make it quick, as quickly as possible.
So the picture that we're seeing here is a mixed picture. But overall, and I stress it today, we see positive growth continuing in most of our end markets. 
So let's go through the segments and let's start with aerospace. Our view really has not changed. We expect 13% to 14% growth for this year. It's really driven by strong performance on the last commercial aircraft segment. Today, we see about 8,300 aircraft as a backlog. This is basically at today's production and 8 years backlog. That's pretty amazing.
We also see on the business jets side the confidence. We have come back. The recent single largest order in history that has ever been placed in the segment is the clear underlining for that group of net jets, facing an order of up to 425 business jets. But we also believe that the impact of the business jet segment is probably going to get compensated by the anticipated decline in the military aircraft side.
Let's move onto automotive as the next segment. We expect 4% to 8% growth on a global basis. This is on our projection, up slightly from 3% to 7%, which we actually projected for the year at the last quarter. And that's driven basically by North America, where we see and expect 10% to 14% growth. If you look at the June seasonally adjusted annual rates, it comes out with 14.05 million vehicles. This is up 22% year-over-year or 15% year-to-date. That's a pretty substantial number.
Europe is down minus 4% to minus 9%, and that's truly a function of the economic turmoil. China remains positive. We see 2% -- plus 2% to plus 7% despite a slow start in the year. 
Heavy trucks and trailer, mixed picture, down compared to the view that we had in the first quarter. North America is really driving it. We believe that heavy truck production will slow down in the second half of the year, and this will get production in line again with lower orders. We see plus 4% to plus 8% growth for the full year. That's lower than what we saw before in the first quarter.
But let's also remember if you look at the fact here, the average age of the fleet today is 6.69 years. That's the oldest on record. The 20-year average is 5.85. So obviously, there is a need for replacement at one point in time, and that is going to drive demand. 
For Europe, we continue to see declines. We project minus 3% to minus 8%. But for China, we revised our forecast from 0% to 5% growth to minus 3% to minus 8%. This is mainly driven by the delayed infrastructure spending, which is supposed to begin now in the third quarter of this year. And we believe the market in the second half is going to see a pickup.
Next segment, beverage, cans, and packaging. We continue to expect to do 3% global growth, driven by China, South America, Middle East, North Africa, Europe. Those are the main drivers basically of growth. And even in North America, always keep in mind North America always makes up for almost half of this segment. And we see early signs of improvement from your market segment. That's a good thing.
Commercial building and construction, globally we continue to project 2.5% to 3.5% growth. China, Brazil, India and other emerging countries are really the foundation for that. But if you look at North America and Europe, we continue to see this heavily under pressure. The most leading indicators are either flat or a near record low or even deteriorating. So no good news on that and so far when it comes to North America and Europe. 
Last segment here, industrial gas turbines. We're increasing our growth expectations to 3% to 5% from what we had originally in the last quarter 1% to 2%. And this is really driven by 2 factors: new builds, we see this increasing and an increased demand also for spare parts. And as an interesting fact piece, we've been talking about gas and somewhat -- some of the discussions that we had with some of you on the phone in April this year, the first time in the history of the EAI, the record keeping that gas and coal-fired power generation achieved the same market share here in the U.S., clear indication that something is happening there.
So this concludes basically the view on our end markets, so let's focus now on the question what does that all mean for our alumina market? And you see it here broken down by the different regional segments. The global aluminum demand continues to be strong. We said previously we believe it's going to grow by 7% this year, and we continue to maintain this view. And when you see where this is coming from, we actually see that China continues to grow substantially, 11% is our assumption here. Good demand growth also in other markets here from Asia, India, Middle East, North America, Brazil, Russia, those are main drivers, as you can see here from the chart. 
So the real question is what does that -- all the demand picture here on this page, what does that mean for the supply-demand situation? So let's start with the Alumina segment here. And as you can see depicted here, we believe Alumina is moving back into balance and this is really driven by 2 factors: One is the recently announced refinery curtailments in China, and we do expect higher alumina imports from China and we see some of that already. 
And why is that so? And we've seen as -- we put this here on the right-hand side because Indonesia has imposed a bauxite export ban. Keep in mind, 60% of the bauxite that is used in China, therefore, making alumina is imported. And 80% of that comes from Indonesia, so this is big news for the refinery industry in China.
And interestingly the exporters, from all our information tell us are really the export ban is really executed, so this has a 4-week time lag. But I mean we would see more of that. 
So far how it looks is not that easy to get an export license, that only 2 companies only have been granted a license. And one thing is very clear it's going to be more expensive, right? So there's going to be an export tax that is coming on top of it, if you get a license. And that export tax basically means you have $5 to $10 more per metric ton of bauxite, added to basically the already very expensive and high-cost refineries in China. So that is certainly not going to help the already quite questionable profitability of many of the refineries in China.
China has, and you see it down here in that chart on the stacked bars, has built an inventory. The inventory makes up to about 1 to 2 months, 5.9 million tons. We've also seen that up to May, the alumina imports have been substantially up by about 128%. So we also have seen that the Chinese announced refinery cuts as a reaction to the uncertain bauxite supply. And the real question is going to be how is it going to go forward with Indonesia? Are exports ever coming back? And I mean obviously, the market will have to watch that.
So let's move onto the next segment, the aluminum segment. And on the aluminum segment, we continue to see a deficit in aluminum. The curtailments are occurring. You see that here on the right-hand side. We basically put in here what we are seeing out there. We also see why don't we start -- let's start with the upper part of this table here, which is China. We are seeing that the expanding continues, but at a slower pace. And as we expected and said already in the first quarter, China is curtailing and they have curtailed about 1.2 million already since the end of last year. And we are estimating another 350,000 tons to come offline by the second half of this year. And the outlook is -- to China to be in the deficit of 350,000 tons this year.
Look at the rest of the world, which is a lower, the lower table there on the right-hand side. Demand, we believe, is going to increase by 3%. You saw that -- or you could calculate that from the slides that I showed you 2 slides before. But if you look at the production, the production is not keeping up with demand. Production is pretty much flat. And if you figure in the announced curtailments as we showed them here and the very fact that there's really no new capacity coming online in 2012, we expect a deficit.
You look at all of this, I want to make one thing crystal clear here, this -- the market is working, and we do see that people are moving forward with curtailing, are responding by slower build-out as we see in China. And I think that's clearly a function of the lower LME pricing situation that we currently have in the market.
So let's look at the typical premiums at the next slide. Well, I mean given the supply-demand fundamentals that I just showed you, I mean, you see what's going on here. It's really no surprise that the regional premiums continue to go up, right? That's what you see here. It's gone up substantially. They are a function of really 2 factors in the main: The one is physical demand, we talked about that; second thing is the attractiveness of aluminum as an asset class. And in today's very volatile world, this is a relatively risk-free return environment and people are recognizing that, and that's why their money is flowing in. 
So let's also take a look at the inventories, and let me apologize right away for this slide. But I hope you will like it as much as I do when I have a chance to go through it, but you have to bear with me because it's a little complex. 
Right, so let's start with what is depicted here in this mountain slide. What you do see here is a view of the global inventories from 2005 to today. And the layers that you see there are the different layers of inventory. But we have made a big effort to not just show the visible inventory here, but also show what's called the invisible inventory with a reasonable estimate, right? So that's what you see here in this mountain chart, as I call it, right? 
So first thing you notice is ""Wow, there was a peak in 2009."" Well, we all know that. But you also notice it has gone substantially down from the peak in 2009. And to be clear, it has come 27 days down from 2009, so that's a substantial decline. What you also notice is that it has continued to come down even now from between the first quarter and the second quarter. We've seen 3 days have been shaved off; it's now at 75 days. And at the end of the first quarter, it was at 78 days.
We also see something else, which I hope you will see. There is this little layer that has been building up, this thick yellowish layer, I hope it comes through on your PC. This thick yellowish layer on the absolute top and what that is, is a layer of what's called canceled warrants. And the canceled warrants are basically driven by a strong demand from the -- to finance metal and to use it, as I described it, as an asset class we held for a while, because it only makes sense to cancel the warrant if you really want to hold it for a while and move it off the LME exchange, right? That's a clear indication of the attractiveness of that, and also the trust in that market because people are moving it off the exchange to basically save storage costs. So that's what you see here too. 
And now the last thing that you see here, and that's also very interesting, focus on the top 3 yellow boxes that we have there. And let's start with the left box there. And the left box basically shows -- and by the way, you now have to also take a look at the blue line there. The blue line is the LME price, right? This is the LME 3-month price that we've laid -- layered over there.
And what you would expect, I mean the inventory builds up. You see an oversupply that leads to an inventory buildup. You basically that in the 2008 time frame. Oh yes, metal price goes down pretty substantially, right? Yes, that's clear. I mean, inventory builds up; oversupply, price goes down, right? 
Now we see a reverse when it comes off the peak there. Basically, inventory goes down. And yes, you do see metal price goes up, right? And there is obviously lag time in between a little bit there because people have certain expectations. So that's what you see there.
And then you go to the end of this period, which is now, and you do see something very odd there. You see that the inventory continues to come down, but the metal price substantially comes down, right? So that's an interesting phenomenon. The phenomenon pretty much starts around mid-2011. So we dug a little deeper into that phenomenon, and bear with me for -- I mean, I think 2 or 3 slides that I want to use here now.
Right. So let's forget about the inventory side -- slide for a moment, and let's go into what we really are talking about, and that is supply-demand balance, right? Because in the end, it's a question of do we have oversupply, do we have undersupply that drives price. We've all learned that, right? And this is what is depicted here in this slide, this slide goes back also to 2006.
And you see this period here, I mean you see that the bars here: If it's above 0, it's an oversupply situation; below, it's basically a deficit, right? Surplus or deficit, right? So when you see the blue line continues to be the LME 3 cash price here. So what you see here is exactly following the supply-demand logic. Very, very nicely you see when it goes up, price goes down; when it goes down, price goes up. And then comes the period here in 2011 where you suddenly see something else is happening. You see the market is going into a deficit. And at the same time, prices substantially fall.
So what happened in the middle of 2011? So I guess to find out what happened is we have to look at the macro environment because we can't find it in our market. So look at the macro environment, this is a standard chart. You've seen that before. It just has the new numbers added to it. When you look at some of those indicators, I would suggest the one that's giving you the most forward look is probably the Purchasing Managers' Index, right?
And if you look at the period at question here kind of -- I mean the mid-2011, you do see that something changes there. It looks as though there was a recovery underway. And then slowly, this thing starts sinking down. From then on, it goes up a little, it goes down and recently it's been weakening again.
So what we do see here, it's highly -- this Purchasing Managers' Index decline is highly driven by concerns over Europe and the sustainability of the Eurozone as we all know, and basically we hear it every day, right? This has also affected, as we saw on the last slide, the commodity prices, the metal prices. They've all come down also recently.
So we've done one other analysis, which I want to share with you. And then we're done with this part and we can focus on the company, right? But I think it's important to understand that. And there's 2 analyses that show what's going on here. The left-hand side, what we did here is we correlated the LME 3-month price with the Dow Jones-UBS commodity basket, right? And what you see here, and it's a 12-year analysis, basically you're starting at January '01. So it's a long time frame, right? 
And what you see here on the left-hand side, you see there's fluctuation, up and down, up and down. And you would expect that, because it basically means aluminum has its own dynamics. And they are -- they slowed up and down from the commodity basket because other commodities are different, right? 
The trending up that you see in general as the second effect here on the left-hand side, I would explain that by saying this is the time frame from 2001 on where people were starting to discover the commodity cycle, where people are starting to talk about wow, this is a commodity cycle. There's something fundamentally going on. Emerging markets are growing. 
But then you see this phase which is already starting kind of mid-2009 where suddenly this thing, the commodities swing in sync with aluminum, right, and a very, very tight range, very, very high correlations. And I must say today, I mean it almost seems like aluminum was in sync with our commodities, right?
Now our team made another analysis, which I found equally interesting after that one here, and that's shown here on the right-hand side. And that shows the correlation between the 3-month LME price and the S&P 500 Index, right, and same period -- same time period, 12 years time period almost. And you do see what you would expect to where there is really no correlation between the S&P 500 and the LME, because they are very, very different fundamentals. It swings in various directions. 
But then you see -- funny enough, at the same time period, this goes up. And if you see it today, I mean it's still not 1-on-1 correlated, it's 0.5. But substantially different from what we've seen before. And you see that the swings today, it swings -- even with the S&P 500 Index, it swings. So the real question is has the general economic sentiment currently overtaken the market fundamentals, right? And I guess there's really not much other than the answer to that is yes, right? 
So the question is well historically, I mean, what prevails, right? And that's why I wanted to remind you of the fundamentals, right? Because in the end, I believe the fundamentals prevail. And humankind always wants to explain certain phenomena and very often gravitates away from the fact, so that's why I want to remind us all of what are the facts in the aluminum market. We do see 7% growth this year, right? 
Secondly on the supply-demand picture, alumina we believe is balanced. We already see a tightness, meaning a deficit in aluminum. Inventories are declining substantially from the peak, 27 days from the peak, 3 days from the last quarter. Premiums are at a record high. So the fundamentals in the market are sound, right?
So that's really all wonderful, but I think the important message here is let's really -- and the more important message is we at Alcoa are driving our competitiveness no matter how the market is going to be, right? I think we've shown that through the whole crisis that we've seen from 2008 on. And that's what I want to focus the rest on because that is really the most important thing. And how are we doing that? How are we gaining our competitiveness? What business actions are we taking to make ourselves more future proof?
So let's start with the Alumina segment, right? And all in the Alumina, as well as the aluminum segment, one of the big things is we're focusing on improving our cost position. What you see here on the upper left-hand side is the current profitability has been impacted by price decline. We see cost headwinds, like fuel, oil and costs that can hit the refineries.
On the right-hand side, I mean the response clearly is we are going to come down on the cost curve. We said that we're going to come down 7 percentage points, and we believe that we're going to get 1 to 3 points shaved off by the end of 2013. Why do we believe that? Because the actions are in place. The curtailments that we announced, 390,000 tons here on the refining side are completed, right? And this is basically the Atlantic region. 
We have seen profits -- productivity gains of $270 million since the end of 2010. We are creeping production at our lower-cost facilities, basically the Western Australia, another $125 million of profit. 
We've come down on the days working capital by 7 days. That alone gives us $110 million in cash. And last but not least on that in Saudi Arabia, refinery and mine will be coming online. It's well underway, going to get online in 2014.
And let's talk about alumina pricing index, basically getting aluminum priced with the fundamentals. We believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot by the year end. 
On the Primary side, Primary Metals side, the upper-left side here, our Primary Metals business is substantially impacted by lower LME price. You see that here reflected in the profitability. What best defense do we have other than moving down on the cost curve? That's we -- what we're doing. We're going to take 10 percentage points off. We project that we're going to take 3 to 6 percentage points off by 2013. And why are we pretty sure that, that is working? Because the actions are in place.
Once Italy is completed, the curtailments will represent 40% of our global capacity. Add to that the permanent closures of 290,000 tons that are underway, Tennessee and Rockdale. That's another 6% of our capacity. 
Productivity gains, $310 million; monetizing Tapoco; 8 days of days working capital improvement; $235 million of cash, that is in Saudi Arabia; lowest-cost facility, on-time and on-budget coming online in 2013.
We are also using the value-add side here, and this is the cash cow in a much, much better way, by producing value of products like bar [ph], wire, rod, flap. And in the first half year alone, that has added 337 additional margin to our bottom line. 
So let's go to the midstream segment. On the midstream segment, or the Global Rolled Products segment, we've seen a record first half profitability with $409 per metric ton. You see the 10-year average is at $235. That's pretty phenomenal. The utilization has increased. We now have an 85% utilization, very strongly driven by the big segments, aerospace, auto and packaging here. And I think there's also comfortable room to grow at an incrementally higher margin level.
On the left-lower side, we see how we're tracking against our revenue targets. Remember, $2.5 billion by 2013. We believe that we can get to 67% of our growth target in on an LME normalized basis in this year, by the end of this year.
Aero and auto, I talked about that and will talk a little bit more about it. Productivity gains $215 million -- $218 million. Saudi Arabia is on time, on budget, coming online 2013; set out 7 days of working capital. That's again $140 million of additional cash. 
Engineered Products and Solution achieved another record quarter. They're moving from record to record. I think Chuck mentioned that already, $276 million EBITDA, record EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and that includes even the Massena outage.
But they've basically use the time of the crisis to reposition the portfolio in the downturn, and now they are growing and showing quarter-over-quarter improvement and that's really very, very good to see. 
The utilization is up in aerospace as well. As for the rest, we are on track to meet our revenue target, it's $1.6 billion, that is up to next year. 63% of that we believe we're going to get this year. Productivity, nice. I mean EPS in general is a strong platform before profitable growth. We've got a lot on getting innovations and share gains through that, $1 billion out of the $1.6 billion target comes from that. 
So let me finish with reminding you of 2 important developments in our end markets that give you a feel for what's going on there, all right? Let's start with automotive. And here on the left-hand side you see a pretty amazing slide, and that is it goes back to 1975, right, and projected until 2025. And that really tells a nice story, because it shows the pounds of aluminum per vehicle. And you see that this is an ongoing story of alumina in the industry, right?
Heat exchangers, wheels, heads, blocks, hoods and now the next frontier, it's clear, it's doors and body in white.  And the market preference is also clear. People are going for higher fuel efficiency. And the general emissions regulation is helping the new CAFE rules here in the U.S., 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, 54.5 by 2025. There's a broad-based trend going on here, and it's not just any more reserved to a luxury or top line segment, but it's going through all segments and it's covering the volume segment. That's why be believe in the North America, we would see a demand increase of 60% by 2025.  Aluminum sheet use will triple by 2015. 
We are very well positioned to capture this demand, we've just left $300 million in Davenport to expand Davenport, ready for the automotive market. And the good news is this is supported by secured orders. 
Saudi Arabia will include an auto body sheet manufacturing capability, and we are evaluating further expansion, given that situation in this market. 
Aerospace is the second market I want to put a little word in here and after all, 50% of the Engineered Products and Solution revenues are generated there and there are exciting opportunities. Why is it exciting? I already talked about this thing that depicted here on the left-hand side, 8 years auto backlog. And when you look forward, you basically see travel demand is up. People project it to be 5% up over the next 20 years. The fleet is aging, so people are basically -- experts are saying there's going to be demand for 35,000 new planes, and they are talking about 1,842 -- I mean note that the precision of that forecast of planes every year. 
So that's why we are putting a lot of effort into innovating and improving our position in this market and gaining share through innovation. And let me just briefly close here with showing you 3 of the more recent ones that we've come in. Fasteners that are solving lighting strike issues, you'd say, ""Why is that an issue?"" Well, it's an issue because statistically every plane gets it at least once during their lifetime, by lightning strike. And as some airplanes are going into nonconductive carbon fiber solution, I mean this is a very critical question of how do you get the lightning strike managed. And that's where the fasteners come in, and they have solved this problem for our customers, right? 
The good news is not only did they solve that, but they actually solved another problem, too, and that's the fatigue problem. That particularly covers in the more different materials you combine. Because always keep in mind, airplanes are going up and down in the air. On the ground, they have currently here in New York about 100 Fahrenheit. And up in the air at 30,000 feet, they have sub-zero and they do it a couple of times during the day. So that's a great, great innovation that we've been able to do there. 
There's a next -- second example, there's a next-generation of turbines coming in that are much more efficient, 15% more fuel efficient, 50% less emissions, and I could go on and on and on. Why is that possible? A major enabler, our technologies that we are putting in place here: Multi-Wall/3D Airfoil Cooling Schemes. And they direct the air to get the air to the critical areas, because these turbines are operating at temperatures that are above the melting point of the materials inside of the turbine. There's -- the metals that the turbine blades are made of. Keep in mind also, this is not aluminum. This is typically nickel alloys that we're using there. We are talking about the downstream side of things.
Single Crystal another one, melting point increase of 12%, substantial. Thin Airfoil Equiax Process getting blade weights down by 20%. They're beautiful, beautiful innovation all along there.
The last thing that I want to mention is a third-generation aluminum lithium, together with advanced structural concepts. And this alone we feel is capable of shaving 6% to 10% of the weight off of an aircraft and double the time of the inspection intervals and increase passenger comfort. These innovations do capture the attention of our customers and here on the right-hand side, you see the key OEMs and it's really in my view, no surprise that we are working very, very closely pretty much with everyone of those. 
So let me sum it up and then open it up for questions. We basically have solid market fundamentals; strong aluminum demand, 7%; supply and demand balance or in a deficit. We are focusing on improving our competitiveness, coming down on the cost curve in the upstream profitable growth and the midstream, as well as on the downstream. And we're tracking well here for this year to reach our targets. And then there are exciting things in it for our future, 2 exciting markets I talked about, automotive, aerospace and there's more. 
So all of this will continue to make us stronger going forward and we'll manage through whatever the environment has in it for us. So let's now open the lines and take some questions."

I appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Let's start off with the financial overview for the quarter. Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share, and if you exclude the impact of restructuring and special items, it gives us an income from continuing operations of $32 million or $0.03 per share. 
Our revenue, EBITDA and ATOI all decreased sequentially primarily due to lower LME prices. It's important to note that even though the EBITDA fell to $282 million, adding back the non-cash special items would place EBITDA at $496 million in the quarter. 
So with that being said, taking a step back, how did we perform in the quarter? We had strong performance in all 4 of our segments. We take a look at the upstream segments, Alumina and Primary, excluding the impact of LME and currency, combined -- the combined segments of Alumina Primary generated $98 million of performance sequentially, and both the Global Rolled Products segment and the Engineered Products and Solutions segment set records in the third quarter. Let me go through a few of those. 
In GRP, we had record third quarter ATOI. We had record third quarter days working capital; we had record year-to-date ATOI, and we had a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton. If you switch over to our Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had record third quarter ATOI, record quarterly EBITDA margin, record year-to-date ATOI and record year-to-date EBITDA margins. 
Obviously, our segments performed extremely well. Taking a look at our core and consolidated basis, we had a record load days working capital for the third quarter of 33 days, 5 days better than a year ago. Debt-to-capital remained at 36.1%, and our net debt to capital stood at 32.4. Our liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.4 billion, and I'll point out that, that excludes $224 million of restricted cash. We had a bond issuance during the quarter or tax-exempt bonds of 30 years issued, and that cash is for the Davenport expansion and is going to stay restricted in order to pay for that expansion. 
Okay, with that being said, let's take a look at the income statement. Just going to cover 3 items on the income statement: First, revenue. Revenue was down 2% sequentially, driven by lower realized metal prices and weakness in commercial transportation and industrial markets for our Global Rolled Products, and nonresidential building and construction and commercial transportation markets for Engineered Products and Solutions. 
COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially 390 basis points, driven primarily by the environmental and litigation reserves, as well as a lower LME. And lastly, on this sheet, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.9%. If you exclude discrete items, our operational year-to-date rate is 29%. We would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we'll continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility our profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.  So our results for the quarter, as I said, was $0.13 loss excluding -- including special items. 
So let's move on to those special items in the next slide. Special items for the quarter totaled $175 million or $0.16 a share. Let's start out with the environmental reserves. Environmental reserves were increased for 4 sites in the third quarter to reflect the revised cost estimates, of which Grasse River was the largest. On October 1, the EPA released the proposed remedial action plan, with a recommended capping and dredging solution of $243 million. This culminated a 20-year process, which included comprehensive scientific studies to evaluate and determine the recommended approach. It's estimated that the planning and design will take 2 to 3 years, and that will be followed by 4 years of remediation, beginning in 2016. 
The next item on reserves was the litigation reserve at $40 million pretax and $15 million after tax. During the quarter, we reached a settlement of the Alba civil suit in the amount of $85 million, 1/2 was paid today, the other half will be paid one year from now. We recorded $40 million charge this quarter in addition to the $45 million charge we recorded in the second quarter. We believe the settlement represents the best possible outcome and avoids the time and expense of complex litigation. 
Alcoa and Alba have also entered into an ATI-based, long-term alumina supply agreement. Resumption of commercial relationship demonstrates the desire to work together, as well as the significant value that Alcoa brings to customers in the region with superior quality and optimal logistics of its alumina. 
The $26 million in discrete tax item relates to the interim treatment of losses in jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit. And then we had mark-to-market energy contracts and restructuring charges in the quarter as well. All told, it's $175 million or $0.16 a share of special items, and excluded, it brings our income from continuing operations to $0.03 a share. 
Let's move on to the sequential bridge. Our income from continuing operations decreased from $61 million to $32 million or down $29 million sequentially. Obviously, the unfavorable market impact was driven by lower LME prices and unfavorable currency. The A dollar strengthened and was partially offset by weakening of the Brazilian real. The $21 million of net cost increases were more than overshadowed by the favorable price mix and productivity in the quarter of $86 million. The cost increases were largely a result of LIFO accrual, which reflected the rebound in metal prices. 
We also continued strong productivity across Alumina, Primary Metals and EPS businesses this quarter, driven by higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates, usage reductions and reduced contractual spending. So if you look at the $94 million of market impact and you were to take the net impact of all of the items and deem them to be performance of $65 million, you will see that we were able to eliminate 70% of the market impact to improve performance, strong performance from an operating basis. 
Let's move on now and take a look at each one of the segments. Let's start with the Alumina segment. Production was up 1% as the Australian maintenance overhauls were completed in the second quarter. Shipments were up as a result of the increased production, as well as the tons that were shipped this quarter that were delayed at the end of last quarter. 
So if you looked at the operating -- after-tax operating loss of $9 million, it's down $32 million sequentially, driven by price reductions which impacted earnings by $91 million and $11 million in unfavorable currency. 
Offsetting a major portion of the negative market impact of $102 million was $70 million of favorable performance, driven by price mix, productivity and volume. Productivity gains were $23 million. Price mix, a piece of that was driven by API improvement as the Alumina Price Index prices remained flat while the LME declined. 
So here again as you look at this segment, you see that 70% of the market impact was reduced by improved performance of $70 million. Looking to fourth quarter guidance in this segment, pricing on Alumina Price Index at 40% of third-party shipments, while other pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Caustic prices are expected to remain flat. API pricing has remained flat as the LME has recently increased since early September, and productivity gains are expected to continue. 
Let's move on to the Primary segment. Revenue is down slightly as higher third-party shipments will partially offset the impact of lower LME prices. LME prices were down 7% sequentially on a 15-day lagged basis, with realized prices down 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. 
The after-tax net operating loss of $14 million is from a $3 million in the second quarter for an $11 million reduction. Cutting first with lower LME prices and currencies combined the impacted ATOI $38 million negatively. Price mix was a favorable improvement and was driven mostly through regional premiums. In raw materials, we had higher alumina costs and improving coke and pitch prices. And here as in alumina, the performance of $27 million offset 70% of the market deterioration of $38 million. 
If you look to the fourth quarter guidance, pricing will continue to follow the 15-day lag and anticipate the U.S. hydro asset sale to be completed by the end of the quarter. We will continue productivity gains. Curtailments will unfavorably impact the fourth quarter ATOI by $15 million. So if you take back and take a step back and look at Alumina and Primary in total, we would expect, excluding LME, currency and the curtailment impact, that the upstream segments on a combined basis would remain flat on a sequential basis. 
Let's move to the Global Rolled Products segment. Revenue was down $64 million or 3% sequentially, driven by weaker industrial and commercial transportation markets in Europe. ATOI was $98 million for the quarter, a $3 million sequential improvement and a 63% improvement over third quarter 2011. Price mix was a $19 million improvement, more than offset cost increases and lower volumes. I'd like to point out and remind you what we went through last time, and that was a part of the price mix as driven by customer pricing flowing through on a 15- to 30-day period, and inventory cost of metal comes to in 45- to 90-day basis so you'd expect compressed margins on falling metal price and increased margins on rising prices. 
Cost increases consisted of metal premiums, labor and energy. I think it's important to take time out to look at the records of Global Rolled Products in this quarter. We had record third quarter ATOI of $98 million and adjusted EBITDA of $395 a ton. It's the highest ever year-to-date ATOI of $289 million. 
Year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton was a record at $405 per ton, 72% higher than the 10-year average. Also a record third quarter days working capital, down 5 days on a year-over-year basis. As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect aerospace and automotive to continue to be strong. We will see a seasonal demand decrease in packaging. European and North American industrial markets had been weakening, and we have had a corresponding pricing and demand pressures as a result of that. 
Excluding the impacts of LME and currency, ATOI is expected to be down 20% to 25% sequentially due to the continuation of weaker industrial markets and the seasonal impact of packaging. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions segment. EPS continues its string of strong quarters. ATOI of $160 million is a record third quarter despite the decreased revenue. Third-party revenue was down 4% sequentially due to seasonal declines in European building and construction and weakness in commercial transportation. 
EPS continues its sequential productivity gains of $13 million in the third quarter, which more than offset higher costs in transportation, energy and maintenance. Here again, we had records in this segment: record quarterly EBITDA margin at 20.3%; record year-to-date ATOI of $475 million and record year-to-date EBITDA margin of 19.6%. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, in the nonresidential building and construction business, we anticipate continued weakness particularly in Europe. Heavy-duty truck build rates are expected to continue their decline in North America and Europe cap. As is known for the EPS segment, we anticipate continued share gains and productivity improvements. 
If you look back over the last few years, the fourth quarter is generally a slower quarter than the third by about 13% from profitability standpoint. Due to productivity gains and shared gains offsetting weaknesses in commercial transportation and building and construction markets, we would expect a similar percentage decrease this year. 
Let's move to the cash flow statement. Let's start with cash from operations. $263 million cash from operations in the quarter led to a negative free cash flow of $39 million. If you looked at the second quarter, cash from operations was $537 million and there's really 3 main reasons for the decline from second quarter to third quarter. One is obviously the lower earnings. The second is interest payments as we make semiannual interest payments in the first and third quarter, and the third is the tax refund that we garnered in the second quarter of $70 million, which did not recur in the third quarter. Those 3 were partially offset by an improvement in working capital in the quarter. 
Something the pension contributions, they totaled $163 million in the quarter for a total of $515 million year-to-date, and that represents more than 90% of the total 2012 estimated payments. We anticipate a fourth quarter contribution in the range of $50 million, and right now, we're looking at contributions for 2013 to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. 
On a liquidity basis, as I said earlier, our debt-to-cap was at 36.1, and our net debt-to-cap was 32.4. Cash remains strong with $1.4 billion on hand, and we had 5-day improvement in days working capital. So let's switch now and look at the days working capital slide on the next page. 
This is something that we're very proud of inside of the company because 33 days working capital is a record low for the third quarter. In fact, the reason we're proud of it is this is the 12th consecutive quarter we've demonstrated year-over-year improvement. 
To give you a sense of what this is worth in terms of dollars, this 5-day improvement is worth about $315 million, and if you were to go back to the 2009 timeframe and these initiatives geared up, the 15-day improvement and that's worth about $1 billion and we expect this trend to continue. 
Let's move on to the next slide please. As we look at this quadrant of slides here, we like to point out that liquidity and how we've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet even in a volatile economic environment. First, let me reiterate that Alcoa's committed to our investment grade status. That's why we're in the fourth year now of the Cash Sustainability Program that's allowed us to remain profitable and maintain a stable balance sheet in a very volatile economic environment, as I said. 
We've got $1.4 billion of cash on hand, and I will point out again that, that doesn't include $224 million in restricted cash that we have, and we expect to be within our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 35% by year end. So let me take this and summarize it for you now. 
First of all, we're delivering on improvements to performance. We're executing the curtailments that we talked about in our Upstream business as we're moving down the cost curve, and we're also generating significant productivity in the upstream in order to move down the cost curve. At the same time, we're setting both quarterly and annual records on margin and profitability in the mid and downstream businesses. 
If you look to our annual targets, first with productivity, give you a sense of where we stand. Our productivity target this year, which is a before-tax number of $800 million, through the first 9 months, we've got $838 million of before-tax productivity gains on a year-over-year basis. 
I wanted to save another $50 million in overhead. Through the first 9 months, we're at $57 million. We wanted to be an additional 1.5 days down of working capital, and through the third quarter, we're 5 days better than the third quarter last year, and we anticipate that we will achieve this 1.5 days by year end balance. Debt capital spending investments of $1.7 billion and we will be within that limit at year end. 
Our debt-to-cap, we will fall within the 30% to 35% range, and most importantly, we anticipated that, that we will target that we will have free cash flow -- positive free cash flow this year, and based on where we stand right now, we still have that target that we're set to achieve for this year. 
So if you look at it, we're achieving our 1- and 3- to 5-year targets by moving down the coast curve in the upstream segments and generating top line growth and increasing margins in our mid and downstream segments. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Klaus."

So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.

So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets. 
Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture but we continue to see positive growth basically in most of our end markets. Global Aerospace remains solid at approaching to 40% growth. We are pretty confident in our confidence is supported by the continued strong performance in the large commercial aircraft segment. I've said it multiple times but the backlog is now 8,500 planes, and that is basically in today's production, about an 8-year backlog so this is solid. 
Next one is automotive. We have a microphone problem, no? Okay, the next one is automotive. In the automotive markets, we are seeing an increase of 11% to 15% in North America. It's very interesting. When the September seasonally adjusted sales rate came out at 14.9 million cars, this marks the highest selling rate since March 2008, which is basically a plus 15% on a year-to-date basis that's on top of it plus 15% we saw on a year-to-date basis compared to 2011 so that's a very positive development. 
Automotive in Europe continues to decline, we believe, at minus 4% to minus 9%. China feels a bit more stable in the automotive segment. The sales are up on a year-over-year basis 9%, and we expect a plus 4% to 7% growth this year. 
So next segment, heavy trucks and trailer. We have lowered our expectations in each of the markets so that globally, we expect a decline of minus 7% to minus 9%, so it's substantially down from the minus 3% to the plus 1% that we expected in the second quarter here. 
Let me go through it. On the North American sides, we've seen the net orders in heavy trucks and trailers fall in the first quarter to the second quarter by 23%, and then again from the second to the third quarter by another 13%. Obviously, the truck OEMs have reduced their production in response to that and we see a decline from the second to the third quarter of 18%. 
Interestingly, when you take a total look at the North American heavy truck picture, up to August and that's the only time that we have numbers, demand for freight was positive up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis. So was the truck load rates, they were up 2.4%. That's interesting. At the same time, the truck fleet is pretty old at 6.6 years now. The 20-year average is at 5.8 so there is a replacement pressure. 
But when we took a little bit of a deeper look, we saw that particularly the smaller and the medium-sized operators are concerned. I mean, the message is like fiscal cliff, euro news, China. All of that influenced their sentiment and I guess that, that makes them push their orders out kind of in anticipation of potentially a worry about the future. 
On the European heavy trucks and trailers outside the registration estimates for the third quarter are down 18% from the second quarter. The OEMs here, we believe, are reducing production, we expect a minus 8% to minus 11%. 
China, heavy trucks and trailer registrations fell by 17% from the second -- from the first quarter to the second, and August and July even looked worse with a minus 31% below the second quarter so we see production cuts here off the OEMs of around minus 24% from the second to the third quarter. 
So next segment is beverage can packaging. We've done what revised our growth expectations for Europe and China but global growth basically stays at the same 2% to 3%, and that's possible given the relative size of these other markets compared to North America, and North America has actually pretty good and actually looked a little better than what we originally expected. 
Last but not least, our outlook for commercial building and construction as well as industrial gas turbines remains unchanged. On the commercial building and construction, it's probably worthwhile to say a few words on the U.S. side. Commercial building index is hovering around the midpoint, and the recent number on August turned positive, but before, there were 4 months down and that was preceded by 5 months up so you get a feel for it, it's a pretty fragile environment. And on top of it, Architectural Building Index is a nice early indicator but always keep in mind, it takes 12 to 15 months after this really becomes billings and revenues in the market so it's preceding a very, very early one. 
So much on the building and construction side. On industrial gas turbines, probably one last sentence here. We continue to view the segment as very positive and strongly supported by the increased attractiveness of gas. 
So that basically concludes our view on the end market side. Let's now take a look at what does that all mean for the aluminum demand. And we do see a slight slowdown in some regions and end markets and puts a little pressure on the demand growth, so we've lowered our demand projection for this year to 6%, down one percentage points from the 7% that we saw before. 
Main driver for this is China. We saw in the first half of the year a demand growth of 11%. We believe this is going to come down in the second half of 7%, so you see here the average of this to basically gets to 9%. And at the same time, I am pretty confident, given the already announced China stimulus package, which is going into the ground, I mean, literarily speaking as we speak here, that the demand will be picking up speed but this is probably going to take until the end of the fourth quarter, so by that time, we will probably be able to see that in the numbers. 
Other than China, outside of China, basically, Europe has weakened here, and relatively spoken the other bright spots of growth are U.S. as well as Middle East. So what does that all of that mean now for the demand and supply picture so let's bring on the next slide. See on the left-hand side, you see the Alumina. On the right-hand side, the aluminum. And you can already see by the numbers here where the sheer size of the numbers or how small these numbers are demand that no matter where exactly they are. I mean, we basically see the markets both are pretty in balance. 
On the left-hand side, the Alumina market, if you compare it with what we have before moves into a slight surplus, and that's very much driven by China. We see lower production in China now but we do see higher imports on the Alumina side. Imports are up 192% year-over-year. And keep in mind this is very strongly driven by the Indonesia bauxite ban. 60% of the bauxite in China gets imported, 80% of that used to come from Indonesia. Now it's not coming from there. 
What we saw here if you move to the right-hand side of the aluminum side, the Chinese aluminum market. We see some smelter expansion getting delayed. And at the same time also build up of the alumina reserve. And why do I say that as we're talking on the right-hand side with aluminum? Because what you see here is smelters are basically currently building a reserve on the alumina supply, given the uncertainty of the bauxite respective Alumina supply situation and the lasting that they want they want don't want to be caught by surprise and having to slow down or shut down their smelters. 
So with all that, with the slowdown of demand, China moves into a slight surplus here. The rest of the world remains in a deficit. Demand have declined a bit, but at the same time, we see some production losses as well delays in new projects. So what does that all mean? The aluminum market also is moving or continues to be in a balance. 
So let's also take a look at the regional premiums on the next slide. So what you see here is basically depiction of the regional premium over time, and they are up and this is clearly an indication of the strength of the financial as well as the physical demand that drives tightness in the physical market. The regional premiums continued to rise, this another third consecutive quarter, and they have as you see here reached new record highs. 
So let's move on to the inventory side. I know and I've heard that feedback from outside. This is a complex chart so hang in with me. I'll run through you through this. It's actually not as complex as it looks. Let's first take a look at the mountain. The mountain that you see here is basically the stacking up of visible as well as inventory -- as well as invisible inventories. Obviously, that's an estimate, right, of the invisible inventory. 
When you look at the peak point of that mountain and look at where it is today, you actually see that the inventories have declined, in fact, 27 days from their peak in 2009. Compared to last quarter, it's pretty much flat at 75 days of consumption. 
Let me also point out one other thing here in the structure of the mountains, there's this strongly yellow-ish top here on the right-hand side which is called cathode warrants. And as you can nicely see, this has increased. So this is showing the desire of people wanting to get their metal off the exchange. In a way, it's a good indication for the financial deals and top of optimism there in regards to the financials demand here in the mid as well as the long-term staying attractive. 
The curve that we have in here, the blue curve that you have in here, I haven't talked about that. That's the LME price and as most of you guessed that. So now you have to -- now you have to put in perspective the mountain together with where the LME is going. And classical supply and demand logic would indicate, as you see here in the earlier part of that slide, as the mountain builds, the price comes down. The mountain goes down, price goes up. That's exactly how the market is supposed to work. That's basically in the mid-2011, you do see the market kind of comes down and the price really, really strongly. So what is happening here, why is there this decoupling of the supply and demand side? And that's on the next slide. 
What you see here is the bar is basically is the net, the supply and demand balance, so to say, and the curve here is an even more granular LME cash curve in that timeframe. So obviously, as the blue bars move up, the metal price comes down. I mean, oversupply, price comes down so clear. The blue bars go down, metal price goes up. And here again, you can see in the mid-2011, these fundamentals seem to get disconnected. And so demand supply base fundamentals are basically decoupling from the LME pricing. So real question is what is driving the LME then if it's not the fundamentals. And you've seen some of that very nice in the next slide. 
So in times of crisis, obviously, that's not the first time that markets are seeing that. Macro factors can top the fundamentals. And obviously, that's the thing that's happening. Worries around the Eurozone crisis, U.S. debt, fiscal cliff, China slowdown worries. All of that goes in and that's why we've seen metal price coming down from the $2,800 high in April last year to a low in summer of this year of $1,800, and that's only happened in a little more than a year timeframe. 
But it's also interesting to note that these things can very, very quickly reverse as we've recently seen. And we've recently seen this year. This is under the magnifying glass here. We've seen the LME shoot up to $2,200 per metric ton from $1,800 per metric ton so basically just in 10 days, it's shot up. And why did it shoot up? I mean, there were basically 4 announcements that made it shoot up. One was the ECB bond buying program. Preceding that was all the news around will it happen, will it happen, will it happen? That's why you see it coming up but then bowled it comes and shoots up. 
Next thing China stimulus plan, next thing, the German Constitutional Court ruling, and next thing, the QA3 announcement and wow, it's like a booster here, it shoots up. Nothing of that has changed anything of the fundamentals in our markets, right? So that's what you can clearly see here, the macro factors are currently dominating the pricing situation but it can reverse very, very quickly as we have seen there. 
So let me summarize the market side of things. So the market fundamentals are pretty much intact. We see the market effectively imbalanced. On the supply demand side, premiums remain at a record high. Inventories are down but currently, the market sentiment dominates the pricing. So that concludes the market price. 
Let's now move into our businesses and review our businesses. And let's start with alumina. And let's start on the upper left-hand side where you see the 10-year profitability. And you see it, it is a lower profitability at this point in time, and that's normal because it reflects the market conditions. But also, I think our actions have allowed us to at least return a profitability on a year-to-date basis. 
Why is that so? Part of it you see on the right upper-hand side because we have changed the pricing. We've changed it from an LME linkage to something that is really more in tune with the fundamentals of this market, which we call Alumina Pricing Index. And we've said that we are not going to sign any contracts based on that old scheme and that's what we stick by. So by the end of this year, we believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot basis. 
It's also clear and you see that again reflected on the lower left-hand side. This is a commodity business. So it's all about where you are on the cost curve. We're not that badly positioned here being on the 30s percentile. What we want to move down 7 percentage points by 2015 to the 23rd percentile. And we believe our actions are going to get us 1 to 3 percentage points down by the end of next year. So how are we going to do that? I mean, obviously all a lot of that is already in the making. We have curtailed and that's complete 390,000 tons basically in our Atlantic region refinery system. We continue to drive productivity, $320 million since 2010. 
A major factor here is the thing that we call centers of excellence and mining and refining. They have one task only, they detect the best practice and they roll it through the system in record speed so that we can really capture the productivity that we generate at all places. 
And in addition, cash management, well done, 8 days further down on days working capital, which means $150 million in cash. And then last but not least, Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget. And let me also remind you that this is lowest on the cost curve. 
So let's move on to the next segment, the Aluminum or Primary Metals segment. The weakness here in pricing has divorced from the fundamentals of the aluminum industry, and that continues to challenge the segment. Our strategy however is and that holds through basically the whole Upstream business we focus on the things that we can control to maximize value. 
So one of the things that we can control, for instance, is the value-add side here, which basically means optimizing our profitability. What we've done here in a very systematic way, we're offering our customer value-add products and we're capturing premiums so why we're limiting the logistics cost, and that alone has allowed us to add $375 million additional margin that's very, very good. 
Why we do that, obviously, the biggest thing here given that, that's a commodity business is pushing the cost down on the cost curve, 10 percentage points on the 51st percentile, to the 41st percentile by 2015, that's our target, and we believe that we're going to get 3 to 6 percentage points out of the system by 2013. 
A lot of actions are going on, and those that follow us more closely clearly see that. We have restructured our high costs so we are in the process of restructuring our high-cost assets permanently closed 290,000 tons in Tennessee and Rockdale and partially curtailed Aviles and La Coruña in Spain, high-cost smelters in Spain, and we are moving forward with the curtailment of Italy. More than 70% of our smelter is currently closed. This is one of the highest cost measures in our whole system. Once all of this is complete, which will be soon, 14% of our global smelting system is curtailed. 
Productivity gains in addition to that $385 million. We have also been able and this quarter shows it in a very nice way to improve our cost of power. This is a major factor here in the cost structure. In the U.S., in Australian and Brazil, in Australian and Brazil, where the great cooperation from the government to help us to remain competitive in this market. In addition to that, strong focus also on the cash side. 9 days out from days working capital equals $240 million in cash. And Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget. 
The third segment here is our Global Rolled Products, and they continue to show strong performance, and they have achieved a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton, $405 per metric ton. Just look at that compared to where the 10-year average is of $235 per metric ton. They're really performing on a different performance level. 
In addition to that, they show solid growth in many segments like automotive, aerospace on a year-over-year basis. Also strong demand on the North American packaging side. The utilization of 85% where we are today there's room to grow. 
Talking about growth. We are preparing for additional growth in the automotive segment. I'll talk about that at the very end a little bit. Our Davenport expansion is the biggest factor here is on time, on budget, and we will be able to roll the first car off in the end of December of 2013. 
At the same time, we continue to move our existing business, productivity gains of $280 million, and we focus also here on the cash, 3 days of working capital out will give us additional $60 million. Compared to 2010, it's actually 5 days if you compare it to last year. 
Our fourth segment is the Engineered Products and Solutions business, and that achieved another record quarter. We now have an EBITDA margin that's above 20%, besides 20.3% in the third quarter. That's excellent performance. 
You look at the upper right-hand side, on the aerospace side, our utilization remained at 78%, and on the other businesses, due to the weakness on the commercial transportation as well as building and construction, it's down from 69% to 65% compared to the last, last, last quarter here. 
The lower left-hand side there, that's a complicated one but I tell you what it depicts. I mean, we are continuing to drive innovation. And when Airbus earlier this year came to us to introduce a very, very cool concept, you see depicted here, this is the thing that tips up the end of the wing and gives a massive, massive fuel efficiency improvements, we developed with the new patented alloy. That alone allows 3.7% higher strength-to-weight ratio, which results in a fuel burn reduction of 3.5%. That's great. 
And that's not the only thing that happened on the innovation front and equally great one is the other one that's depicted here. This is a very, very interesting new turbine, new jet engine by Pratt and Whitney called The Gear Turbine Fan. And we have been able to place our ultra-efficient lightweight made of aluminum lithium in there. And obviously, this type of innovations driven by very, very strong also innovation on the fundamental metal side driving share gains and growth, and that is part of the strength of our downstream business, and we will continue to do it and leverage our core advantages in that. 
At the same time, they are not letting go on the productivity side. You see the productivity gains here of $350 million since 2010, very, very well done. 
So that concludes the business side. But before I conclude the presentation entirely, let me also do one deep dive here on the automotive front because that is fascinating thing that changes there. Many of you might have heard here in the U.S. finally, we also are focusing in the U.S. year on fuel efficiency. Regulation has come up here called new CAFE regulation Corporate Average Fuel Economy. You see that depicted here on the left-hand side. The firms are forced to get up 31% and double their fuel efficiency of their fleet. That's what the automotive companies are legislated to. 
At the same time and that's the middle part here, consumer behavior is shifting. In 2008, if you looked at the consumer surveys, 54% of the potential buyers of cars would have said, ""I'm willing to pay more for fuel efficiency."" This number is now up to 83%. So basically pretty much everybody says, I mean, ""I'm willing to pay more for more fuel efficiency."" This is obviously also driven by the rising fuel prices that has accelerated, I mean, really during that timeframe. 
And actually is even more interesting when you look at how many people are ranking this, even as their #1 factor for buying and it's 37% that rated as the #1 buying decision and that's across the business segments. So the car companies have been followed up on that and that's why you see that they're offering fuel efficient choices pretty much in all segments. 
So both of these changes, I mean, the legislation change as well as the consumer demand change, both of those drive light weighting and drive to get more aluminum into cars drive for substitution with other materials. There's been a study out recently that basically shows that this light weighting as an answer to these questions is a very, very cost-effective solution for the automotive company. That's why we are seeing what we're seeing. 
In addition to that, this allows changes to be done without any compromise on the safety side. Recently again, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration reconfirmed that light weighting is a choice that allows for the same safety. That's a great thing here. That's a real winner and that's why you see here on the right-hand side believe demand is going to increase 4x by 2016 and going to increase 7.5x by 2020. That's why the expansion in Davenport, which I talked about before, is so important and that's also why our Middle Eastern project will have an automotive capacity in it. 
So let's go to the last slide here. So let me summarize. The industry fundamentals are solid but the macro sentiment basically dominates. We are delivering strong results, we are controlling our own destiny and we're not standing still. Upstream, $98 million in performance improvement. We're restructuring our high-cost assess on the midstream, the Global Rolled Products side, record performance, record profitability per metric ton. On the Engineered Products and Solutions business, our downstream business, highest EBITDA margin ever with 20.3%. In addition to that, good cash management, record low third quarter days working capital. And on the right-hand side, I just gave you one deep dive here in the automotive market. We continue to aluminize different industries, and that's a good thing. 
And let me close here. We don't want to stop our aluminization strategy, so to say, here on earth. We are very proud that we have been part of NASA's curiosity role with just landed on Mars. This really connects well to the vision of our founders and enabling mankind's biggest dreams, and that's also very much in line with our vision advancing each generation. 
So that said, let me open the line for questions."

That's a good question and I know that we have talked with those that follow us a lot, we've talked about it quite a bit but I'm happy to give you a high-level overview. First thing is I mean, we don't see any kind of rocks that should remain unturned or that should not be questioned. Everybody knows that the business that we have does not, by definition, belong into our portfolio. We actually put it on a test and say we have to prove for every business that we have that we are a better parent to that business than anybody else. And that basically brings out the question of what can Alcoa add in the business as an Alcoa advantage. And the answer to that, I mean, are multi-fold. I mean, in principle, you see it coming in through technology, you see it in through procurement. It comes in through customer intimacy, customer reach through the talent management that we have, to the operating system. That's how we can generate value. And basically, you see it very, very nicely in the performance of that we have been able to generate in the downstream as well as the midstream business and how we are performing against bringing the upstream business down on the cost curve. So that's basically where we are on that. And I can go into all kinds of examples here. I mean, I could just take out the examples that I used here in my presentation today. I mean, on the EPS business, for instance, the 2 examples on Airbus as well as on Pratt and Whitney. In both cases, these innovations were new alloys. The alloys were not developed in the downstream business. The alloys were developed there where we have the best alloy experts, which is basically in our center. This is how we leverage technology as an example. Now you go to the upstream side and take an example out of this quarter. I mean, this quarter, we have been very, very successful to sign up a new power agreement. We have been successful to sign up power agreements in Brazil as well as in Australia, and that has been, because we have been able to develop extremely good government relations to those respective national leaders. They understand what we need to remain competitive. That's another classical parental advantage. But I could go through, I mean basically each single one of them. Measure us against whether we are able to perform with these businesses better than any other owner and I think we measure up well. So basically, we've told you one strategy we have, I don't want to get into it in detail, and we also have our Investor Day coming up in November so that we have plenty of time to review it and go into this in detail. We believe that this is the right strategy and the best way to deliver value."

Yes, we're committed to do almost whatever it takes, and we have shown that through our behavior on the last 4 years. So when the crisis started, you go back to 2009 and you start looking at our leverage and coverage ratios, obviously, from the amount of debt that we had at that point in time, at the end of '08, it was $10.6 billion, with $760 million of cash on hand, and the markets were in terrible condition and we certainly weren't generating a lot of EBITDA. It's considered a down part of the cycle. And I think what we've been able to do with the rating agencies is each of the years over the last 4 years is to lay out a plan to them at the beginning of the year on what we were going to do and what we're going to execute against in order to generate cash for the company. And in each of these 4 years independently, we've been able to achieve every one of those targets. So when you look at our coverage ratios, they fluctuate wildly obviously as a result of metal prices. But what we've been able to do is continue to take down our net debt position, and we were going to be $2 billion better on a net debt position than we were at the end of 2008. And as long as we continued to execute where we put ourselves in a positive free cash flow position, I think that will be what's looked at and not necessarily just the gross debt level. Hopefully that helps."

Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share. And if you exclude the impact of restructuring and special items, it gives us an income from continuing operations of $32 million or $0.03 per share.
Our revenue, EBITDA and ATOI all decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower LME prices. But it's important to note that even though the EBITDA fell to $282 million, adding back the noncash special items would place EBITDA at $496 million in the quarter.
So with that being said, taking a step back, how did we perform in the quarter? We had strong performance in all 4 of our segments. We take a look at the upstream segments, Alumina and Primary, excluding the impact of LME and currency, the combined segments of Alumina and Primary generated $98 million of performance sequentially; and both the Global Rolled Products segment and the Engineered Products and Solutions segment set records in the third quarter. Let me go through a few of those.
In GRP, we had record third quarter ATOI. We had record third quarter days working capital, we had record year-to-date ATOI and we had a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton. If you switch over to our Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had record third quarter ATOI, record quarterly EBITDA margin, record year-to-date ATOI and record year-to-date EBITDA margins.
Obviously, our segments performed extremely well. Taking a look at our core in a consolidated basis, we had a record low days working capital for the third quarter of 33 days, 5 days better than a year ago. Debt-to-capital remained at 36.1%, and our net-debt-to-capital stood at 32.4%. 
Our liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.4 billion, and I'll point out that, that excludes $224 million of restricted cash. We had a bond issuance during the quarter or tax-exempt bonds of 30 years issued, and that cash is for the Davenport expansion, and is going to stay restricted in order to pay for that expansion.
Okay. With that being said, let's take a look at the income statement. Just going to cover 3 items on the income statement. 
First, revenue. Revenue was down 2% sequentially, driven by lower realized metal prices and weakness in commercial transportation and industrial markets for our Global Rolled Products, and nonresidential building and construction in commercial transportation markets for Engineered Products and Solutions. 
COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially 390 basis points, driven primarily by the environmental and litigation reserves, as well as a lower LME. 
And lastly, on this sheet, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.9%. If you exclude discrete items, our operational year-to-date rate is 29%. We would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we'll continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility of our profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.  So our results for the quarter, as I said, was $0.13 loss excluding -- including special items.
So let's move on to those special items on the next slide. Special items for the quarter totaled $175 million or $0.16 a share. Let's start out with the environmental reserves. Environmental reserves were increased for 4 sites in the third quarter to reflect the revised cost estimates, of which Grasse River was the largest. On October 1, the EPA released the proposed remedial action plan, with a recommended capping and dredging solution of $243 million. This culminated a 20-year process, which included comprehensive scientific studies to evaluate and determine the recommended approach. It's estimated that the planning and design will take 2 to 3 years, and that will be followed by 4 years of remediation, beginning in 2016.
The next item on reserves was the litigation reserve at $40 million pretax and $15 million after tax. During the quarter, we reached a settlement of the Alba civil suit in the amount of $85 million. 1/2 was paid today, the other half will be paid one year from now. We recorded $40 million charge this quarter in addition to the $45 million charge we recorded in the second quarter. We believe the settlement represents the best possible outcome and avoids the time and expense of complex litigation.
Alcoa and Alba have also entered into an API-based, long-term alumina supply agreement. Resumption of commercial relationship demonstrates the desire to work together as well as the significant value that Alcoa brings to customers in the region, with superior quality and optimal logistics of its alumina.
The $26 million in discrete tax item relates to the interim treatment of losses in jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit. And then we had mark-to-market energy contracts and restructuring charges in the quarter as well. All told, it's $175 million or $0.16 a share of special items. And excluded, it brings our income from continuing operations to $0.03 a share.
Let's move on to the sequential bridge. Our income from continuing operations decreased from $61 million to $32 million or down $29 million sequentially. Obviously, the unfavorable market impact was driven by lower LME prices and unfavorable currency. The A dollar strengthened and was partially offset by weakening of the Brazilian real. 
The $21 million of net cost increases were more than overshadowed by the favorable price mix and productivity in the quarter of $86 million. The cost increases were largely a result of LIFO accrual, which reflected the rebound in metal prices.
We also continued strong productivity across Alumina, Primary Metals and EPS businesses this quarter, driven by higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates, usage reductions and reduced contractual spending. So if you looked at the $94 million of market impact and you were to take the net impact of all of the items and deem them to be performance of $65 million, you would see that we were able to eliminate 70% of the market impact to improve performance, strong performance from an operating basis.
Let's move on now and take a look at each one of the segments. Let's start with the Alumina segment. Production was up 1% as the Australian maintenance overhauls were completed in the second quarter. Shipments were up as a result of the increased production, as well as the tons that were shipped this quarter that were delayed at the end of last quarter.
So if you looked at the operating -- after-tax operating loss of $9 million, it's down $32 million sequentially, driven by price reductions, which impacted earnings by $91 million and $11 million in unfavorable currency.
Offsetting a major portion of the negative market impact of $102 million was $70 million of favorable performance, driven by price mix, productivity and volume. Productivity gains were $23 million. Price mix, a piece of that was driven by API improvement as the Alumina Price Index prices remained flat, while the LME declined.
So here again as you look at this segment, you see that 70% of the market impact was reduced by improved performance of $70 million. Looking to fourth quarter guidance in this segment, pricing on Alumina Price Index at 40% of third-party shipments, while other pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Caustic prices are expected to remain flat. API pricing has remained flat as the LME has recently increased since early September, and productivity gains are expected to continue. 
Let's move on to the Primary segment. Revenue is down slightly as higher third-party shipments were partially offset the impact of lower LME prices. LME prices were down 7% sequentially on a 15-day lagged basis, with realized prices down 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
The after-tax net operating loss of $14 million is -- from a $3 million in the second quarter for $11 million reduction. 
Starting first with the lower LME prices and currencies, combined the impacted ATOI $38 million negatively. Price mix was a favorable improvement and was driven mostly through regional premiums. In raw materials, we had higher alumina costs but these were partially offset by improving coke and pitch prices. And here, as in alumina, the performance of $27 million offset 70% of the market's deterioration of $38 million.
If you look to the fourth quarter guidance, pricing will continue to follow the 15-day lag, and anticipate the U.S. hydro asset sale to be completed by the end of the quarter.  We will continue productivity gains. Curtailments will unfavorably impact the fourth quarter ATOI by $15 million. So if you take back and take a step back and look at Alumina and Primary in total, we would expect, excluding LME, currency and the curtailment impact, that the upstream segments on a combined basis would remain flat on a sequential basis.
Let's move to the Global Rolled Products segment. Revenue was down $64 million or 3% sequentially, driven by weaker industrial and commercial transportation markets in Europe. ATOI was $98 million for the quarter, a $3 million sequential improvement and a 63% improvement over third quarter 2011. Price mix was a $19 million improvement, more than offset cost increases and lower volumes. 
I'd like to point out and remind you what we went through last time, and that was a part of the price mix is driven by customer pricing flowing through on a 15- to 30-day period, and inventory cost of metal comes through on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you'd expect compressed margins on falling metal price and increased margins on rising prices.
Cost increases consisted of metal premiums, labor and energy. I think it's important to take time out to look at the records of Global Rolled Products in this quarter. We had record third quarter ATOI of $98 million and adjusted EBITDA of $395 a ton. It's the highest-ever year-to-date ATOI of $289 million.
Year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton was a record at $405 per ton, 72% higher than the 10-year average. Also a record third quarter days working capital, down 5 days on a year-over-year basis. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect aerospace and automotive to continue to be strong. We will see a seasonal demand decrease in packaging. European and North American industrial markets had been weakening, and we have had a corresponding pricing and demand pressures as a result of that.
Excluding the impacts of LME and currency, ATOI is expected to be down 20% to 25% sequentially, due to the continuation of weaker industrial markets and the seasonal impact of packaging. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions segment. EPS continues its string of strong quarters. ATOI of $160 million is a record third quarter despite the decreased revenue. Third-party revenue was down 4% sequentially, due to seasonal declines in European building and construction and weakness in commercial transportation.
EPS continues its sequential productivity gains of $13 million in the third quarter, which more than offset higher costs in transportation, energy and maintenance. Here again, we had records in this segment: record quarterly EBITDA margin at 20.3%, record year-to-date ATOI of $475 million and record year-to-date EBITDA margin of 19.6%.
As we look to the fourth quarter, in the nonresidential building and construction business, we anticipate continued weakness, particularly in Europe. Heavy-duty truck build rates are expected to continue their decline in North America and Europe. As this is known for the EPS segment, we anticipate continued share gains and productivity improvements.
If you look back over the last few years, the fourth quarter is generally a slower quarter than the third by about 13% from a profitability standpoint. Due to productivity gains and shared gains offsetting weaknesses in commercial transportation and building and construction markets, we would expect a similar percentage decrease this year.
Let's move to the cash flow statement. Let's start with cash from operations. $263 million cash from operations in the quarter led to a negative free cash flow of $39 million. 
If you looked at the second quarter, cash from operations was $537 million, and there's really 3 main reasons for the decline from second quarter to third quarter. One is obviously the lower earnings. The second is interest payments, as we make semiannual interest payments in the first and third quarter. And the third is the tax refund that we garnered in the second quarter of $70 million, which is -- did not recur in the third quarter. Those 3 were partially offset by an improvement in working capital in the quarter.
Jumping to pension contributions, they totaled $163 million in the quarter for a total of $515 million year-to-date, and that represents more than 90% of the total 2012 estimated payments. We anticipate a fourth quarter contribution in the range of $50 million. And right now, we're looking at contributions for 2013 to be in the $450 million to $500 million range.
On a liquidity basis, as I said earlier, our debt-to-cap was at 36.1%, and our net debt-to-cap was 32.4%. Cash remains strong with $1.4 billion on hand, and we had 5-day improvement in days working capital. 
So let's switch now and look at the days working capital slide on the next page.  This is something that we're very proud of inside of the company because 33 days working capital is a record low for the third quarter. In fact, the reason we're proud of it is this is the 12th consecutive quarter we've demonstrated year-over-year improvement.
To give you a sense of what this is worth in terms of dollars, this 5-day improvement is worth about $315 million. And if you were to go back to the 2009 time frame when these initiatives geared up, the 15-day improvement, and that's worth about $1 billion. And we expect this trend to continue.
Let's move on to the next slide please. As we look at this quadrant of slides here, we like to point out that liquidity and how we've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet even in a volatile economic environment. First, let me reiterate that Alcoa is committed to our investment-grade status. That's why we've -- we're in the fourth year now of our Cash Sustainability Program that's allowed us to remain profitable and maintain a stable balance sheet in a very volatile economic environment, as I said.
We've got $1.4 billion of cash on hand. And I will point out again that, that doesn't include $224 million of restricted cash that we have, and we expect to be within our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 35% by year end. 
So let me take this and summarize it for you now. First of all, we're delivering on improvements to performance. We're executing the curtailments that we talked about in our upstream business as we're moving down the cost curve, and we're also generating significant productivity in the upstream in order to move down the cost curve. At the same time, we're setting both quarterly and annual records on margin and profitability in the mid and downstream businesses.
If you look to our annual targets -- first with productivity, give you a sense of where we stand. Our productivity target this year, which is a before-tax number of $800 million, through the first 9 months, we've got $838 million of before-tax productivity gains on a year-over-year basis.
We wanted to save another $50 million in overhead. Through the first 9 months, we're at $57 million. We wanted to be an additional 1.5 days down of working capital. And through the third quarter, we're 5 days better than the third quarter last year, and we anticipate that we will achieve this 1.5 days by year end balance. We had capital spend and investments of $1.7 billion, and we will be within that limit at year end.
Our debt-to-cap will fall within the 30% to 35% range. And most importantly, we anticipated that -- we had target that we're going to have free cash flow -- positive free cash flow this year. And based on where we stand right now, we still have that target that we're set to achieve for this year. 
So if you looked at it, we're achieving our 1- and 3- to 5-year targets by moving down the cost curve in upstream segment and generating top line growth and increasing margins in our mid and downstream segments. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Klaus."

So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets, and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, bas",4158,"Well thank you, Chuck. So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets, and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.
Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, basically, in most of our end markets. Global aerospace remains solid at 13% to 14% growth. We are pretty confident in that, and our confidence is supported by the continued strong performance in the large commercial aircraft segment. I've said it multiple times, but the backlog is now 8,500 planes, and that is basically in today's production, about an 8-year backlog. So this is solid.
Next one is automotive. I have a microphone problem. No? Okay, the next one is automotive. In the automotive markets, we are seeing an increase of 11% to 15% in North America. It's very interesting. When the September seasonally adjusted annual sales rate came out at 14.9 million cars, this marks the highest selling rate since March 2008, which is basically a plus 15% on a year-to-date basis. That's on top of a plus 15% we saw on a year-to-date basis compared to 2011, so that's a very positive development.
Automotive in Europe continues to decline, we believe, at minus 4% to minus 9%. China feels a bit more stable in the automotive segment. The sales are up on a year-over-year basis, 9%, and we expect a plus 4% to 7% growth this year. 
So next segment, heavy truck and trailer. We have lowered our expectation in each of the markets. So that globally, we expect a decline of minus 7% to minus 9%. This is substantially down from the minus 3% to the plus 1% that we expected in the second quarter here.
Let me go through it. On the North American side, we've seen the net orders in heavy trucks and trailers fall in the first quarter to the second quarter by 23%, and then again from the second to the third quarter by another 13%. Obviously, the truck OEMs have reduced their production in response to that, and we see a decline from the second to the third quarter of 18%. 
Interestingly, when you take a total look at the North American heavy truck picture, up to August and that's the only time that we have numbers, demand for freight was positive, up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis. So was the truck load rates, they were up 2.4%. That's interesting. At the same time, the truck fleet is pretty old at 6.6 years now. The 20-year average is at 5.8, so there is a replacement pressure.
But when we took a little bit of a deeper look, we saw that -- particularly the smaller and the medium-sized operators are concerned. I mean, the message is like fiscal cliff, euro news, China. All of that influence their sentiment. And I guess that, that makes them push their orders out kind of in anticipation of potentially a worry about the future.
On the European heavy truck and trailer side, the registration estimates for the third quarter are down 18% from the second quarter. The OEMs here, we believe, are reducing production. We expect a minus 8% to minus 11%.
China, heavy truck and trailer registration fell by 17% from the second -- from the first quarter to the second, and August and July even looked worse with a minus 31% below the second quarter. So we see production cuts here off the OEMs of around minus 24% from the second to the third quarter.
The next segment is beverage can packaging. We downward revised our growth expectations for Europe and China. But global growth basically stays at the same 2% to 3%, and that's possible given the relative size of these other markets compared to North America, and North America has actually pretty good and actually looked a little better than what we originally expected.
And last but not least, our outlook for commercial building and construction as well as industrial gas turbines remains unchanged. On the commercial building and construction, it's probably worthwhile to say a few words on the U.S. side. Architecture Billing Index is hovering around the midpoint, and the recent number on August turned positive. But before, they were 4 months down, and that was preceded by 5 months up. So you get a feel for it. It's a pretty fragile environment.
And on top of it, Architectural Billing Index is a nice early indicator. But always keep in mind, it takes 12 to 15 months until this really becomes billings and revenues in the market. So it's preceding a very, very early one.
So much on the building and construction side. On industrial gas turbines, probably one last sentence here. We continue to view the segment as very positive and strongly supported by the increased attractiveness of gas.
So that basically concludes our view on the end market side. Let's now take a look at what does that all mean for the aluminum demand. And we do see a slight slowdown in some regions and end markets and puts a little pressure on the demand growth. So we've lowered our demand projection for this year to 6%, down 1 percentage point from the 7% that we saw before.
Main driver for this is China. We saw in the first half of the year a demand growth of 11%. We believe this is going to come down in the second half, 7%. So you see here the average of this basically gets to 9%. And at the same time, we -- I am pretty confident, given the already announced China stimulus package, which is going into the ground, I mean, literarily speaking as we speak here. That the demand will be picking up speed, but this is probably going to take until the end of the fourth quarter. So by that time, we will probably be able to see that in the numbers.
Other than China, outside of China, basically Europe has weakened here. And relatively spoken the other bright spots of growth are U.S. as well as Middle East. 
So what does all of that mean now for the demand and supply picture? So let's bring on the next slide. Here on the left-hand side, you see the alumina; on the right-hand side, the aluminum. And you can already see by the numbers here, by the sheer size of the numbers or how small these numbers are, it doesn't really matter where exactly they are. I mean, we basically see the markets both are pretty much in balance.
On the left-hand side, the Alumina market, if you compare it with what we have before, moves into a slight surplus, and that's very much driven by China. We see lower production in China but we do see higher imports on the alumina side. Imports are up 192% year-over-year. And keep in mind, this is very strongly driven by the Indonesia bauxite ban. 60% of the bauxite in China gets imported, 80% of that used to come from Indonesia. Now it's not coming from there.
What we saw here, if you move to the right-hand side on the aluminum side, the Chinese aluminum market. We see some smelter expansion getting delayed, and at the same time also build up of the alumina reserve. And why do I say that as we are talking on the right-hand side with aluminum? Because what you see here, smelters are basically currently building a reserve on the alumina supply, given the uncertainty of the bauxite respective, the alumina supply situation. And the last thing that they want, they don't want to be caught by surprise and having to slow down or shut down their smelters.  So with all of that, with the slowdown of demand, China moves into a slight surplus here. 
The rest of the world remains in a deficit. Demand have declined a bit. But at the same time, we see some production losses, as well delays in new projects. So what does that all mean? The aluminum market also is moving or continues to be in a balance.
So let's also take a look at the regional premiums on the next slide. So what you see here is basically depiction of the regional premium over time, and they are up. And this is clearly an indication of the strength of the financial as well as the physical demand that drives tightness in the physical market. Regional premiums continued to rise. This is now the third consecutive quarter, and they have, as you see here, reached new record highs.
So let's move on to the inventory side. I know and I've heard that feedback from outside. This is a complex chart, so hang in with me. I'll run you through this. This actually not as complex as it looks. Let's first take a look at the mountain. The mountain that you see here is basically the stacking up of visible as well as inventory -- as well as invisible inventories. Obviously, that's an estimate, right, of the invisible inventory.
And when you look at the peak point of that mountain and look at where it is today, you actually see that the inventories have declined, in fact, 27 days from their peak in 2009. Compared to last quarter, it's pretty much flat at 75 days of consumption.
Let me also point out one other thing here, in the structure of the mountains, there's this strong yellowish top here on the right-hand side, which is called canceled warrants. And as you can nicely see, this has increased. So this is showing the desire of people wanting to get their metal off the exchange. In a way, it's a good indication for the appeal of financial deals and the type of optimism there in regards to the financial demand here in the mid as well as the long term staying attractive. 
The curve that we have in here, the blue curve that you have in here -- I haven't talked about that. That's the LME price, and as most of you guessed that. So now you have to put in perspective the mountain as -- together with where the LME is going. And classical supply and demand logic would indicate, as you see here in the earlier part of that slide, as the mountain builds, the price comes down. Mountain goes down, price goes up. That's exactly how the market is supposed to work. 
But basically in the mid-2011, you do see the market kind of comes down and the price rising [ph] very, very strongly. So what is happening here? Why is there this decoupling of the supply and demand side? And that's on the next slide.
What you see here is the bar is basically is the net, the supply and demand balance, so to say. And the curve here is an even more granular LME cash curve in that time frame. So obviously, as the blue bars move up, the metal price comes down. I mean, oversupply, price comes down, so clear. The blue bars go down, metal price goes up. 
And here again, you can see in the mid-2011, these fundamentals seem to get disconnected. And so demand-supply base fundamentals are basically decoupling from the LME pricing. So the real question is what is driving the LME then, if it's not the fundamentals? And you've seen some of that very nice in the next slide. 
So in times of crisis, obviously, that's not the first time that markets are seeing that. Macro factors can top the fundamentals. And obviously, that's the thing that's happening. Worries around the Eurozone crisis, U.S. debt, fiscal cliff, China slowdown worries. All of that goes in, and that's why we've seen metal price coming down from the $2,800 high in April last year to a low in summer of this year of $1,800, and that's only happened in a little more than a year time frame.
But it's also interesting to note that these things can very, very quickly reverse as we've recently seen. And we've recently seen this here. This is under the magnifying glass here. We've seen the LME shoot up to $2,200 per metric ton from $1,800 per metric ton. So basically just in 10 days, it shot up. But why did it shoot up? I mean, there were basically 4 announcements that made it shoot up. One was the ECB bond buying program. Preceding that was all the news around will it happen, will it happen, will it happen? That's why you see it coming up, but then moment comes, and it shoots up. 
Next thing, China stimulus plan; next thing, the German Constitutional Court ruling; and the next thing, the QE3 announcement. And wow, it's like a booster here, it shoots up. Nothing of that has changed anything of the fundamentals in our markets, right? So that's what you can clearly see here, the macro factors are currently dominating the pricing situation, but it can reverse very, very quickly as we have seen there.
So let me summarize the market side of things. So the market fundamentals are pretty much intact. We see the market is effectively in balance. On the supply demand side, premiums remain at a record high. Inventories are down. But currently, the market sentiment dominates the pricing. So that concludes the market side.
Let's now move into our businesses and review our businesses. And let's start with Alumina. And let's start on the upper left-hand side where you see the 10-year profitability. And you see it, it is a lower profitability at this point in time, and that's normal because it reflects the market conditions. But also, I think our actions have allowed us to at least return a profitability on a year-to-date basis. 
Why is that so? Part of it you see on the right upper-hand side because we have changed the pricing. We've changed it from an LME linkage to something that is really more in tune with the fundamentals of this market, which we call Alumina Pricing Index. And we've said that we are not going to sign any contracts based on that old scheme, and that's what we stick by. So by the end of this year, we believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot basis.
It's also clear, and we see that again reflected on the lower left-hand side, this is a commodity business. So it's all about where you are on the cost curve. We're not that badly positioned here, being on the 30th percentile. But we want to move down 7 percentage points by 2015 to the 23rd percentile. And we believe our actions are going to get us 1 to 3 percentage points down by the end of next year. 
So how are we going to do that? I mean, obviously a lot of that is already in the making. We have curtailed, and that's complete 390,000 tons basically in our Atlantic region refinery system. We continue to drive productivity, $320 million since 2010.
A major factor here is the thing that we call center of excellence in mining and refining. They have one task only. They detect the best practice and they roll it through the system in record speed, so that we can really capture the productivity that we generate at all places.
And in addition, cash management, well done, 8 days further down on days working capital, which means $150 million in cash. And then last but not least, Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget. And let me also remind you that this is lowest on the cost curve.
So let's move on to the next segment, the aluminum, our Primary Metals segment. The weakness here in pricing has divorced from the fundamentals of the aluminum industry, and that continues to challenge this segment. Our strategy, however, is, and that holds through, basically the whole upstream business, we focus on the things that we can control to maximize value.
So one of the things that we can control, for instance, is the value-add side here, which basically means optimizing our cast house profitability. What we've done here in a very systematic way, we're offering our customer value-add products, and we're capturing premiums to this, while we're limiting the logistics costs. And that alone has allowed us to add $375 million additional margin. That's very, very good.
While we do that, obviously, the biggest thing here given that, that's a commodity business, is pushing the cost down on the cost curve, 10 percentage points on the 51st percentile to the 41st percentile by 2015. That's our target, and we believe that we're going to get 3 to 6 percentage points out of the system by 2013.
A lot of actions are going on, and those that follow us more closely clearly see that. We have restructured our high costs. So we are in the process of restructuring our high-cost assets, permanently closed 290,000 tons in Tennessee and Rockdale; and partially curtailed Aviles and La Coruña in Spain, high-cost smelters in Spain. And we are moving forward with the curtailment of Italy. More than 70% of our Portovesme smelter is currently closed. This is one of the highest cost smelters in our whole system. Once all of this is complete, which will be soon, 14% of our global smelting system is curtailed.
Productivity gains in addition to that $385 million. We have also been able -- and this quarter shows it in a very nice way to improve our cost of power. This is a major factor here in the cost structure. In the U.S., in Australia and Brazil, in Australia and Brazil, with the great cooperation from the government to help us to remain competitive in this market. In addition to that, strong focus also on the cash side. 9 days out from days working capital equals $240 million in cash. And Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget.
The third segment here is our Global Rolled Products, and they continue to show strong performance. And they have achieved a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton, $405 per metric ton. Just look at that compared to where the 10-year average is of $235 per metric ton. They are really performing on a different performance level.
And in addition to that, they show solid growth in many segments like automotive, aerospace on a year-on-year basis. Also strong demand on North American packaging side, the utilization of 85% where we are today leaves room to grow. 
Talking about growth. We are preparing for additional growth in the automotive segment, and I'll talk about that at the very end a little bit. Our Davenport expansion is the biggest factor here. It's on time, on budget, and we will be able to roll the first car off in end of December of 2013. 
At the same time, we continue to move our existing business, productivity gains of $280 million, and we focus also here on the cash, 3 days of working capital out will give us additional $60 million compared to 2010. It's actually 5 days, if you compare it to last year.
Our fourth segment is the Engineered Products and Solutions business, and that achieved another record quarter. We now have an EBITDA margin that's above 20%, besides 20.3% in the third quarter. That's excellent performance.
If you look at the upper right-hand side, on the aerospace side, our utilization remained at 78%. And on the other businesses, due to the weakness on the commercial transportation as well as building and construction, it's down from 69% to 65% compared to the last, last, last quarter here.
The lower left-hand side there, that's a complicated one. But I'll tell you what it depicts. I mean, we are continuing to drive innovation. And when Airbus earlier this year came to us to introduce a very, very cool concept, the Sharklet, you see it depicted here. This is the thing that tips up the end of the wing and gives a massive, massive fuel efficiency improvement. We developed the extruded stringer with the new patented alloy. That alone allows 3.7% higher strength-to-weight ratio, which results in a fuel-burn reduction of 3.5%. That's great. 
And that's not the only thing that happened on the innovation front. An equally great one is the other one that's depicted here. This is a very, very interesting new turbine, new jet engine by Pratt & Whitney called The Geared Turbofan. And we have been able to place our ultra-efficient lightweight, low-speed blade made of aluminum-lithium in there. And obviously, these type of innovations driven by very, very strong also innovation on the fundamental metal side are driving share gain and growth. And that is part of the strength of our downstream business, and we will continue to do it and leverage our core advantages in that. 
At the same time, they are not letting go on the productivity side. You see the productivity gains here of $350 million since 2010, very, very well done.
So that concludes the business side. But before I conclude the presentation entirely, let me also do one deep dive here on the automotive front because that is a fascinating thing that changes there. Many of you might have heard here in the U.S. now finally, we also are focusing in the U.S. here on fuel efficiency. Regulation has come out here called new CAFE regulation, Corporate Average Fuel Economy. You see that depicted here on the left-hand side. The firms are forced to get up 31% and double their fuel efficiency of their fleet. That's what the automotive companies are legislated to.
At the same time, and that's the middle part here, consumer behavior is shifting. And in 2008, if you looked at the consumer surveys, 54% of the potential buyers of cars would have said, ""I'm willing to pay more for fuel efficiency."" This number is now up to 83%. So basically pretty much everybody says, I mean, ""I'm willing to pay more for more fuel efficiency."" This is obviously also driven by the rising fuel prices that has accelerated, I mean, really during that time frame. 
And actually it's even more interesting when you look at how many people are ranking this even as their #1 factor for buying, and it's 37% that rated as the #1 buying decision, and that's across the business segments. So the car companies have followed up on that, and that's why you see that they're offering fuel efficient choices pretty much in all segments.
So both of these changes, I mean, the legislation change as well as the consumer demand change, both of those drive light-weighting and drive to get more aluminum into cars, drive for substitution with other materials. 
There's been a study out recently that basically it shows that this light-weighting, as an answer to these questions, is a very, very cost-effective solution for the automotive company. That's why we are seeing what we are seeing. 
In addition to that, this allows changes to be done without any compromise on the safety side. Recently again, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration reconfirmed that light-weighting is a choice that allows for the same safety. That's a great thing here. That's a real winner. And that's why you see here on the right-hand side, we believe demand is going to increase 4x by 2016 and going to increase 7.5x by 2020. That's why the expansion in Davenport, which I talked about before, is so important, and that's also why our Middle Eastern project will have an automotive capacity in it.
So let's go to the last slide here. So let me summarize. The industry fundamentals are solid, but the macro sentiment basically dominates. We are delivering strong results. We are controlling our own destiny and we're not standing still. Upstream, $98 million in performance improvement. We're restructuring our high-cost assets on the midstream, the Global Rolled Products side, record performance, record profitability per metric ton. On the Engineered Products and Solutions business, our downstream business, highest EBITDA margin ever with 20.3%. In addition to that, good cash management, record low third quarter days working capital. 
And on the right-hand side, I just gave you one deep dive here in the automotive market. We continue to aluminize different industries, and that's a good thing.
And let me close here. We don't want to stop our aluminization strategy, so to say, here on earth. We are very proud that we have been part of NASA's curiosity rover that just landed on Mars. This really connects well to the vision of our founders and enabling mankind's biggest dreams. That's also very much in line with our vision advancing each generation.
So that said, let me open the line for questions."

And I know that we have talked with those that follow us a lot, we've talked about it quite a bit. But I'm happy to give you a high-level overview. First thing is I mean, we don't see any kind of rocks that should remain unturned or that should not be questioned. Everybody knows that the business that we have does not, by definition, belong into our portfolio. We actually put it on a test and say we have to prove for every business that we have that we are a better parent to that business than anybody else. And that basically brings out the question of what can Alcoa add in the business as an Alcoa advantage. And the answer to that, I mean, are multi-fold. I mean, in principle, you see it coming in through technology. You see it in through procurement. It comes in through customer intimacy, customer reach, through the talent management that we have, through the operating system. That's how we can generate value. And basically, you see it very, very nicely in the performances that we have been able to generate in the downstream as well as the midstream business and how we are performing against bringing the upstream business down on the cost curve. So that's basically where we are on that. And I can go into all kinds of examples here. I mean, I could just take out the examples that I used here in my presentation today. I mean, on the EPS business, for instance, the 2 examples on Airbus as well as on Pratt & Whitney. In both cases, these innovations were new alloys. The alloys were not developed in the downstream business. The alloys were developed there where we have the best alloying experts, which is basically in our tech center. This is how we leverage technology as an example. Now you go to the upstream side, and take an example out of this quarter. I mean, this quarter, we have been very, very successful to sign up a new power agreement. We have been successful to sign up power agreements in Brazil as well as in Australia. And that has been because we have been able to develop extremely good government relations to those respective national leaders. They understand what we need to remain competitive. That's another classical parental advantage. But I could go through, I mean, basically each single one of them. Measure us against whether we are able to perform with these businesses better than any other owner, and I think we measure up well. So basically, we've told you what strategy we have. I don't want to get into it in detail, and we also have our Investor Day coming up in November. So that we have plenty of time to review it and go into this in detail. We believe that this is the right strategy and the best way to deliver value. Thank you, David."

Yes, we're committed to do almost whatever it takes, and we have shown that through our behavior on the last 4 years. So when the crisis started, if you go back to 2009 and you start looking at our leverage and coverage ratios, obviously, from the amount of debt that we had at that point in time -- at the end of '08, it was $10.6 billion, with $760 million of cash on hand, and the markets were in terrible condition, and we certainly weren't generating a lot of EBITDA. It's considered a down part of the cycle. And I think what we've been able to do with the rating agencies is each of the years, over the last 4 years is to lay out a plan to them at the beginning of the year on what we were going to do and what we're going to execute against in order to generate cash for the company. And in each of these 4 years, independently we've been able to achieve every one of those targets. So when you look at our coverage ratios, they fluctuate wildly obviously as a result of metal prices. But what we've been able to do is continue to take down our net-debt position, and we are going to be $2 billion better on a net-debt position than we were at the end of 2008. And as long as we continue to execute where we put ourselves in a positive free cash flow position, I think that will be what's looked at and not necessarily just the gross debt level. Hopefully that helps."

249603,145606306,364019,"Alcoa, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 09, 2012",2012-10-09,"Earnings Calls","Alcoa Inc.","Executives","Okay, thanks, Kelly.  Thanks, everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Let's start off with the financial overview for the quarter. Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share. And if you exclude the impact of",2742,"Okay, thanks, Kelly.  Thanks, everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Let's start off with the financial overview for the quarter. Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share. And if you exclude the impact of restructuring and special items, it gives us an income from continuing operations of $32 million or $0.03 per share.
Our revenue, EBITDA and ATOI all decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower LME prices. But it's important to note that even though the EBITDA fell to $282 million, adding back the noncash special items would place EBITDA at $496 million in the quarter.
So with that being said, taking a step back, how did we perform in the quarter? We had strong performance in all 4 of our segments. We take a look at the upstream segments, Alumina and Primary, excluding the impact of LME and currency, the combined segments of Alumina and Primary generated $98 million of performance sequentially; and both the Global Rolled Products segment and the Engineered Products and Solutions segment set records in the third quarter. Let me go through a few of those.
In GRP, we had a record third quarter ATOI. We had a record third quarter days working capital, we had record year-to-date ATOI and we had a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton. If you switch over to our Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had record third quarter ATOI, record quarterly EBITDA margin, record year-to-date ATOI and record year-to-date EBITDA margins.
Obviously, our segments performed extremely well. Taking a look at our core in a consolidated basis, we had a record low days working capital for the third quarter of 33 days, 5 days better than a year ago. Debt-to-capital remained at 36.1%, and our net-debt-to-capital stood at 32.4%. 
Our liquidity remains strong, with cash on hand of $1.4 billion, and I'll point out that, that excludes $224 million of restricted cash. We had a bond issuance during the quarter, tax-exempt bonds of 30 years issued, and that cash is for the Davenport expansion and is going to stay restricted in order to pay for that expansion.
Okay. With that being said, let's take a look at the income statement. Just going to cover 3 items on the income statement. 
First, revenue. Revenue was down 2% sequentially, driven by lower realized metal prices and weakness in commercial transportation and industrial markets for our Global Rolled Products and nonresidential building and construction in commercial transportation markets for Engineered Products and Solutions. 
COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially 390 basis points, driven primarily by the environmental and litigation reserves as well as a lower LME. 
And lastly, on this sheet, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.9%. If you exclude discrete items, our operational year-to-date rate is 29%. We would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we'll continue to experience swings in the rate, given the volatility of our profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.  So our results for the quarter, as I said, was $0.13 loss excluding -- including special items.
So let's move on to those special items on the next slide. Special items for the quarter totaled $175 million or $0.16 a share. Let's start out with the environmental reserves. Environmental reserves were increased for 4 sites in the third quarter to reflect the revised cost estimates, of which Grasse River was the largest. On October 1, the EPA released the proposed remedial action plan, with a recommended capping and dredging solution of $243 million. This culminated a 20-year process, which included comprehensive scientific studies to evaluate and determine the recommended approach. It's estimated that the planning and design will take 2 to 3 years, and that will be followed by 4 years of remediation, beginning in 2016.
The next item on reserves was the litigation reserve at $40 million pretax and $15 million after tax. During the quarter, we reached a settlement of the Alba civil suit in the amount of $85 million. 1/2 was paid today, the other half will be paid one year from now. We recorded $40 million charge this quarter in addition to the $45 million charge we recorded in the second quarter. We believe the settlement represents the best possible outcome and avoids the time and expense of complex litigation.
Alcoa and Alba have also entered into an API-based, long-term alumina supply agreement. Resumption of commercial relationship demonstrates the desire to work together as well as the significant value that Alcoa brings to customers in the region, with superior quality and optimal logistics of its alumina.
The $26 million in discrete tax item relates to the interim treatment of losses in jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit. And then we had mark-to-market energy contracts and restructuring charges in the quarter as well. All told, it's $175 million or $0.16 a share of special items. And excluded, it brings our income from continuing operations to $0.03 a share.
Let's move on to the sequential bridge. Our income from continuing operations decreased from $61 million to $32 million or down $29 million sequentially. Obviously, the unfavorable market impact was driven by lower LME prices and unfavorable currency. The A dollar strengthened and was partially offset by weakening of the Brazilian real. 
The $21 million of net cost increases were more than overshadowed by the favorable price mix and productivity in the quarter of $86 million. The cost increases were largely a result of LIFO accrual, which reflected the rebound in metal prices.
We also continued strong productivity across Alumina, Primary Metals and EPS businesses this quarter, driven by higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates, usage reductions and reduced contractual spending. So if you looked at the $94 million of market impact and you were to take the net impact of all of the items and deem them to be performance of $65 million, you would see that we were able to eliminate 70% of the market impact through improved performance, strong performance from an operating basis.
Let's move on now and take a look at each one of the segments. Let's start with the Alumina segment. Production was up 1% as the Australian maintenance overhauls were completed in the second quarter. Shipments were up as a result of the increased production, as well as the tons that were shipped this quarter that were delayed at the end of last quarter.
So if you looked at the operating -- after-tax operating loss of $9 million, it's down $32 million sequentially, driven by price reductions, which impacted earnings by $91 million, and $11 million in unfavorable currency.
Offsetting a major portion of the negative market impact of $102 million was $70 million of favorable performance, driven by price mix, productivity and volume. Productivity gains were $23 million. Price mix, a piece of that, was driven by API improvement as the alumina price Index prices remained flat while the LME declined.
So here again as you look at this segment, you see that 70% of the market impact was reduced by improved performance of $70 million. Looking to fourth quarter guidance in this segment, pricing on alumina price index at 40% of third-party shipments, while other pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Caustic prices are expected to remain flat. API pricing has remained flat as the LME has recently increased since early September, and productivity gains are expected to continue. 
Let's move on to the Primary segment. Revenue is down slightly as higher third-party shipments partially offset the impact of lower LME prices. LME prices were down 7% sequentially on a 15-day-lag basis, with realized prices down 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
The after-tax net operating loss of $14 million is -- from a $3 million in the second quarter for $11 million reduction. 
Starting first with the lower LME prices and currencies.  Combined, they impacted ATOI $38 million negatively. Price mix was a favorable improvement and was driven mostly through regional premiums. In raw materials, we had higher alumina costs, but these were partially offset by improving coke and pitch prices. And here, as in alumina, the performance of $27 million offset 70% of the market's deterioration of $38 million.
If you look to the fourth quarter guidance, pricing will continue to follow the 15-day lag.  We anticipate the U.S. hydro asset sale to be completed by the end of the quarter.  We will continue productivity gains. Curtailments will unfavorably impact the fourth quarter ATOI by $15 million. So if you take back and take a step back and look at Alumina and Primary in total, we would expect, excluding LME, currency and the curtailment impact, that the upstream segments on a combined basis would remain flat on a sequential basis.
Let's move to the Global Rolled Products segment. Revenue was down $64 million or 3% sequentially, driven by weaker industrial and commercial transportation markets in Europe. ATOI was $98 million for the quarter, a $3 million sequential improvement and a 63% improvement over third quarter 2011. Price mix was a $19 million improvement, more than offset cost increases and lower volumes. 
I'd like to point out and remind you what we went through last time, and that was a part of the price mix is driven by customer pricing flowing through on a 15- to 30-day period, and inventory cost of metal comes through on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you'd expect compressed margins on falling metal price and increased margins on rising prices.
Cost increases consisted of metal premiums, labor and energy. I think it's important to take time out to look at the records of Global Rolled Products in this quarter. We had record third quarter ATOI of $98 million and adjusted EBITDA of $395 a ton. It's the highest-ever year-to-date ATOI of $289 million.
Year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton was a record at $405 per ton, 72% higher than the 10-year average. Also a record third quarter days working capital, down 5 days on a year-over-year basis. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect aerospace and automotive to continue to be strong. We will see a seasonal demand decrease in packaging. European and North American industrial markets had been weakening, and we have had a corresponding pricing and demand pressures as a result of that.
Excluding the impacts of LME and currency, ATOI is expected to be down 20% to 25% sequentially due to the continuation of weaker industrial markets and the seasonal impact of packaging. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions segment. EPS continues its string of strong quarters. ATOI of $160 million is a record third quarter, despite the decreased revenue. Third-party revenue was down 4% sequentially, due to seasonal declines in European building and construction and weakness in commercial transportation.
EPS continues its sequential productivity gains of $13 million in the third quarter, which more than offset higher costs in transportation, energy and maintenance. Here again, we had records in this segment: record quarterly EBITDA margin at 20.3%, record year-to-date ATOI of $475 million and record year-to-date EBITDA margin of 19.6%.
As we look to the fourth quarter, in the nonresidential building and construction business, we anticipate continued weakness, particularly in Europe. Heavy-duty truck build rates are expected to continue their decline in North America and Europe. As this is normal for the EPS segment, we anticipate continued share gains and productivity improvements.
If you look back over the last few years, the fourth quarter is generally a slower quarter than the third by about 13% from a profitability standpoint. Due to productivity gains and share gains offsetting weaknesses in commercial transportation and building and construction markets, we would expect a similar percentage decrease this year.
Let's move to the cash flow statement. Let's start with cash from operations. $263 million cash from operations in the quarter led to a negative free cash flow of $39 million. 
If you looked at the second quarter, cash from operations was $537 million, and there's really 3 main reasons for the decline from second quarter to third quarter. One is obviously the lower earnings. The second is interest payments, as we make semiannual interest payments in the first and third quarter. And the third is the tax refund that we garnered in the second quarter of $70 million, which is -- did not recur in the third quarter. Those 3 were partially offset by an improvement in working capital in the quarter.
Jumping to pension contributions, they totaled $163 million in the quarter for a total of $515 million year-to-date, and that represents more than 90% of the total 2012 estimated payments. We anticipate a fourth quarter contribution in the range of $50 million. And right now, we're looking at contributions for 2013 to be in the $450 million to $500 million range.
On a liquidity basis, as I said earlier, our debt-to-cap was at 36.1%, and our net debt-to-cap was 32.4%. Cash remains strong with $1.4 billion on hand, and we had 5-day improvement in days working capital. 
So let's switch now and look at the days working capital slide on the next page.  This is something that we're very proud of inside of the company, because 33 days working capital is a record low for the third quarter. In fact, the reason we're proud of it is this is the 12th consecutive quarter we've demonstrated year-over-year improvement.
To give you a sense of what this is worth in terms of dollars, this 5-day improvement is worth about $315 million. And if you were to go back to the 2009 time frame when these initiatives geared up, it's a 15-day improvement, and that's worth about $1 billion. And we expect this trend to continue.
Let's move on to the next slide, please. As we look at this quadrant of slides here, we like to point out our liquidity and how we've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet, even in a volatile economic environment. First, let me reiterate that Alcoa is committed to our investment-grade status. That's why we've -- we're in the fourth year now of a Cash Sustainability Program that's allowed us to remain profitable and maintain a stable balance sheet in a very volatile economic environment, as I said.
We've got $1.4 billion of cash on hand. And I will point out again that, that doesn't include $224 million of restricted cash that we have, and we expect to be within our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 35% by year end. 
So let me take this and summarize it for you now. First of all, we're delivering on improvements to performance. We're executing the curtailments that we talked about in our upstream business as we're moving down the cost curve, and we're also generating significant productivity in the upstream in order to move down the cost curve. At the same time, we're setting both quarterly and annual records on margin and profitability in the mid- and downstream businesses.
If you look to our annual targets -- first with productivity, give you a sense of where we stand. Our productivity target this year, which is a before-tax number of $800 million, through the first 9 months, we've got $838 million of before-tax productivity gains on a year-over-year basis.
We wanted to save another $50 million in overhead. Through the first 9 months, we're at $57 million. We wanted to be an additional 1.5 days down on working capital. And through the third quarter, we're 5 days better than the third quarter last year, and we anticipate that we will achieve this 1.5 days by year end balance. We had capital spend and investments of $1.7 billion, and we will be within that limit at year end.
Our debt-to-cap will fall within the 30% to 35% range. And most importantly, we anticipated that we had target that we're going to have free cash flow -- positive free cash flow this year. And based on where we stand right now, we still have that target that we're set to achieve for this year. 
So if you looked at it, we're achieving our 1- and 3- to 5-year targets by moving down the cost curve in upstream segment and generating top line growth and increasing margins in our mid- and downstream segments. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Klaus."
249603,145606306,364019,"Alcoa, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 09, 2012",2012-10-09,"Earnings Calls","Alcoa Inc.","Executives","Well thank you, Chuck. So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, basi",4153,"Well thank you, Chuck. So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.
Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, basically, in most of our end markets. Global aerospace remains solid at a 13% to 14% growth. We are pretty confident in that, and our confidence is supported by the continued strong performance in the large commercial aircraft segment. I've said it multiple times, but the backlog is now 8,500 planes, and that is basically in today's production about an 8-year backlog. So this is solid.
Next one is automotive. We have a microphone problem?  No? Okay, the next one is automotive. In the automotive markets, we are seeing an increase of 11% to 15% in North America. It's very interesting. When the September seasonally adjusted annual sales rate came out at 14.9 million cars, this marks the highest selling rate since March 2008, which is basically a plus 15% on a year-to-date basis. That's on top of a plus 15% we saw on a year-to-date basis compared to 2011, so that's a very positive development.
Automotive in Europe continues to decline, we believe, at minus 4% to minus 9%. China feels a bit more stable in the automotive segment. The sales are up on a year-on-year basis 9%, and we expect a plus 4% to 7% growth this year. 
So next segment, heavy truck and trailer. We have lowered our expectation in each of the markets so that globally, we expect a decline of minus 7% to minus 9%. This is substantially down from the minus 3% to the plus 1% that we expected in the second quarter here.
Let me go through it. On the North American side, we've seen the net orders in heavy trucks and trailers fall in the first quarter to the second quarter by 23% and then again from the second to the third quarter by another 13%. Obviously, the truck OEMs have reduced their production in response to that, and we see a decline from the second to the third quarter of 18%. 
Interestingly, when you take a total look at the North American heavy truck picture, up to August, and that's the only time that we have numbers, demand for freight was positive, up 3.8%, on a year-over-year basis. So were the truck load rates, they were up 2.4%. That's interesting. And at the same time, the truck fleet is pretty old at 6.6 years now. The 20-year average is at 5.8, so there is a replacement pressure.
But when we took a little bit of a deeper look, we saw that -- particularly the small and the medium-sized operators are concerned. I mean, the message is like fiscal cliff, euro news, China. All of that influence their sentiment. And I guess that, that makes them push their orders out kind of in anticipation of potentially a worry about the future.
On the European heavy truck and trailer side, the registration estimates for the third quarter are down 18% from the second quarter. The OEMs here, we believe, are reducing production. We expect a minus 8% to minus 11%.
China, heavy truck and trailer registration fell by 17% from the second -- from the first quarter to the second, and August and July even looked worse with a minus 31% below the second quarter. So we see production cuts here off the OEMs of around minus 24% from the second to the third quarter.
The next segment is beverage can packaging. We downward-revised our growth expectations for Europe and China. But global growth basically stays at the same 2% to 3%, and that's possible given the relative size of these other markets compared to North America, and North America is actually pretty good and actually looked a little better than what we originally expected.
And last but not least, our outlook for commercial building and construction as well as industrial gas turbines remains unchanged. On the commercial building and construction, it's probably worthwhile to say a few words on the U.S. side. Architecture Billing Index is hovering around the midpoint, and the recent number on August turned positive. But before, they were 4 months down, and that was preceded by 5 months up. So you get a feel for it. It's a pretty fragile environment.
And on top of it, Architectural Billing Index is a nice early indicator. But always keep in mind, it takes 12 to 15 months until this really becomes billings and revenues in the market. So it's preceding a very, very early one.
So much on the building and construction side. On industrial gas turbines, probably one last sentence here. We continue to view the segment as very positive and strongly supported by the increased attractiveness of gas.
So that basically concludes our view on the end market side. Let's now take a look at what does that all mean for the aluminum demand?  And we do see a slight slowdown in some regions and end markets and puts a little pressure on the demand growth. So we've lowered our demand projection for this year to 6%, down 1 percentage point from the 7% that we saw before.
Main driver for this is China. We saw in the first half of the year a demand growth of 11%. We believe this is going to come down in the second half to 7%. So you see here the average of this basically gets to 9%. And at the same time, we -- I am pretty confident, given the already-announced China stimulus package, which is going into the ground, I mean, literally speaking, as we speak here, that the demand will be picking up speed.  But this is probably going to take until the end of the fourth quarter. So by that time, we will probably be able to see that in the numbers.
Other than China, outside of China, basically Europe has weakened here. And relatively spoken, the other bright spots of growth are U.S. as well as Middle East. 
So what does all of that mean now for the demand and supply picture? So let's bring on the next slide. Here on the left-hand side, you see the alumina; on the right-hand side, the aluminum. And you can already see by the numbers here, by the sheer size of the numbers or how small these numbers are, it doesn't really matter where exactly they are. I mean, we basically see the markets both are pretty much in balance.
On the left-hand side, the alumina market, if you compare it with what we have before, moves into a slight surplus, and that's very much driven by China. We see lower production in China, but we do see higher imports on the alumina side. Imports are up 192% year-over-year. And keep in mind, this is very strongly driven by the Indonesia bauxite ban. 60% of the bauxite in China gets imported, 80% of that used to come from Indonesia. Now it's not coming from there.
What we saw here, if you move to the right-hand side on the aluminum side, the Chinese aluminum market. We see some smelter expansion getting delayed and at the same time also buildup of the alumina reserve. And why do I say that as we are talking on the right-hand side with aluminum? Because what you see here, smelters are basically currently building a reserve on the alumina supply, given the uncertainty of the bauxite respective, the alumina supply situation. And the last thing that they want, they don't want to be caught by surprise and having to slow down or shut down their smelters.  So with all that, with the slowdown of demand, China moves into a slight surplus here. 
The rest of the world remains in a deficit. Demand has declined a bit. But at the same time, we see some production losses as well delays in new projects. So what does that all mean? The aluminum market also is moving or continues to be in a balance.
So let's also take a look at the regional premiums on the next slide. So what you see here is basically depiction of the regional premium over time, and they are up. And this is clearly an indication of the strength of the financial as well as the physical demand that drives tightness in the physical market. Regional premiums continued to rise. This is now the third consecutive quarter, and they have, as you see here, reached new record highs.
So let's move on to the inventory side. I know and I've heard that feedback from outside. This is a complex chart, so hang in with me. I'll run you through this. This actually not as complex as it looks. Let's first take a look at the mountain. The mountain that you see here is basically the stacking up of visible as well as inventory -- as well as invisible inventories. Obviously, that's an estimate, right, of the invisible inventory.
And when you look at the peak point of that mountain and look at where it is today, you actually see that the inventories have declined, in fact, 27 days from their peak in 2009. Compared to last quarter, it's pretty much flat at 75 days of consumption.
Let me also point out one other thing here, in the structure of the mountains, there's this strong yellowish top here on the right-hand side, which is called canceled warrants. And as you can nicely see, this has increased. So this is showing the desire of people wanting to get their metal off the exchange. In a way, it's a good indication for the appeal of financial deals and the type of optimism there in regards to the financial demand here in the mid- as well as the long term staying attractive. 
The curve that we have in here, the blue curve that you have in here -- I haven't talked about that. That's the LME price, and I guess most of you guessed that. So now you have to put in perspective the mountain as -- together with where the LME is going. And classical supply and demand logic would indicate, as you see here in the earlier part of that slide, as the mountain builds, the price comes down. Mountain goes down, price goes up. That's exactly how the market is supposed to work. 
But basically in the mid-2011, you do see the market kind of comes down and the price re-syncs very, very strongly. So what is happening here? Why is there this decoupling of the supply and demand side? And that's on the next slide.
What you see here is the bar is basically is the net, the supply and demand balance, so to say. And the curve here is an even more granular LME cash curve in that time frame. So obviously, as the blue bars move up, the metal price comes down. I mean, oversupply, price comes down, so clear. The blue bars go down, metal price goes up. 
And here again, you can see in the mid-2011, these fundamentals seem to get disconnected. And so demand-supply base fundamentals are basically decoupling from the LME pricing. So the real question is what is driving the LME then, if it's not the fundamentals? And you've seen some of that very nice in the next slide. 
So in times of crisis, obviously, that's not the first time that markets are seeing that macro factors can top the fundamentals. And obviously, that's the thing that's happening. Worries around the Eurozone crisis, U.S. debt, fiscal cliff, China slowdown worries. All of that goes in, and that's why we've seen metal price coming down from the $2,800 high in April last year to a low in summer of this year of $1,800, and that's only happened in a little more than a year time frame.
But it's also interesting to note that these things can very, very quickly reverse, as we've recently seen. And we've recently seen this here. This is under the magnifying glass here. We've seen the LME shoot up to $2,200 per metric ton from $1,800 per metric ton. So basically just in 10 days, it shot up. But why did it shoot up? I mean, there were basically 4 announcements that made it shoot up. One was the ECB bond buying program. Preceding that was all the news around will it happen, will it happen, will it happen? That's why you see it coming up, but then, boom, it comes, and it shoots up. 
Next thing, China stimulus plan; next thing, the German Constitutional Court ruling; and the next thing, the QE3 announcement. And wow, it's like a booster here, it shoots up. Nothing of that has changed anything of the fundamentals in our markets, right? So that's what you can clearly see here.  The macro factors are currently dominating the pricing situation, but it can reverse very, very quickly, as we have seen there.
So let me summarize the market side of things. So the market fundamentals are pretty much intact. We see the market is effectively in balance. On the supply-demand side, premiums remain at a record high. Inventories are down. But currently, the market sentiment dominates the pricing. So that concludes the market side.
Let's now move into our businesses and review our businesses. And let's start with Alumina. And let's start on the upper left-hand side, where you see the 10-year profitability. And you see it, it is a lower profitability at this point in time, and that's normal because it reflects the market conditions. But also, I think our actions have allowed us to at least return to profitability on a year-to-date basis. 
Why is that so? Part of it you see on the right upper-hand side, because we have changed the pricing. We've changed it from an LME linkage to something that is really more in tune with the fundamentals of this market, which we call alumina pricing index. And we've said that we are not going to sign any contracts based on that old scheme, and that's what we stick by. So by the end of this year, we believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot basis.
It's also clear, and we see that again reflected on the lower left-hand side, this is a commodity business. So it's all about where you are on the cost curve. We're not that badly positioned here, being on the 30th percentile. But we want to move down 7 percentage points by 2015 to the 23rd percentile. And we believe our actions are going to get us 1 to 3 percentage points down by the end of next year. 
So how are we going to do that? I mean, obviously a lot of that is already in the making. We have curtailed, and that's complete, 390,000 tons basically in our Atlantic region refinery system. We continue to drive productivity, $320 million since 2010.
A major factor here is the thing that we call Center of Excellence in mining and refining. They have one task only. They detect the best practice and they roll it through the system in record speed so that we can really capture the productivity that we generate at all places.
And in addition, cash management, well done, 8 days further down on days working capital, which means $150 million in cash. And then last but not least, Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget. And let me also remind you that this is lowest on the cost curve.
So let's move on to the next segment, the aluminum, our Primary Metals segment. The weakness here in pricing has divorced from the fundamentals of the aluminum industry, and that continues to challenge this segment. Our strategy, however, is, and that holds through, basically the whole upstream business, we focus on the things that we can control to maximize value.
So one of the things that we can control, for instance, is the value-add side here, which basically means optimizing our cast house profitability [ph]. What we've done here in a very systematic way, we're offering our customer value-add product, and we're capturing premiums though this while we're limiting the logistics costs. And that alone has allowed us to add $375 million additional margin. That's very, very good.
While we do that, obviously, the biggest thing here, given that that's a commodity business, is pushing the cost down on the cost curve, 10 percentage points on the 51st percentile to the 41st percentile by 2015. That's our target, and we believe that we're going to get 3 to 6 percentage points out of the system by 2013.
A lot of actions are going on, and those that follow us more closely clearly see that. We have restructured our high-cost -- or we are in the process of restructuring our high-cost assets; permanently closed 290,000 tons in Tennessee and Rockdale; partially curtailed Aviles and La Coruña in Spain, high-cost smelters in Spain; and we are moving forward with the curtailment of Italy. More than 70% of our Portovesme smelter is currently closed. This is one of the highest-cost smelters in our whole system. Once all of this is complete, which will be soon, 14% of our global smelting system is curtailed.
Productivity gains in addition to that $385 million. We have also been able, and this quarter shows it in a very nice way, to improve our cost of power. This is a major factor here in the cost structure. In the U.S., in Australia and Brazil, in Australia and Brazil, with the great cooperation from the government to help us to remain competitive in this market. In addition to that, strong focus also on the cash side. 9 days out from days working capital equals $240 million in cash. And Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget.
The third segment here is our Global Rolled Products, and they continue to show strong performance. And they have achieved a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton, $405 per metric ton. Just look at that compared to where the 10-year average is of $235 per metric ton. They are really performing on a different performance level.
And in addition to that, they show solid growth in many segments like automotive, aerospace on a year-on-year basis. Also strong demand on North American packaging side, the utilization of 85% where we are today leaves room to grow. 
Talking about growth. We are preparing for additional growth in the automotive segment, and I'll talk about that at the very end a little bit. Our Davenport expansion is the biggest factor here. It's on time, on budget, and we will be able to roll the first car off in end of December of 2013. 
At the same time, we continue to move our existing business, productivity gains of $280 million, and we focus also here on the cash, 3 days of working capital out will give us additional $60 million compared to 2010. It's actually 5 days, if you compare it to last year.
Our fourth segment is the Engineered Products and Solutions business, and that achieved another record quarter. We now have an EBITDA margin that's above 20%, beside 20.3% in the third quarter. That's excellent performance.
If you look at the upper-right-hand side, on the aerospace side, our utilization remained at 78%. And on the other businesses, due to the weakness on the commercial transportation as well as building and construction, it's down from 69% to 65% compared to the last, last, last quarter here.
The lower left-hand side there, that's a complicated one. But I'll tell you what it depicts. I mean, we are continuing to drive innovation. And when Airbus earlier this year came to us to introduce a very, very cool concept, the Sharklet, you see it depicted here. This is the thing that tips up the end of the wing and gives a massive, massive fuel efficiency improvement. We developed the extruded stringer with the new patented alloy. That alone allows 3.7% higher strength-to-weight ratio, which results in a fuel-burn reduction of 3.5%. That's great. 
And that's not the only thing that happened on the innovation front. An equally great one is the other one that's depicted here. This is a very, very interesting new turbine, new jet engine by Pratt & Whitney called The Geared Turbofan. And we have been able to place our ultra-efficient lightweight, low-speed blade made of aluminum-lithium in there. And obviously, these type of innovations, driven by very, very strong also innovation on the fundamental metal side, are driving share gain and growth. And that is part of the strength of our downstream business, and we will continue to do it and leverage our core advantages in that. 
At the same time, they are not letting go on the productivity side. You see the productivity gains here of $350 million since 2010, very, very well done.
So that concludes the business side. But before I conclude the presentation entirely, let me also do one deep dive here on the automotive front, because that is a fascinating thing that changes there. Many of you might have heard here in the U.S.  Now, finally, we also are focusing in the U.S. here on fuel efficiency. Regulation has come out here called new CAFE regulation, Corporate Average Fuel Economy. You see that depicted here on the left-hand side. The firms are forced to get up 31% and double their fuel efficiency of their fleet. That's what the automotive companies are legislated to.
At the same time, and that's the middle part here, consumer behavior is shifting. And in 2008, if you looked at the consumer surveys, 54% of the potential buyers of cars would have said, ""I'm willing to pay more for fuel efficiency."" This number is now up to 83%. So basically pretty much everybody says, I mean, ""I'm willing to pay more for more fuel efficiency."" This is obviously also driven by the rising fuel prices that have accelerated, I mean, really during that time frame. 
And actually it's even more interesting when you look at how many people are ranking this even as their #1 factor for buying, and it's 37% that rated as the #1 buying decision, and that's across the different segments. So the car companies have followed up on that, and that's why you see that they're offering fuel-efficient choices pretty much in all segments.
So both of these changes, I mean, the legislation change as well as the consumer demand change, both of those drive light-weighting and drive to get more aluminum into cars, drive for substitution with other material. 
There's been a study out recently that basically it shows that this light-weighting, as an answer to these questions, is a very, very cost-effective solution for the automotive company. That's why we are seeing what we are seeing. 
In addition to that, this allows changes to be done without any compromise on the safety side. Recently again, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration reconfirmed that light-weighting is a choice that allows for the same safety. That's a great thing here. That's a real winner. And that's why you see here on the right-hand side, we believe demand is going to increase 4x by 2016 and going to increase 7.5x by 2020. That's why the expansion in Davenport, which I talked about before, is so important, and that's also why our Middle Eastern project will have an automotive capacity in it.
So let's go to the last slide here. So let me summarize. The industry fundamentals are solid, but the macro sentiment basically dominates. We are delivering strong results. We are controlling our own destiny, and we're not standing still. Upstream, $98 million in performance improvement. We're restructuring our high-cost assets on the midstream, the Global Rolled Products side, record performance, record profitability per metric ton. On the Engineered Products and Solutions business, our downstream business, highest EBITDA margin ever with 20.3%. In addition to that, good cash management, record low third quarter days working capital. 
And on the right-hand side, I just gave you one deep dive here in the automotive market. We continue to aluminize different industries, and that's a good thing.
And let me close here. We don't want to stop our aluminization strategy, so to say, here on earth. We are very proud that we have been part of NASA's Curiosity rover that just landed on Mars. This really connects well to the vision of our founders and enabling mankind's biggest dreams. That's also very much in line with our vision advancing each generation.
So that said, let me open the line for questions."

First thing is, I mean, we don't see any kind of rocks that should rem",499,"Yes, David. That's a good question. And I know that we have talked -- with those that follow us a lot, we've talked about it quite a bit. But I happy to give you a high-level overview. First thing is, I mean, we don't see any kind of rocks that should remain unturned or that should not be questioned. Everybody knows that the business that we have does not, by definition, belong into our portfolio. We actually put it on a test and say we have to prove for every business that we have that we are a better parent to that business than anybody else. And that basically brings out the question of what can Alcoa add in the business as an Alcoa advantage?  And the answer to that, I mean, are multi-fold. I mean, in principle, you see it coming in through technology. You see it in through procurement. It comes in through customer intimacy, customer reach, through the talent management that we have, through the operating system. That's how we can generate value. And basically, you see it very, very nicely in the performances that we have been able to generate in the downstream as well as the midstream business and how we are performing against bringing the upstream business down on the cost curve. So that's basically where we are on that. And I can go into all kinds of examples here. I mean, I could just take out the examples that I used here in my presentation today. I mean, on the EPS business, for instance, the 2 examples on Airbus as well as on Pratt & Whitney. In both cases, these innovations were new alloys. The alloys were not developed in the downstream business. The alloys were developed there where we have the best alloying experts, which is basically in our tech center. This is how we leverage technology as an example. Now you go to the upstream side, and take an example out of this quarter. I mean, this quarter, we have been very, very successful to sign up a new power agreement. We have been successful to sign up power agreements in Brazil as well as in Australia. And that has been because we have been able to develop extremely good government relations to those respective national leaders. They understand what we need to remain competitive. That's another classical parental advantage. But I could go through, I mean, basically each single one of them. Measure us against whether we are able to perform with these businesses better than any other owner, and I think we measure up well. So basically, we've told you what strategy we have. I don't want to get into it in detail, and we also have our Investor Day coming up in November so that we have plenty of time to review it and go into this in detail. We believe that this is the right strategy and the best way to deliver value. Thank you, David."

Yes, we're committed to do almost whatever it takes, and we have shown that through our behavior on the last 4 years. So when the crisis started, if you go back to 2009 and you start looking at our leverage and coverage ratios, obviously, from the amount of debt that we had at that point in time -- at the end of '08, it was $10.6 billion, with $760 million of cash on hand, and the markets were in terrible condition, and we certainly weren't generating a lot of EBITDA. It's considered a down part of the cycle. And I think what we've been able to do with the rating agencies is, each of the years over the last 4 years, is to lay out a plan to them at the beginning of the year on what we were going to do and what we're going to execute against in order to generate cash for the company. And in each of these 4 years, independently, we've been able to achieve every one of those targets. So when you look at our coverage ratios, they fluctuate wildly, obviously, as a result of metal prices. But what we've been able to do is continue to take down our net-debt position, and we are going to be $2 billion better on a net-debt position than we were at the end of 2008. And as long as we continue to execute where we put ourselves in a ""positive free cash flow"" position, I think that will be what's looked at and not necessarily just the gross debt level. Hopefully that helps."

I appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Let's start off with the financial overview for the quarter. Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share. And if you exclude the impact of",2742,"Okay, thanks, Kelly.  Thanks, everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Let's start off with the financial overview for the quarter. Our loss from continuing operations was $143 million or $0.13 a share. And if you exclude the impact of restructuring and special items, it gives us an income from continuing operations of $32 million or $0.03 per share.
Our revenue, EBITDA and ATOI all decreased sequentially, primarily due to lower LME prices. But it's important to note that even though the EBITDA fell to $282 million, adding back the noncash special items would place EBITDA at $496 million in the quarter.
So with that being said, taking a step back, how did we perform in the quarter? We had strong performance in all 4 of our segments. We take a look at the upstream segments, Alumina and Primary, excluding the impact of LME and currency, the combined segments of Alumina and Primary generated $98 million of performance sequentially; and both the Global Rolled Products segment and the Engineered Products and Solutions segment set records in the third quarter. Let me go through a few of those.
In GRP, we had a record third quarter ATOI. We had a record third quarter days working capital, we had record year-to-date ATOI and we had a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton. If you switch over to our Engineered Products and Solutions segment, we had record third quarter ATOI, record quarterly EBITDA margin, record year-to-date ATOI and record year-to-date EBITDA margins.
Obviously, our segments performed extremely well. Taking a look at our core in a consolidated basis, we had a record low days working capital for the third quarter of 33 days, 5 days better than a year ago. Debt-to-capital remained at 36.1%, and our net-debt-to-capital stood at 32.4%. 
Our liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $1.4 billion, and I'll point out that, that excludes $224 million of restricted cash. We had a bond issuance during the quarter, tax-exempt bonds of 30 years issued, and that cash is for the Davenport expansion and is going to stay restricted in order to pay for that expansion.
Okay. With that being said, let's take a look at the income statement. Just going to cover 3 items on the income statement. 
First, revenue. Revenue was down 2% sequentially, driven by lower realized metal prices and weakness in commercial transportation and industrial markets for our Global Rolled Products and nonresidential building and construction in commercial transportation markets for Engineered Products and Solutions. 
COGS as a percent of sales increased sequentially 390 basis points, driven primarily by the environmental and litigation reserves as well as a lower LME. 
And lastly, on this sheet, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.9%. If you exclude discrete items, our operational year-to-date rate is 29%. We would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we'll continue to experience swings in the rate, given the volatility of our profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.  So our results for the quarter, as I said, was $0.13 loss excluding -- including special items.
So let's move on to those special items on the next slide. Special items for the quarter totaled $175 million or $0.16 a share. Let's start out with the environmental reserves. Environmental reserves were increased for 4 sites in the third quarter to reflect the revised cost estimates, of which Grasse River was the largest. On October 1, the EPA released the proposed remedial action plan, with a recommended capping and dredging solution of $243 million. This culminated a 20-year process, which included comprehensive scientific studies to evaluate and determine the recommended approach. It's estimated that the planning and design will take 2 to 3 years, and that will be followed by 4 years of remediation, beginning in 2016.
The next item on reserves was the litigation reserve at $40 million pretax and $15 million after tax. During the quarter, we reached a settlement of the Alba civil suit in the amount of $85 million. 1/2 was paid today, the other half will be paid one year from now. We recorded $40 million charge this quarter in addition to the $45 million charge we recorded in the second quarter. We believe the settlement represents the best possible outcome and avoids the time and expense of complex litigation.
Alcoa and Alba have also entered into an API-based, long-term alumina supply agreement. Resumption of commercial relationship demonstrates the desire to work together as well as the significant value that Alcoa brings to customers in the region, with superior quality and optimal logistics of its alumina.
The $26 million in discrete tax item relates to the interim treatment of losses in jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit. And then we had mark-to-market energy contracts and restructuring charges in the quarter as well. All told, it's $175 million or $0.16 a share of special items. And excluded, it brings our income from continuing operations to $0.03 a share.
Let's move on to the sequential bridge. Our income from continuing operations decreased from $61 million to $32 million or down $29 million sequentially. Obviously, the unfavorable market impact was driven by lower LME prices and unfavorable currency. The A dollar strengthened and was partially offset by weakening of the Brazilian real. 
The $21 million of net cost increases were more than overshadowed by the favorable price mix and productivity in the quarter of $86 million. The cost increases were largely a result of LIFO accrual, which reflected the rebound in metal prices.
We also continued strong productivity across Alumina, Primary Metals and EPS businesses this quarter, driven by higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates, usage reductions and reduced contractual spending. So if you looked at the $94 million of market impact and you were to take the net impact of all of the items and deem them to be performance of $65 million, you would see that we were able to eliminate 70% of the market impact through improved performance, strong performance from an operating basis.
Let's move on now and take a look at each one of the segments. Let's start with the Alumina segment. Production was up 1% as the Australian maintenance overhauls were completed in the second quarter. Shipments were up as a result of the increased production, as well as the tons that were shipped this quarter that were delayed at the end of last quarter.
So if you looked at the operating -- after-tax operating loss of $9 million, it's down $32 million sequentially, driven by price reductions, which impacted earnings by $91 million and $11 million in unfavorable currency.
Offsetting a major portion of the negative market impact of $102 million was $70 million of favorable performance, driven by price mix, productivity and volume. Productivity gains were $23 million. Price mix, a piece of that was driven by API improvement as the Alumina Price Index prices remained flat while the LME declined.
So here again as you look at this segment, you see that 70% of the market impact was reduced by improved performance of $70 million. Looking to fourth quarter guidance in this segment, pricing on Alumina Price Index at 40% of third-party shipments, while other pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Caustic prices are expected to remain flat. API pricing has remained flat as the LME has recently increased since early September, and productivity gains are expected to continue. 
Let's move on to the Primary segment. Revenue is down slightly as higher third-party shipments partially offset the impact of lower LME prices. LME prices were down 7% sequentially on a 15-day-lag basis, with realized prices down 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
The after-tax net operating loss of $14 million is -- from a $3 million in the second quarter for $11 million reduction. 
Starting first with the lower LME prices and currencies.  Combined, they impacted ATOI $38 million negatively. Price mix was a favorable improvement and was driven mostly through regional premiums. In raw materials, we had higher alumina costs but these were partially offset by improving coke and pitch prices. And here, as in alumina, the performance of $27 million offset 70% of the market's deterioration of $38 million.
If you look to the fourth quarter guidance, pricing will continue to follow the 15-day lag.  We anticipate the U.S. hydro asset sale to be completed by the end of the quarter.  We will continue productivity gains. Curtailments will unfavorably impact the fourth quarter ATOI by $15 million. So if you take back and take a step back and look at Alumina and Primary in total, we would expect, excluding LME, currency and the curtailment impact, that the upstream segments on a combined basis would remain flat on a sequential basis.
Let's move to the Global Rolled Products segment. Revenue was down $64 million or 3% sequentially, driven by weaker industrial and commercial transportation markets in Europe. ATOI was $98 million for the quarter, a $3 million sequential improvement and a 63% improvement over third quarter 2011. Price mix was a $19 million improvement, more than offset cost increases and lower volumes. 
I'd like to point out and remind you what we went through last time, and that was a part of the price mix is driven by customer pricing flowing through on a 15- to 30-day period, and inventory cost of metal comes through on a 45- to 90-day basis. So you'd expect compressed margins on falling metal price and increased margins on rising prices.
Cost increases consisted of metal premiums, labor and energy. I think it's important to take time out to look at the records of Global Rolled Products in this quarter. We had record third quarter ATOI of $98 million and adjusted EBITDA of $395 a ton. It's the highest-ever year-to-date ATOI of $289 million.
Year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton was a record at $405 per ton, 72% higher than the 10-year average. Also a record third quarter days working capital, down 5 days on a year-over-year basis. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we would expect aerospace and automotive to continue to be strong. We will see a seasonal demand decrease in packaging. European and North American industrial markets had been weakening, and we have had a corresponding pricing and demand pressures as a result of that.
Excluding the impacts of LME and currency, ATOI is expected to be down 20% to 25% sequentially due to the continuation of weaker industrial markets and the seasonal impact of packaging. 
Now let's move to Engineered Products and Solutions segment. EPS continues its string of strong quarters. ATOI of $160 million is a record third quarter despite the decreased revenue. Third-party revenue was down 4% sequentially, due to seasonal declines in European building and construction and weakness in commercial transportation.
EPS continues its sequential productivity gains of $13 million in the third quarter, which more than offset higher costs in transportation, energy and maintenance. Here again, we had records in this segment: record quarterly EBITDA margin at 20.3%, record year-to-date ATOI of $475 million and record year-to-date EBITDA margin of 19.6%.
As we look to the fourth quarter, in the nonresidential building and construction business, we anticipate continued weakness, particularly in Europe. Heavy-duty truck build rates are expected to continue their decline in North America and Europe. As this is normal for the EPS segment, we anticipate continued share gains and productivity improvements.
If you look back over the last few years, the fourth quarter is generally a slower quarter than the third by about 13% from a profitability standpoint. Due to productivity gains and share gains offsetting weaknesses in commercial transportation and building and construction markets, we would expect a similar percentage decrease this year.
Let's move to the cash flow statement. Let's start with cash from operations. $263 million cash from operations in the quarter led to a negative free cash flow of $39 million. 
If you looked at the second quarter, cash from operations was $537 million, and there's really 3 main reasons for the decline from second quarter to third quarter. One is obviously the lower earnings. The second is interest payments, as we make semiannual interest payments in the first and third quarter. And the third is the tax refund that we garnered in the second quarter of $70 million, which is -- did not recur in the third quarter. Those 3 were partially offset by an improvement in working capital in the quarter.
Jumping to pension contributions, they totaled $163 million in the quarter for a total of $515 million year-to-date, and that represents more than 90% of the total 2012 estimated payments. We anticipate a fourth quarter contribution in the range of $50 million. And right now, we're looking at contributions for 2013 to be in the $450 million to $500 million range.
On a liquidity basis, as I said earlier, our debt-to-cap was at 36.1%, and our net debt-to-cap was 32.4%. Cash remains strong with $1.4 billion on hand, and we had 5-day improvement in days working capital. 
So let's switch now and look at the days working capital slide on the next page.  This is something that we're very proud of inside of the company because 33 days working capital is a record low for the third quarter. In fact, the reason we're proud of it is this is the 12th consecutive quarter we've demonstrated year-over-year improvement.
To give you a sense of what this is worth in terms of dollars, this 5-day improvement is worth about $315 million. And if you were to go back to the 2009 time frame when these initiatives geared up, it's a 15-day improvement, and that's worth about $1 billion. And we expect this trend to continue.
Let's move on to the next slide, please. As we look at this quadrant of slides here, we like to point out our liquidity and how we've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet even in a volatile economic environment. First, let me reiterate that Alcoa is committed to our investment-grade status. That's why we've -- we're in the fourth year now of a Cash Sustainability Program that's allowed us to remain profitable and maintain a stable balance sheet in a very volatile economic environment, as I said.
We've got $1.4 billion of cash on hand. And I will point out again that, that doesn't include $224 million of restricted cash that we have, and we expect to be within our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 35% by year end. 
So let me take this and summarize it for you now. First of all, we're delivering on improvements to performance. We're executing the curtailments that we talked about in our upstream business as we're moving down the cost curve, and we're also generating significant productivity in the upstream in order to move down the cost curve. At the same time, we're setting both quarterly and annual records on margin and profitability in the mid and downstream businesses.
If you look to our annual targets -- first with productivity, give you a sense of where we stand. Our productivity target this year, which is a before-tax number of $800 million, through the first 9 months, we've got $838 million of before-tax productivity gains on a year-over-year basis.
We wanted to save another $50 million in overhead. Through the first 9 months, we're at $57 million. We wanted to be an additional 1.5 days down on working capital. And through the third quarter, we're 5 days better than the third quarter last year, and we anticipate that we will achieve this 1.5 days by year end balance. We had capital spend and investments of $1.7 billion, and we will be within that limit at year end.
Our debt-to-cap will fall within the 30% to 35% range. And most importantly, we anticipated that we had target that we're going to have free cash flow -- positive free cash flow this year. And based on where we stand right now, we still have that target that we're set to achieve for this year. 
So if you looked at it, we're achieving our 1- and 3- to 5-year targets by moving down the cost curve in upstream segment and generating top line growth and increasing margins in our mid and downstream segments. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Klaus."

So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, basi",4157,"Well thank you, Chuck. So in the usual fashion, let's first look at our markets and then take a look at all 4 businesses. So let's start with the end markets.
Overall, as you see here, this is a mixed picture, but we continue to see positive growth, basically, in most of our end markets. Global aerospace remains solid at a 13% to 14% growth. We are pretty confident in that, and our confidence is supported by the continued strong performance in the large commercial aircraft segment. I've said it multiple times, but the backlog is now 8,500 planes, and that is basically in today's production about an 8-year backlog. So this is solid.
Next one is automotive. We have a microphone problem?  No? Okay, the next one is automotive. In the automotive markets, we are seeing an increase of 11% to 15% in North America. It's very interesting. When the September seasonally adjusted annual sales rate came out at 14.9 million cars, this marks the highest selling rate since March 2008, which is basically a plus 15% on a year-to-date basis. That's on top of a plus 15% we saw on a year-to-date basis compared to 2011, so that's a very positive development.
Automotive in Europe continues to decline, we believe, at minus 4% to minus 9%. China feels a bit more stable in the automotive segment. The sales are up on a year-on-year basis 9%, and we expect a plus 4% to 7% growth this year. 
So next segment, heavy truck and trailer. We have lowered our expectation in each of the markets so that globally, we expect a decline of minus 7% to minus 9%. This is substantially down from the minus 3% to the plus 1% that we expected in the second quarter here.
Let me go through it. On the North American side, we've seen the net orders in heavy trucks and trailers fall in the first quarter to the second quarter by 23% and then again from the second to the third quarter by another 13%. Obviously, the truck OEMs have reduced their production in response to that, and we see a decline from the second to the third quarter of 18%. 
Interestingly, when you take a total look at the North American heavy truck picture, up to August, and that's the only time that we have numbers, demand for freight was positive, up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis. So were the truck load rates, they were up 2.4%. That's interesting. And at the same time, the truck fleet is pretty old at 6.6 years now. The 20-year average is at 5.8, so there is a replacement pressure.
But when we took a little bit of a deeper look, we saw that -- particularly the small and the medium-sized operators are concerned. I mean, the message is like fiscal cliff, euro news, China. All of that influence their sentiment. And I guess that, that makes them push their orders out kind of in anticipation of potentially a worry about the future.
On the European heavy truck and trailer side, the registration estimates for the third quarter are down 18% from the second quarter. The OEMs here, we believe, are reducing production. We expect a minus 8% to minus 11%.
China, heavy truck and trailer registration fell by 17% from the second -- from the first quarter to the second, and August and July even looked worse with a minus 31% below the second quarter. So we see production cuts here off the OEMs of around minus 24% from the second to the third quarter.
The next segment is beverage can packaging. We downward-revised our growth expectations for Europe and China. But global growth basically stays at the same 2% to 3%, and that's possible given the relative size of these other markets compared to North America, and North America is actually pretty good and actually looked a little better than what we originally expected.
And last but not least, our outlook for commercial building and construction as well as industrial gas turbines remains unchanged. On the commercial building and construction, it's probably worthwhile to say a few words on the U.S. side. Architecture Billing Index is hovering around the midpoint, and the recent number on August turned positive. But before, they were 4 months down, and that was preceded by 5 months up. So you get a feel for it. It's a pretty fragile environment.
And on top of it, Architectural Billing Index is a nice early indicator. But always keep in mind, it takes 12 to 15 months until this really becomes billings and revenues in the market. So it's preceding a very, very early one.
So much on the building and construction side. On industrial gas turbines, probably one last sentence here. We continue to view the segment as very positive and strongly supported by the increased attractiveness of gas.
So that basically concludes our view on the end market side. Let's now take a look at what does that all mean for the aluminum demand. And we do see a slight slowdown in some regions and end markets and puts a little pressure on the demand growth. So we've lowered our demand projection for this year to 6%, down 1 percentage point from the 7% that we saw before.
Main driver for this is China. We saw in the first half of the year a demand growth of 11%. We believe this is going to come down in the second half to 7%. So you see here the average of this basically gets to 9%. And at the same time, we -- I am pretty confident, given the already-announced China stimulus package, which is going into the ground, I mean, literally speaking, as we speak here, that the demand will be picking up speed.  But this is probably going to take until the end of the fourth quarter. So by that time, we will probably be able to see that in the numbers.
Other than China, outside of China, basically Europe has weakened here. And relatively spoken, the other bright spots of growth are U.S. as well as Middle East. 
So what does all of that mean now for the demand and supply picture? So let's bring on the next slide. Here on the left-hand side, you see the alumina; on the right-hand side, the aluminum. And you can already see by the numbers here, by the sheer size of the numbers or how small these numbers are, it doesn't really matter where exactly they are. I mean, we basically see the markets both are pretty much in balance.
On the left-hand side, the alumina market, if you compare it with what we have before, moves into a slight surplus, and that's very much driven by China. We see lower production in China but we do see higher imports on the alumina side. Imports are up 192% year-over-year. And keep in mind, this is very strongly driven by the Indonesia bauxite ban. 60% of the bauxite in China gets imported, 80% of that used to come from Indonesia. Now it's not coming from there.
What we saw here, if you move to the right-hand side on the aluminum side, the Chinese aluminum market. We see some smelter expansion getting delayed and at the same time also buildup of the alumina reserve. And why do I say that as we are talking on the right-hand side with aluminum? Because what you see here, smelters are basically currently building a reserve on the alumina supply, given the uncertainty of the bauxite respective, the alumina supply situation. And the last thing that they want, they don't want to be caught by surprise and having to slow down or shut down their smelters.  So with all that, with the slowdown of demand, China moves into a slight surplus here. 
The rest of the world remains in a deficit. Demand has declined a bit. But at the same time, we see some production losses as well delays in new projects. So what does that all mean? The aluminum market also is moving or continues to be in a balance.
So let's also take a look at the regional premiums on the next slide. So what you see here is basically depiction of the regional premium over time, and they are up. And this is clearly an indication of the strength of the financial as well as the physical demand that drives tightness in the physical market. Regional premiums continued to rise. This is now the third consecutive quarter, and they have, as you see here, reached new record highs.
So let's move on to the inventory side. I know and I've heard that feedback from outside. This is a complex chart, so hang in with me. I'll run you through this. This actually not as complex as it looks. Let's first take a look at the mountain. The mountain that you see here is basically the stacking up of visible as well as inventory -- as well as invisible inventories. Obviously, that's an estimate, right, of the invisible inventory.
And when you look at the peak point of that mountain and look at where it is today, you actually see that the inventories have declined, in fact, 27 days from their peak in 2009. Compared to last quarter, it's pretty much flat at 75 days of consumption.
Let me also point out one other thing here, in the structure of the mountains, there's this strong yellowish top here on the right-hand side, which is called canceled warrants. And as you can nicely see, this has increased. So this is showing the desire of people wanting to get their metal off the exchange. In a way, it's a good indication for the appeal of financial deals and the type of optimism there in regards to the financial demand here in the mid as well as the long term staying attractive. 
The curve that we have in here, the blue curve that you have in here -- I haven't talked about that. That's the LME price, and I guess most of you guessed that. So now you have to put in perspective the mountain as -- together with where the LME is going. And classical supply and demand logic would indicate, as you see here in the earlier part of that slide, as the mountain builds, the price comes down. Mountain goes down, price goes up. That's exactly how the market is supposed to work. 
But basically in the mid-2011, you do see the market kind of comes down and the price re-syncs very, very strongly. So what is happening here? Why is there this decoupling of the supply and demand side? And that's on the next slide.
What you see here is the bar is basically is the net, the supply and demand balance, so to say. And the curve here is an even more granular LME cash curve in that time frame. So obviously, as the blue bars move up, the metal price comes down. I mean, oversupply, price comes down, so clear. The blue bars go down, metal price goes up. 
And here again, you can see in the mid-2011, these fundamentals seem to get disconnected. And so demand-supply base fundamentals are basically decoupling from the LME pricing. So the real question is what is driving the LME then, if it's not the fundamentals? And you've seen some of that very nice in the next slide. 
So in times of crisis, obviously, that's not the first time that markets are seeing that macro factors can top the fundamentals. And obviously, that's the thing that's happening. Worries around the Eurozone crisis, U.S. debt, fiscal cliff, China slowdown worries. All of that goes in, and that's why we've seen metal price coming down from the $2,800 high in April last year to a low in summer of this year of $1,800, and that's only happened in a little more than a year time frame.
But it's also interesting to note that these things can very, very quickly reverse, as we've recently seen. And we've recently seen this here. This is under the magnifying glass here. We've seen the LME shoot up to $2,200 per metric ton from $1,800 per metric ton. So basically just in 10 days, it shot up. But why did it shoot up? I mean, there were basically 4 announcements that made it shoot up. One was the ECB bond buying program. Preceding that was all the news around will it happen, will it happen, will it happen? That's why you see it coming up, but then, boom, it comes, and it shoots up. 
Next thing, China stimulus plan; next thing, the German Constitutional Court ruling; and the next thing, the QE3 announcement. And wow, it's like a booster here, it shoots up. Nothing of that has changed anything of the fundamentals in our markets, right? So that's what you can clearly see here, the macro factors are currently dominating the pricing situation, but it can reverse very, very quickly as we have seen there.
So let me summarize the market side of things. So the market fundamentals are pretty much intact. We see the market is effectively in balance. On the supply-demand side, premiums remain at a record high. Inventories are down. But currently, the market sentiment dominates the pricing. So that concludes the market side.
Let's now move into our businesses and review our businesses. And let's start with Alumina. And let's start on the upper left-hand side where you see the 10-year profitability. And you see it, it is a lower profitability at this point in time, and that's normal because it reflects the market conditions. But also, I think our actions have allowed us to at least return to profitability on a year-to-date basis. 
Why is that so? Part of it you see on the right upper-hand side because we have changed the pricing. We've changed it from an LME linkage to something that is really more in tune with the fundamentals of this market, which we call Alumina Pricing Index. And we've said that we are not going to sign any contracts based on that old scheme, and that's what we stick by. So by the end of this year, we believe 40% of our customers will be on API or spot basis.
It's also clear, and we see that again reflected on the lower left-hand side, this is a commodity business. So it's all about where you are on the cost curve. We're not that badly positioned here, being on the 30th percentile. But we want to move down 7 percentage points by 2015 to the 23rd percentile. And we believe our actions are going to get us 1 to 3 percentage points down by the end of next year. 
So how are we going to do that? I mean, obviously a lot of that is already in the making. We have curtailed, and that's complete, 390,000 tons basically in our Atlantic region refinery system. We continue to drive productivity, $320 million since 2010.
A major factor here is the thing that we call Center of Excellence in mining and refining. They have one task only. They detect the best practice and they roll it through the system in record speed so that we can really capture the productivity that we generate at all places.
And in addition, cash management, well done, 8 days further down on days working capital, which means $150 million in cash. And then last but not least, Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget. And let me also remind you that this is lowest on the cost curve.
So let's move on to the next segment, the aluminum, our Primary Metals segment. The weakness here in pricing has divorced from the fundamentals of the aluminum industry, and that continues to challenge this segment. Our strategy, however, is, and that holds through, basically the whole upstream business, we focus on the things that we can control to maximize value.
So one of the things that we can control, for instance, is the value-add side here, which basically means optimizing our cast house profitability [ph]. What we've done here in a very systematic way, we're offering our customer value-add product, and we're capturing premiums though this while we're limiting the logistics costs. And that alone has allowed us to add $375 million additional margin. That's very, very good.
While we do that, obviously, the biggest thing here given that, that's a commodity business, is pushing the cost down on the cost curve, 10 percentage points on the 51st percentile to the 41st percentile by 2015. That's our target, and we believe that we're going to get 3 to 6 percentage points out of the system by 2013.
A lot of actions are going on, and those that follow us more closely clearly see that. We have restructured our high cost -- or we are in the process of restructuring our high-cost assets; permanently closed 290,000 tons in Tennessee and Rockdale; partially curtailed Aviles and La Coruña in Spain, high-cost smelters in Spain; and we are moving forward with the curtailment of Italy. More than 70% of our Portovesme smelter is currently closed. This is one of the highest cost smelters in our whole system. Once all of this is complete, which will be soon, 14% of our global smelting system is curtailed.
Productivity gains in addition to that $385 million. We have also been able, and this quarter shows it in a very nice way, to improve our cost of power. This is a major factor here in the cost structure. In the U.S., in Australia and Brazil, in Australia and Brazil, with the great cooperation from the government to help us to remain competitive in this market. In addition to that, strong focus also on the cash side. 9 days out from days working capital equals $240 million in cash. And Saudi Arabia is on schedule and on budget.
The third segment here is our Global Rolled Products, and they continue to show strong performance. And they have achieved a record year-to-date EBITDA per metric ton, $405 per metric ton. Just look at that compared to where the 10-year average is of $235 per metric ton. They are really performing on a different performance level.
And in addition to that, they show solid growth in many segments like automotive, aerospace on a year-on-year basis. Also strong demand on North American packaging side, the utilization of 85% where we are today leaves room to grow. 
Talking about growth. We are preparing for additional growth in the automotive segment, and I'll talk about that at the very end a little bit. Our Davenport expansion is the biggest factor here. It's on time, on budget, and we will be able to roll the first car off in end of December of 2013. 
At the same time, we continue to move our existing business, productivity gains of $280 million, and we focus also here on the cash, 3 days of working capital out will give us additional $60 million compared to 2010. It's actually 5 days, if you compare it to last year.
Our fourth segment is the Engineered Products and Solutions business, and that achieved another record quarter. We now have an EBITDA margin that's above 20%, beside 20.3% in the third quarter. That's excellent performance.
If you look at the upper right-hand side, on the aerospace side, our utilization remained at 78%. And on the other businesses, due to the weakness on the commercial transportation as well as building and construction, it's down from 69% to 65% compared to the last, last, last quarter here.
The lower left-hand side there, that's a complicated one. But I'll tell you what it depicts. I mean, we are continuing to drive innovation. And when Airbus earlier this year came to us to introduce a very, very cool concept, the Sharklet, you see it depicted here. This is the thing that tips up the end of the wing and gives a massive, massive fuel efficiency improvement. We developed the extruded stringer with the new patented alloy. That alone allows 3.7% higher strength-to-weight ratio, which results in a fuel-burn reduction of 3.5%. That's great. 
And that's not the only thing that happened on the innovation front. An equally great one is the other one that's depicted here. This is a very, very interesting new turbine, new jet engine by Pratt & Whitney called The Geared Turbofan. And we have been able to place our ultra-efficient lightweight, low-speed blade made of aluminum-lithium in there. And obviously, these type of innovations, driven by very, very strong also innovation on the fundamental metal side, are driving share gain and growth. And that is part of the strength of our downstream business, and we will continue to do it and leverage our core advantages in that. 
At the same time, they are not letting go on the productivity side. You see the productivity gains here of $350 million since 2010, very, very well done.
So that concludes the business side. But before I conclude the presentation entirely, let me also do one deep dive here on the automotive front because that is a fascinating thing that changes there. Many of you might have heard here in the U.S.  Now, finally, we also are focusing in the U.S. here on fuel efficiency. Regulation has come out here called new CAFE regulation, Corporate Average Fuel Economy. You see that depicted here on the left-hand side. The firms are forced to get up 31% and double their fuel efficiency of their fleet. That's what the automotive companies are legislated to.
At the same time, and that's the middle part here, consumer behavior is shifting. And in 2008, if you looked at the consumer surveys, 54% of the potential buyers of cars would have said, ""I'm willing to pay more for fuel efficiency."" This number is now up to 83%. So basically pretty much everybody says, I mean, ""I'm willing to pay more for more fuel efficiency."" This is obviously also driven by the rising fuel prices that have accelerated, I mean, really during that time frame. 
And actually it's even more interesting when you look at how many people are ranking this even as their #1 factor for buying, and it's 37% that rated as the #1 buying decision, and that's across the different segments. So the car companies have followed up on that, and that's why you see that they're offering fuel efficient choices pretty much in all segments.
So both of these changes, I mean, the legislation change as well as the consumer demand change, both of those drive light-weighting and drive to get more aluminum into cars, drive for substitution with other material. 
There's been a study out recently that basically it shows that this light-weighting, as an answer to these questions, is a very, very cost-effective solution for the automotive company. That's why we are seeing what we are seeing. 
In addition to that, this allows changes to be done without any compromise on the safety side. Recently again, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration reconfirmed that light-weighting is a choice that allows for the same safety. That's a great thing here. That's a real winner. And that's why you see here on the right-hand side, we believe demand is going to increase 4x by 2016 and going to increase 7.5x by 2020. That's why the expansion in Davenport, which I talked about before, is so important, and that's also why our Middle Eastern project will have an automotive capacity in it.
So let's go to the last slide here. So let me summarize. The industry fundamentals are solid, but the macro sentiment basically dominates. We are delivering strong results. We are controlling our own destiny and we're not standing still. Upstream, $98 million in performance improvement. We're restructuring our high-cost assets on the midstream, the Global Rolled Products side, record performance, record profitability per metric ton. On the Engineered Products and Solutions business, our downstream business, highest EBITDA margin ever with 20.3%. In addition to that, good cash management, record low third quarter days working capital. 
And on the right-hand side, I just gave you one deep dive here in the automotive market. We continue to aluminize different industries, and that's a good thing.
And let me close here. We don't want to stop our aluminization strategy, so to say, here on earth. We are very proud that we have been part of NASA's Curiosity rover that just landed on Mars. This really connects well to the vision of our founders and enabling mankind's biggest dreams. That's also very much in line with our vision advancing each generation.
So that said, let me open the line for questions."

And I know that we have talked -- with those that follow us a lot, we've talked about it quite a bit. But I’m happy to give you a high-level overview. First thing is, I mean, we don't see any kind of rocks that should remain unturned or that should not be questioned. Everybody knows that the business that we have does not, by definition, belong into our portfolio. We actually put it on a test and say we have to prove for every business that we have that we are a better parent to that business than anybody else. And that basically brings out the question of what can Alcoa add in the business as an Alcoa advantage?  And the answer to that, I mean, are multi-fold. I mean, in principle, you see it coming in through technology. You see it in through procurement. It comes in through customer intimacy, customer reach, through the talent management that we have, through the operating system. That's how we can generate value. And basically, you see it very, very nicely in the performances that we have been able to generate in the downstream as well as the midstream business and how we are performing against bringing the upstream business down on the cost curve. So that's basically where we are on that. And I can go into all kinds of examples here. I mean, I could just take out the examples that I used here in my presentation today. I mean, on the EPS business, for instance, the 2 examples on Airbus as well as on Pratt & Whitney. In both cases, these innovations were new alloys. The alloys were not developed in the downstream business. The alloys were developed there where we have the best alloying experts, which is basically in our tech center. This is how we leverage technology as an example. Now you go to the upstream side, and take an example out of this quarter. I mean, this quarter, we have been very, very successful to sign up a new power agreement. We have been successful to sign up power agreements in Brazil as well as in Australia. And that has been because we have been able to develop extremely good government relations to those respective national leaders. They understand what we need to remain competitive. That's another classical parental advantage. But I could go through, I mean, basically each single one of them. Measure us against whether we are able to perform with these businesses better than any other owner, and I think we measure up well. So basically, we've told you what strategy we have. I don't want to get into it in detail, and we also have our Investor Day coming up in November so that we have plenty of time to review it and go into this in detail. We believe that this is the right strategy and the best way to deliver value. Thank you, David."

A lot of investors are looking at Alcoa from a debt-to-EBITDA perspective, which is a metric that the rating agencies talk to. And so can you talk to just on a forward-looking basis what measures Alcoa would be willing to take to look to reduce the debt side of the equation? And what you'd really be willing to do to maintain the investment-grade rating? Would you consider issuing equity either to reduce absolute debt or to pay the pension again in 2013?"

Yes, we're committed to do almost whatever it takes, and we have shown that through our behavior on the last 4 years. So when the crisis started, if you go back to 2009 and you start looking at our leverage and coverage ratios, obviously, from the amount of debt that we had at that point in time -- at the end of '08, it was $10.6 billion, with $760 million of cash on hand, and the markets were in terrible condition, and we certainly weren't generating a lot of EBITDA. It's considered a down part of the cycle. And I think what we've been able to do with the rating agencies is, each of the years over the last 4 years, is to lay out a plan to them at the beginning of the year on what we were going to do and what we're going to execute against in order to generate cash for the company. And in each of these 4 years, independently we've been able to achieve every one of those targets. So when you look at our coverage ratios, they fluctuate wildly, obviously, as a result of metal prices. But what we've been able to do is continue to take down our net-debt position, and we are going to be $2 billion better on a net-debt position than we were at the end of 2008. And as long as we continue to execute where we put ourselves in a positive free cash flow position, I think that will be what's looked at and not necessarily just the gross debt level. Hopefully that helps."

I mean, the market today is basically driven by headlines and not the market fundamentals. We are focusing on whatever we can control. And as you hopefully are seeing, we're executing well against that. We're capitalizing on the strong pockets of growth and are driving profitability. You see that very clearly in the mid and the downstream segment but also in the upstream segment because there, we are focusing on reducing costs as well as optimizing our asset base to get it lower on the cost curve. We have shown sustained improvement in productivity in all of the 3 groups, and we intend to continue that. Our strategy basically is made for also carrying us well through volatile economic conditions. We are confident that we can and will control our destiny. And the outlook on alumina and aluminum is positive. We see a lot of opportunities going forward. We believe that the demand is going to double in this decade for aluminum. So these fundamentals are all nicely in place. So thank you very much for joining us, and goodbye."
