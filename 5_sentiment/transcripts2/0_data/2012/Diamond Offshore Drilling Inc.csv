I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about the market.

I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about the market. We do not have any banner day right to announce today nor have we announced any recently, but that doesn't mean that there's not intense interest in a number of our rigs across a number of markets.
If we just back up for a little bit and put this in perspective on where the market is now versus where it was a year ago, we're seeing a very strong market. We're seeing that the continuation of oil prices at or above $100 for that time period is obviously, having in our judgment an impact on our customer as they take this oil price in and become increasingly comfortable with that is the go forward price that they can count on. We've had the North Sea firm up a year ago. We had very little forward visibility. We're concerned about working rigs to the winter. And now we've got backlog in place. We're returning The Guardian from the Falkland Islands to that market for a term contract. And in addition to that, Mexico has really come on very strong. We currently have 4 jack-ups and a semi in that market. A year ago, we had 2 jack-ups there, with less than a year of forward visibility. And now we're right at 10 years of commitment spread across those 5 rigs. So Mexico stepping forward, taking up jack-ups, bringing in floaters, is certainly also a real net positive we believe. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to take rigs out of that market, so we're now down to one jack-up and one semi, the Ocean Victory. We've got good demand for both units. We're seeing in the jack-up front to a number of small players that are seeking to find well places, among other things to put the jack-ups to work. And it really with just our soul semi and the 3 of 6,000-foot market, was very little competition. We're seeing great interest in that particular unit as well. Over in Indonesia, where we have had a presence since the early '80s, we were down to our core jack-up over there, the Ocean Sovereign's has been cold stack and we had the ocean row working in that short term period but since then we've committed the Ocean Monarch for a full-year program. So we're glad to continue in that area. And I think that also shows just that you've got lots of interest around the world in areas in that people believe that they can develop lots of production and that will be profitable at these type of pay rates.
And then the most recent activity that we've gotten is the announcement of the construction of the Ocean Onyx. That has begun in Brownsville and we're targeting a mid '13 delivery on that unit. So the quick turnaround is certainly an advantage to us, as is the low capital costs of approximately $300 million. And we've got interest in that unit already. We're not ready to comment particularly where that market is, but I think if you watch the Ocean Victory, which is a similar rig, the Onyx will have more capability for sure, but they will service several markets and as you see what sort of commitment you may have on Ocean Victory at the going forward I think that will give you a good clue on what the demand might be pretty Ocean Onyx certainly in the.Gulf of Mexico. And of course, the new interest in it in another Atlantic base in areas that we could put the vessel to work.
Following the Ocean Onyx, we have one more opportunity to do a similar development where we could deliver new capacity to the fourth generation market. And we're pursuing that from an engineering standpoint at this point and don't have anything else to announce on that.
And then finally, last year, we did commit the Ocean BlackHawk and BlackHornet to Anadarko, and we have one more rig in that class to be marked. There's a lot of rigs at that delivery point, so I won't necessarily look at this moment that we're going to have a commitment for it. But as we look forward to demand, we're very comfortable that virtually all of the rigs that are being constructed in that timeframe will be committed. And of course, the Ocean BlackRhino, we think that's the coolest name in the whole oil field. And we hope that our customers will think the same thing.
So with that sort of my commentary on the market. Gary Krenek will be talking about cost guidance, but let me comment a little bit on that. Obviously for the quarter, we were mostly impacted by a very favorable change in our tax rate and Gary will talk about that, but from our operational standpoint, I'm pleased with our execution. We have 146 days of unanticipated equipment downtime, which is up from an average of about 85 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year, but well within our target operational envelope. And so we're pleased with that.
We have 570 days of shipyard on mobe time and of course that, we try to provide guidance which you know that, that's coming and that was up from what we've been experiencing during the year. We've got a number of surveys on a go-forward basis but we think that's a large number and we believe that, that would come down.
Our OpEx was also within guidance, I believe. Recently, Gary had indicated that our total OpEx would be right at 1.5 billion for the entire year and we came in at $1.50 billion, which we'll declare victory on that, that we were comfortable going forward.
So really the story at Diamond Offshore we'll be watching the market in the coming year, in the coming quarters to see what sort of commitments we have there and then we will continue to work very hard execute to deliver on the dayrates that we have both from a downsizing and from an operating costs.
So that end of the turn it over to Gary and let him elaborate on some of the numbers that is operative quarter."

This comin",1892,"Okay, thanks, Larry. I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter, and then we'll go into some details as to what we expect to see in the coming year in 2012.
For the quarter just ended, we had net income of $198 million or $1.36 per share. This coming on-contract drilling revenues was $734 million. As Larry said, the -- our down time for planned regulatory surveys and shipped downtime was up in the fourth quarter, just as we had forecasted it would be and that impacted our revenues. And of course, impacted the bottom line, but a total of 5 rigs in the shipyard in the fourth quarter amidst almost all of the quarter and were up dayrate. We also had additional 4 rigs that we're mobing in various areas in the world and mobing 2 contracts and that affected us in the fourth quarter.
Again, all of these came in about at the amount of time that we had forecast and have released on our rig status reports earlier.
The big thing that impacted positively the quarter was the tax rate and I'll talk about that in just a second. Getting a little bit more specific on some of the line items in the income statement in Q4. Contract drilling expenses, we guided in our last conference call and said that they will come in between $410 million to $420 million, that actually came in at $407 million, so just slightly our guidance. As Larry said, the cost control is a top priority here at Diamond Offshore and we continue to follow through on that and provide numbers set within our guidance or slightly below.
G&A and interest expense came in close to what we had indicated in our last conference call. Depreciation expense was slightly below our expectations and this was due to a normal year-end adjustment. We work our depreciation through the year and have to true it up at the end of the year. We ultimately understood our capital by about $25 million in 2011 and this gave rise to the fourth quarter adjustment that we had, it was about $6 million. So other than that, we would have come in within the guidance of the depreciation.
The big thing of course in the quarter was the tax -- effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the fourth -- for the year was 18.4%. We had expected it to come in at somewhere between 21% and 24%. And there's a couple of reasons for the lower rate. But first of all in the fourth quarter, we had reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, for your accounting and touch type, it's been 48 accrual. We had some time-sensitive issues in that accrual of that current in December, actually at the end of December. And as a result, cost us to book some credits to our tax expense as these items expired. They were items that we could not anticipate but for GAAP reasons could not recognize until the timing actually expired on these items and therefore, it drove our tax expense for the quarter down.
We also had our normal year-end true up, domestic versus foreign earnings and also where we're earning those foreign earnings at. We do report that every quarter, in accordance with the GAAP, but you're still always working with estimates until the fourth quarter actually get to work with actual numbers and that cost the rate to change a little bit.
So our rate actually was down a couple of percentage points lower for the year than what we had anticipated, but because we have to book that a key militant adjustment in the fourth quarter cost that Q4 tax rate to be 7.5%.
And I'll talk about the mix tax rate in a second. As Larry said, we had forecasted our rig operating expense or contract drilling expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. We did that in our fourth quarter conference call a year ago. They came in at $1.550 billion. And so we'll declare a victory there. I think we gave pretty good job. Looking forward to 2012, we're forecasting those same contract drilling expenses to increase by about $100 million and be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.650 billion. The increase was due to a couple of things. First of all, we are anticipating doing 12 special surveys this year, 11 floater rigs and 1 jack-up.
This will also of course have an impact on down days in our revenues, and rather than going through the detail there, I'd punch you through our rig status report that we issued yesterday evening or we also have on our website to see the timing of those surveys and the actual number of the down days expected with all of them.
We also have -- are seeing some increases in labor cost in the industry along with training costs, as we gear up for additional rigs coming into our fleet. These 2 items will make up the bulk of the remaining increase in cost '11 over '12.
There is some general inflation that we're seeing in the industry. However, that will for the most part, we believe be offset by the fact that we cul-de-sac a couple of rigs in 2011. We incurred the cost in '11 for those rigs, so it won't be incurred in '12. And so that savings we believe offset the general inflation.
Again, contract drilling expenses from about $1.650 billion for 2012. Just a little bit more color on that. During the year, we expect to see normal rig operating cost as we always do, plus the survey cost for the 12 rigs that we'll have coming into survey.
Those survey cost we believe will run as in addition to the normal cost about $5 million to $7 million additional above operating cost for each of the rigs, with the exception being the worker in the start, but we think those cost will be $8 million to $10 million above the operating -- normal operating cost. In conversely, the Guardian and the, I think will be somewhere in the $3 million to $5 million range for the fourth survey and repair type loss.
Mobe -- amortization mobilization cost for 2012, we believe will come in somewhere around $90 million. First quarter, we will incur about $45 million of that $90 million. The remaining Q2 through Q4 will be somewhere in the $14 million to $16 million range. 1Q will be high for 2 reasons. Number one, in 2011, we mobed the Ocean Monarch in the Gulf of Mexico to Southeast Asia. The initial work on that rig when we got there was a 4-month job. We've since signed that up and that rig is committed for an additional 4 years but because of the accounting rules, we're having to amortized that mobe over it just the initial 4 months job.
The rig got to Southeast Asia in December, so we recorded a little bit of that in the fourth quarter this year, but we'll write the rest of that mobe off in the first quarter.
Also we have Guardian that is mobing from the bulk of Islands to the Northeast, so we'll do a survey not see and work shale but again accounting rules because we're going to a survey requires us to expand that mobe currently rather than our sizing over the length of the contract. So we'll see $45 million in Q1 for that.
Again, I'll remind everyone that these amortized mobe cost for the most part are offset by amortized mobe revenues that we've received. As always, I remind everyone that I've been talking about the line in our income statement contract drilling expenses only. These numbers do not include cost incurred in the line reimbursable expenses. We give no guidance for reimbursable expenses, nor do we give guidance for reimbursable revenues. If you look at that, they almost always net to a very immaterial amount.
So that was $1.650 million contract drilling expenses only. Looking at just the first quarter of 2012 for contract drilling expenses, we believe Q1 will come in somewhere in the $405 million to $420 million range. This will be comprised of normal rig operating costs. The Baroness survey costs, the Baroness we'll do in Q1 and the mobe cost and I talked about earlier. Other line items in 2012, G&A, we believe will be flat with the prior year and be somewhere in the $17 million to $18 million range each quarter.
Depreciation goes up slightly due to capital expenditures and will be in the $105 million to $108 million range per quarter. And interest expense or gross interest on our debt is $22 million per quarter. We will be capitalizing a portion of that during the year. We estimate right now approximately $8 million per quarter, which will give us a net interest expense on the P&L statement of approximately $14 million.
Looking at the tax rate, for 2012. We are right now estimating net tax rate to be somewhere in the 27% to 29% range. So a pretty significant increase over 2011. There are a number of reasons for that. First of all, expiration of the tax interest build, which expired on December 31 this past year. This law included the provisions which allowed the company to defer recognizing certain foreign earnings as U.S. taxable income until such earnings are repatriated back to the U.S.
The exploration of this law, certain foreign incomes will now be taxed currently in the U.S, thus increasing our effective tax rate for the year.
Secondly, for the past 15 years, we recorded a tax deduction or amortization associated with our acquisition of Veracruz drilling back in 1995. Those deductions were fully amortized last year and thus, we don't have the benefit of those deductions in 2012 or any time thereafter.
Third, as I said earlier, we had a fourth quarter reduction of our fin 48 accrual. This reduced our overall tax rate to 2011 and we're not able to forecast any similar reduction to 2012. So we're not going to see a credit for that. We don't believe at this time in 2012. And finally, the normal mixture between domestic and foreign earnings always has an effect on our tax rate. We put that into our model, watch it through and as a result, take all of these things on account, we now expect a 27% to 29% tax rate. We'll of course be updating that quarterly as the year progresses.
And finally, capital expenditures for the coming year, we believe we'll see maintenance capital of $330 million. Our guidance last year was $300 million, we came in about $275 million. So we had some rollover into 2012. So when you take that into account, maintenance capital is about flat year-over-year.
And then we also expect to record about $220 million of capital for our newbuild rigs. Primarily the Onyx but we'll also see some capitalized cost for oversight of the drilled ships and of course, the capitalized interest in those ships. So in total, we expect to see $550 million of CapEx for the year.
Approximately $100 million of that will be spent we believe in Q1. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

And now at these dayrates, as you can imagine our customers intensely focused on trying to reduce nonproductive time. So we actually lose ground over time in that, they maybe ready to go. So we don't get as much downtime. And we're pushing wherever we can to expand that, but that's an ongoing process. There's other issues as well on the contracts.

So we are continuing. We've got a stronger market. We've got rigs down in Mexico. So we're working very hard to up the contributions they make, but this remains primarily a floater company and that's, that's the way we see it going forward."

Well, I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about the market. We do not have any banner dayrates to announce today nor have we announced any recently, but that doesn't mean that there's not intense interest in a number of our rigs across a number of markets.
If we just back up for a little bit and put this in perspective on where the market is now versus where it was a year ago, we're seeing a very strong market. We're seeing that the continuation of oil prices at or above $100 for that time period is obviously having, in our judgment, an impact on our customer as they take this oil price in and become increasingly comfortable that, that is the go-forward price that they can count on. 
We've had the North Sea firm up a year ago. We had very little forward visibility. We're concerned about working rigs through the winter, and now we've got backlog in place. We're returning the Guardian from the Falkland Islands to that market for a term contract. 
And in addition to that, Mexico has really come on very strong. We currently have 4 jack-ups and a semi in that market. A year ago, we had 2 jack-ups there, with less than a year of forward visibility. And now we're right at 10 years of commitment spread across those 5 rigs. So Mexico stepping forward, taking up jack-ups, bringing in floaters, is certainly also a real net positive we believe. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to take rigs out of that market, so we're now down to one jack-up and one semi, the Ocean Victory. We've got good demand for both units. We're seeing in the jack-up front that there's a number of small players that are seeking to find well places, oil plays, among other things to put jack-ups to work. And then really with just our sole semi and the 3 of 6,000-foot market, with very little competition, we're seeing great interest in that particular unit as well. 
Over in Indonesia, where we have had a presence since the early '80s, we were down to our core jack-up over there. The Ocean Sovereign has since been cold stacked, and we had the Ocean Rover working in that market for a short-term period. But since then, we've committed the Ocean Monarch for a full year program, so we're glad to continue in that area. And I think that also shows just that you've got lots of interest around the world in areas that people believe that they can develop lots of production that will be profitable at these type of dayrates.
And then the most recent activity that we've gotten is the announcement of the construction of the Ocean Onyx. That has begun in Brownsville, and we're targeting a mid '13 delivery on that unit. So the quick turnaround is certainly an advantage to us as is the low capital cost of approximately $300 million, and we've got interest in that unit already. We're not ready to comment particularly on where that market is. But I think if you watch the Ocean Victory, which is a similar rig, the Onyx will have more capability for sure, but they will service similar market. And as you see what sort of commitments we may have on Ocean Victory going forward, I think that will give you a good clue on where the demand might be for the Ocean Onyx, certainly, in the.Gulf of Mexico. And of course, there was new interest in it in other Atlantic Basin areas that we could put the vessel to work.
Following the Ocean Onyx, we have one more opportunity to do a similar development where we could deliver new capacity to the fourth-generation market. And we're pursuing that from an engineering standpoint at this point and don't have anything else to announce on that.
And then finally, over the past year, we did commit the Ocean BlackHawk and BlackHornet to Anadarko, and we have one more rig in that class to be marked. There's a lot of rigs at that delivery point, so I wouldn't necessarily look at this moment that we're going to have a commitment for it. But as we look forward to demand, we're very comfortable that virtually all of the rigs that are being constructed in that time frame will be committed. And of course, the Ocean BlackRhino, we think that's the coolest name in the whole oil field, and we hope that our customers will think the same thing.
So with the -- that is sort of my commentary on the market. Gary Krenek will be talking about cost guidance, but let me comment a little bit on that. Obviously for the quarter, we were mostly impacted by a very favorable change in our tax rate, and Gary will talk about that. But from our operational standpoint, I'm pleased with our execution. We had 146 days of unanticipated equipment downtime, which is up from an average of about 85 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year, but well within our target operational envelope. And so we're pleased with that.
We had 570 days of shipyard on mobe time. And of course, that we try to provide guidance so that you know that, that's coming, and that was up from what we've been experiencing during the year. We've got a number of surveys on a go-forward basis, but we think that, that's a large number. And we believe that, that would come down.
Our OpEx was also within guidance, I believe. Recently, Gary had indicated to you that our total OpEx would be right at $1.5 billion for the entire year, and we came in at $1.550 billion, which we'll declare victory on that, that we were comfortable going forward.
So really the story at Diamond Offshore, we'll be watching the market in the coming year, in the coming quarters to see what sort of commitments we have there. And then we will continue to work very hard to execute, to deliver on the dayrates that we have, both from a downtime standpoint from an operating cost.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary and let him elaborate on some of the numbers that you saw for the quarter."

Thanks, Larry. I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter, and then we'll go into some detail as to what we expect to see in the coming year in 2012.
For the quarter just ended, we had net income of $188 million or $1.36 per share, this coming on contract drilling revenues of $734 million. As Larry said, the -- our downtime for planned regulatory surveys and shipyard downtime was up in the fourth quarter, just as we had forecasted it would be, and that impacted our revenues and of course, then impacted the bottom line. But a total of 5 rigs in the shipyard in the fourth quarter had missed all or most of the quarter and were off dayrate. 
We also had an additional 4 rigs that we're mobing to various areas in the world, mobing 2 contracts, and that affected us in the fourth quarter. Again, all of these came in about at the amount of time that we had forecast and have released on our rig status reports earlier. The big thing that impacted positively the quarter was the tax rate, and I'm going to talk about that in just a second. 
Looking -- getting a little bit more specific on some of the line items in the income statement for Q4. Contract drilling expenses, we guided in our last conference call and said that they will come in between $410 million to $420 million. That actually came in at $407 million, so just slightly our guidance. As Larry said, cost control is a top priority here at Diamond Offshore, and we continue to follow through on that and provide numbers set within our guidance or slightly below.
G&A and interest expense came in close to what we had indicated in our last conference call. Depreciation expense was slightly below our expectations, and this was due to a normal year-end adjustment. We booked our depreciation through the year and have to true it up at the end of the year. We ultimately underspent our capital by about $25 million in 2011, and this gave rise to the fourth quarter adjustment that we had. It was about $6 million. So other than that, we would have come in within the guidance of the depreciation.
The big thing, of course, in the quarter was the tax -- effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the fourth -- for the year was 18.4%. We had expected it to come in at somewhere between 21% and 24%, and there's a couple of reasons for the lower rate. But first of all, in the fourth quarter, we had reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, for your accounting and tax type, such as FIN 48 accrual. We have some time-sensitive issues in that accrual that turned in December -- actually, at the end of December and as a result, caused us to book some credits to our tax expense as these items expired. They were items that we could not anticipate but for GAAP reasons, could not recognize until the timing actually expired on these items. And therefore, it drove our tax expense for the quarter down.
We also had our normal year-end true up, domestic versus foreign earnings and also where we're earning those foreign earnings at. We do report tax rate every quarter in accordance with GAAP. Whether you're still always working with estimates, we, finally, in the fourth quarter, get to work with actual numbers and that caused the rate to change a little bit.
So the -- our rate actually was down a couple of percentage points lower for the year than what we had anticipated. But because we had to book that accumulative adjustment in the fourth quarter, it caused the Q4 tax rate to be 7.5%. And I'll talk about the next year's tax rate in a second. 
As Larry said, we had forecasted our rig operating expense or contract drilling expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. We did that in our fourth quarter conference call a year ago. They came in at $1.550 billion. And so as he said, we'll declare victory there and think we did a pretty good job. 
Looking forward to 2012, we're forecasting those same contract drilling expenses to increase by about $100 million and be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.650 billion. The increase are due to a couple of things. First of all, we are anticipating doing 12 special surveys this year, 11 floater rigs and one jack-up. This will also, of course, have an impact on down days in our revenues. And rather than going through the detail there, I'd point you to our rig status report that we issued yesterday evening, or we also have on our website to see the timing of those surveys and the actual number of the down days expected with all of them. We also have -- are seeing some increases in labor cost in the industry, along with training costs, as we gear up for additional rigs coming into our fleet. These 2 items will make up the bulk of the remaining increase in cost '11 over '12. 
There is some general inflation that we're seeing in the industry. However, that will for the most part, we believe, be offset by the fact that we cold stacked a couple of rigs in 2011. We incurred the cost in '11 for those rigs. We won't incur it in '12. And so that savings will, we believe, offset the general inflation. Again, contract drilling expenses from about $1.650 billion for 2012. 
Just a little bit more color on that. During the year, we expect to see normal rig operating costs, as we always do, plus the survey costs for the 12 rigs that we'll have coming into survey. Those survey costs, we believe, will run us, in addition to their normal cost, about $5 million to $7 million additional above operating cost for each of the rigs, with the exception being the worker in the Star. But we think those cost will be $8 million to $10 million above the operating -- normal operating cost. And conversely, the Guardian and the King, we think, will be somewhere in the $3 million to $5 million range with the surveying and repair-type cost.
Mobe and amortized mobilization cost for 2012, we believe, will come in somewhere around $90 million. First quarter, we will incur about $45 million of that $90 million. The remaining Q2 through Q4 will be somewhere in the $14 million to $16 million range. Q1 will be high for 2 reasons: Number one, in 2011, we mobed the Ocean Monarch from the Gulf of Mexico to Southeast Asia. The initial work on that rig when we got there was a 4-month job. We have since signed that up, and that rig is committed for an additional 4 years. But because of accounting rules, we are having to amortized that mobe over just the initial 4-months job. The rig got to Southeast Asia in December, so we recorded a little bit of that in the fourth quarter this year. But we'll write the rest of that mobe off in the first quarter.
Also, we have the Guardian that is mobing from the Falkland Islands to the North Sea. It will do its survey in the North Sea and then go work for a 2-year commitment with Shell. But again, accounting rules, because we're going to a survey, requires us to expense that mobe currently rather than amortizing it over the length of the contract. So we'll see $45 million in Q1 for that.
Again, I would remind everyone that these amortized mobe cost for the most part are offset by amortized mobe revenues that we've received. As always, I remind everyone that I've been talking about the line in our income statement, contract drilling expenses only. But these numbers do not include cost incurred in the line, reimbursable expenses. We give no guidance for reimbursable expenses nor do we give guidance for reimbursable revenues. If you look at that, they almost always net to a very immaterial amount. So that was $1.650 million contract drilling expenses only. 
Looking at just the first quarter of 2012 for contract drilling expenses, we believe Q1 will come in somewhere in the $405 million to $420 million range. This will be comprised of the normal rig operating cost; the Baroness survey cost, the Baroness, we'll do in Q1; and then the mobe cost that I talked about earlier. 
Other line items in 2012. G&A, we believe, will be flat with the prior year. It'd be somewhere in the $17 million to $18 million range each quarter. Depreciation goes up slightly due to capital expenditures and will be in the $105 million to $108 million range per quarter. And interest expense, our gross interest on our debt is $22 million per quarter. We will be capitalizing a portion of that during the year. We estimate right now approximately $8 million per quarter, which will give us a net interest expense on the P&L statement of approximately $14 million.
Looking at the tax rate for 2012. We are right now estimating net tax rate to be somewhere in the 27% to 29% range, so a pretty significant increase over 2011. There are a number of reasons for that. First of all, expiration of the tax extenders bill build, which expired on December 31 of this past year. This law included the provision that allowed the company to defer, recognizing certain foreign earnings as U.S. taxable income, until such earnings are repatriated back to the U.S. With the expiration of this law, certain foreign incomes will now be taxed currently in the U.S, thus increasing our effective tax rate for the year.
Secondly, for the past 15 years, we've recorded a tax deduction or amortization associated with our acquisition of Arethusa drilling back in 1995. Those deductions were fully amortized last year and thus, we don't have benefit of those deductions in 2012 or any time thereafter.
Third, as I said earlier, we had a fourth quarter reduction of our FIN 48 accrual. This reduced our overall tax rate to 2011, and we're not able to forecast any similar reduction to -- for 2012. So we're not going to see a credit for that, we don't believe, at this time in 2012. And finally, the normal mixture between domestic and foreign earnings always has an effect on our tax rate. We've put that into our model, wash it through. And as a result, take all of these things in account, we now expect a 27% to 29% tax rate. We'll, of course, be updating that quarterly as the year progresses.
And finally, capital expenditures for the coming year, we believe we'll see maintenance capital of $330 million. Our guidance last year was $300 million. We came in at about $275 million, so we had some rollover into 2012. So when you take that into account, maintenance capital is about flat year-over-year. And then we also expect to record about $220 million of capital for our new build rigs, primarily the Onyx, but we'll also see some capitalized cost for oversight of the drill ships and of course, the capitalized interest on the drill ships. So in total, we expect to see $550 million of CapEx for the year. Approximately $100 million of that will be spent, we believe, in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

I guess -- and you might have gone over this a little bit, but the kind of channel checks we're doing in the industry seem to indicate a lot of uncertainty into how to kind of write the contracts in the post-Macondo world. How do you kind of decipher between who's paying for the downtime, if you have to pull a BOP and all the new regulatory issues? Could you maybe talk to a little bit of that? And I think it's been kind of handed to me that a lot of it has to do with how the manufacturers recommend the kind of maintenance cycle on a BOP, and so it needs to get rewritten into the contracts as unpaid or paid downtime. And how does the new contracts compare to the older legacy contracts that we're currently working off right now? Long-winded question, but hopefully, you got that."

And of course, that's quite a bit different from where we are today. We've seen over the past 5 or 6 years just a change in operations in that. It used to be that it would take more time to move from one location to set up another well, and you would have a normal 2 or 3 days built-in, where you could perform your maintenance on the BOP stack. And now at these dayrates, as you can imagine, our customers are intensely focused on trying to reduce nonproductive time. So we actually lose ground over time, and that they maybe ready to go. And so we don't get as much downtime. And we're pushing wherever we can to expand that, but that's an ongoing process. There's other issues as well on the contracts. Michael, you have any things you've noted."

Well, I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about the market.

Well, I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about the market. We do not have any banner dayrates to announce today nor have we announced any recently, but that doesn't mean that there's not intense interest in a number of our rigs across a number of markets.
If we just back up for a little bit and put this in perspective on where the market is now versus where it was a year ago, we're seeing a very strong market. We're seeing that the continuation of oil prices at or above $100 for that time period is obviously having, in our judgment, an impact on our customer as they take this oil price in and become increasingly comfortable that, that is the go-forward price that they can count on. 
We've had the North Sea firm up a year ago. We had very little forward visibility. We're concerned about working rigs through the winter, and now we've got backlog in place. We're returning the Guardian from the Falkland Islands to that market for a term contract. 
And in addition to that, Mexico has really come on very strong. We currently have 4 jack-ups and a semi in that market. A year ago, we had 2 jack-ups there, with less than a year of forward visibility. And now we're right at 10 years of commitment spread across those 5 rigs. So Mexico stepping forward, taking up jack-ups, bringing in floaters, is certainly also a real net positive we believe. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to take rigs out of that market, so we're now down to one jack-up and one semi, the Ocean Victory. We've got good demand for both units. We're seeing in the jack-up front that there's a number of small players that are seeking to find well places, oil plays, among other things to put jack-ups to work. And then really with just our sole semi and the 3 of 6,000-foot market, with very little competition, we're seeing great interest in that particular unit as well. 
Over in Indonesia, where we have had a presence since the early '80s, we were down to our core jack-up over there. The Ocean Sovereign has since been cold stacked, and we had the Ocean Rover working in that market for a short-term period. But since then, we've committed the Ocean Monarch for a full year program, so we're glad to continue in that area. And I think that also shows just that you've got lots of interest around the world in areas that people believe that they can develop lots of production that will be profitable at these type of dayrates.
And then the most recent activity that we've gotten is the announcement of the construction of the Ocean Onyx. That has begun in Brownsville, and we're targeting a mid '13 delivery on that unit. So the quick turnaround is certainly an advantage to us as is the low capital cost of approximately $300 million, and we've got interest in that unit already. We're not ready to comment particularly on where that market is. But I think if you watch the Ocean Victory, which is a similar rig, the Onyx will have more capability for sure, but they will service similar market. And as you see what sort of commitments we may have on Ocean Victory going forward, I think that will give you a good clue on where the demand might be for the Ocean Onyx, certainly, in the.Gulf of Mexico. And of course, there was new interest in it in other Atlantic Basin areas that we could put the vessel to work.
Following the Ocean Onyx, we have one more opportunity to do a similar development where we could deliver new capacity to the fourth-generation market. And we're pursuing that from an engineering standpoint at this point and don't have anything else to announce on that.
And then finally, over the past year, we did commit the Ocean BlackHawk and BlackHornet to Anadarko, and we have one more rig in that class to be marked. There's a lot of rigs at that delivery point, so I wouldn't necessarily look at this moment that we're going to have a commitment for it. But as we look forward to demand, we're very comfortable that virtually all of the rigs that are being constructed in that time frame will be committed. And of course, the Ocean BlackRhino, we think that's the coolest name in the whole oil field, and we hope that our customers will think the same thing.
So with the -- that is sort of my commentary on the market. Gary Krenek will be talking about cost guidance, but let me comment a little bit on that. Obviously for the quarter, we were mostly impacted by a very favorable change in our tax rate, and Gary will talk about that. But from our operational standpoint, I'm pleased with our execution. We had 146 days of unanticipated equipment downtime, which is up from an average of about 85 a quarter for the first 3 quarters of the year, but well within our target operational envelope. And so we're pleased with that.
We had 570 days of shipyard on mobe time. And of course, that we try to provide guidance so that you know that, that's coming, and that was up from what we've been experiencing during the year. We've got a number of surveys on a go-forward basis, but we think that, that's a large number. And we believe that, that will come down.
Our OpEx was also within guidance, I believe. Recently, Gary had indicated to you that our total OpEx would be right at $1.5 billion for the entire year, and we came in at $1.550 billion, which we'll declare victory on that, that we were comfortable going forward.
So really the story at Diamond Offshore, we'll be watching the market in the coming year, in the coming quarters to see what sort of commitments we have there. And then we will continue to work very hard to execute, to deliver on the dayrates that we have, both from a downtime standpoint from an operating cost.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary and let him elaborate on some of the numbers that you saw for the quarter."

I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter, and then we'll go into some detail as to what we expect to see in the coming year in 2012.For the quarter just ended, we had net income of $188 million or $1.36 per share, this coming",1925,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter, and then we'll go into some detail as to what we expect to see in the coming year in 2012.
For the quarter just ended, we had net income of $188 million or $1.36 per share, this coming on contract drilling revenues of $734 million. As Larry said, the -- our downtime for planned regulatory surveys and shipyard downtime was up in the fourth quarter, just as we had forecasted it would be, and that impacted our revenues and of course, then impacted the bottom line. But a total of 5 rigs in the shipyard in the fourth quarter had missed all or most of the quarter and were off dayrate. 
We also had an additional 4 rigs that we're mobing to various areas in the world, mobing 2 contracts, and that affected us in the fourth quarter. Again, all of these came in about at the amount of time that we had forecast and have released on our rig status reports earlier. The big thing that impacted positively the quarter was the tax rate, and I'm going to talk about that in just a second. 
Looking -- getting a little bit more specific on some of the line items in the income statement for Q4. Contract drilling expenses, we guided in our last conference call and said that they will come in between $410 million to $420 million. That actually came in at $407 million, so just slightly under our guidance. As Larry said, cost control is a top priority here at Diamond Offshore, and we continue to follow through on that and provide numbers set within our guidance or slightly below.
G&A and interest expense came in close to what we had indicated in our last conference call. Depreciation expense was slightly below our expectations, and this was due to a normal year-end adjustment. We booked our depreciation through the year and have to true it up at the end of the year. We ultimately underspent our capital by about $25 million in 2011, and this gave rise to the fourth quarter adjustment that we had. It was about $6 million. So other than that, we would have come in within the guidance of the depreciation.
The big thing, of course, in the quarter was the tax -- effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the fourth -- for the year was 18.4%. We had expected it to come in at somewhere between 21% and 24%, and there's a couple of reasons for the lower rate. But first of all, in the fourth quarter, we had reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, for your accounting and tax type, such as FIN 48 accrual. We have some time-sensitive issues in that accrual that turned in December -- actually, at the end of December and as a result, caused us to book some credits to our tax expense as these items expired. They were items that we could anticipate but for GAAP reasons, could not recognize until the timing actually expired on these items. And therefore, it drove our tax expense for the quarter down.
We also had our normal year-end true up, domestic versus foreign earnings and also where we're earning those foreign earnings at. We do report tax rate every quarter in accordance with GAAP. Whether you're still always working with estimates, we, finally, in the fourth quarter, get to work with actual numbers and that caused the rate to change a little bit.
So the -- our rate actually was down a couple of percentage points lower for the year than what we had anticipated. But because we had to book that accumulative adjustment in the fourth quarter, it caused the Q4 tax rate to be 7.5%. And I'll talk about the next year's tax rate in a second. 
As Larry said, we had forecasted our rig operating expense or contract drilling expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. We did that in our fourth quarter conference call a year ago. They came in at $1.550 billion. And so as he said, we'll declare victory there and think we did a pretty good job. 
Looking forward to 2012, we're forecasting those same contract drilling expenses to increase by about $100 million and be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.650 billion. The increase is due to a couple of things. First of all, we are anticipating doing 12 special surveys this year, 11 floater rigs and one jack-up. This will also, of course, have an impact on down days in our revenues. And rather than going through the detail there, I'd point you to our rig status report that we issued yesterday evening, or we also have on our website to see the timing of those surveys and the actual number of the down days expected with all of them. We also have -- are seeing some increases in labor cost in the industry, along with training costs, as we gear up for additional rigs coming into our fleet. These 2 items will make up the bulk of the remaining increase in cost '11 over '12. 
There is some general inflation that we're seeing in the industry. However, that will for the most part, we believe, be offset by the fact that we cold stacked a couple of rigs in 2011. We incurred the cost in '11 for those rigs. We won't incur it in '12. And so that savings will, we believe, offset the general inflation. Again, contract drilling expenses will be about $1.650 billion for 2012. 
Just a little bit more color on that. During the year, we expect to see normal rig operating costs, as we always do, plus the survey costs for the 12 rigs that we'll have coming into survey. Those survey costs, we believe, will run us, in addition to their normal cost, about $5 million to $7 million additional above operating cost for each of the rigs, with the exception being the worker in the Star. But we think those costs will be $8 million to $10 million above the operating -- normal operating cost. And conversely, the Guardian and the King, we think, will be somewhere in the $3 million to $5 million range with the surveying and repair-type cost.
Mobe and amortized mobilization cost for 2012, we believe, will come in somewhere around $90 million. First quarter, we will incur about $45 million of that $90 million. The remaining Q2 through Q4 will be somewhere in the $14 million to $16 million range. Q1 will be high for 2 reasons: Number one, in 2011, we mobed the Ocean Monarch from the Gulf of Mexico to Southeast Asia. The initial work on that rig when we got there was a 4-month job. We have since signed that up, and that rig is committed for an additional 4 years. But because of accounting rules, we are having to amortize that mobe over just the initial 4-months job. The rig got to Southeast Asia in December, so we recorded a little bit of that in the fourth quarter this year. But we'll write the rest of that mobe off in the first quarter.
Also, we have the Guardian that is mobing from the Falkland Islands to the North Sea. It will do its survey in the North Sea and then go work for a 2-year commitment with Shell. But again, accounting rules, because we're going to a survey, requires us to expense that mobe currently rather than amortizing it over the length of the contract. So we'll see $45 million in Q1 for that.
Again, I would remind everyone that these amortized mobe cost for the most part are offset by amortized mobe revenues that we've received. As always, I remind everyone that I've been talking about the line in our income statement, contract drilling expenses only. But these numbers do not include cost incurred in the line, reimbursable expenses. We give no guidance for reimbursable expenses nor do we give guidance for reimbursable revenues. If you look at that, they almost always net to a very immaterial amount. So that was $1.650 million contract drilling expenses only. 
Looking at just the first quarter of 2012 for contract drilling expenses, we believe Q1 will come in somewhere in the $405 million to $420 million range. This will be comprised of the normal rig operating cost; the Baroness survey cost, the Baroness, we'll do in Q1; and then the mobe cost that I talked about earlier. 
Other line items in 2012. G&A, we believe, will be flat with the prior year. It'd be somewhere in the $17 million to $18 million range each quarter. Depreciation goes up slightly due to capital expenditures and will be in the $105 million to $108 million range per quarter. And interest expense, our gross interest on our debt is $22 million per quarter. We will be capitalizing a portion of that during the year. We estimate right now approximately $8 million per quarter, which will give us a net interest expense on the P&L statement of approximately $14 million.
Looking at the tax rate for 2012. We are right now estimating net tax rate to be somewhere in the 27% to 29% range, so a pretty significant increase over 2011. There are a number of reasons for that. First of all, expiration of the tax extenders bill, which expired on December 31 of this past year. This law included the provision that allowed the company to defer, recognizing certain foreign earnings as U.S. taxable income, until such earnings are repatriated back to the U.S. With the expiration of this law, certain foreign incomes will now be taxed currently in the U.S, thus increasing our effective tax rate for the year.
Secondly, for the past 15 years, we've recorded a tax deduction or amortization associated with our acquisition of Arethusa drilling back in 1995. Those deductions were fully amortized last year and thus, we don't have benefit of those deductions in 2012 or any time thereafter.
Third, as I said earlier, we had a fourth quarter reduction of our FIN 48 accrual. This reduced our overall tax rate for 2011, and we're not able to forecast any similar reduction to -- for 2012. So we're not going to see a credit for that, we don't believe, at this time in 2012. And finally, the normal mixture between domestic and foreign earnings always has an effect on our tax rate. We've put that into our model, wash it through. And as a result, take all of these things in account, we now expect a 27% to 29% tax rate. We'll, of course, be updating that quarterly as the year progresses.
And finally, capital expenditures for the coming year, we believe we'll see maintenance capital of $330 million. Our guidance last year was $300 million. We came in at about $275 million, so we had some rollover into 2012. So when you take that into account, maintenance capital is about flat year-over-year. And then we also expect to record about $220 million of capital for our new build rigs, primarily the Onyx, but we'll also see some capitalized cost for oversight of the drill ships and of course, the capitalized interest on the drill ships. So in total, we expect to see $550 million of CapEx for the year. Approximately $100 million of that will be spent, we believe, in Q1. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

How do you kind of decipher between who's paying for the downtime, if you have to pull a BOP and all the new regulatory issues? Could you maybe talk to a little bit to that? And I think it's been kind of handed to me that a lot of it has to do with how the manufacturers recommend the kind of maintenance cycle on a BOP, and so it needs to get rewritten into the contracts as unpaid or paid downtime. And how does the new contracts compare to the older legacy contracts that we're currently working off right now? Long-winded question, but hopefully, you got that."

And of course, that's quite a bit different from where we are today. We've seen over the past 5 or 6 years just a change in operations in that. It used to be that it would take more time to move from one location to set up another well, and you would have a normal 2 or 3 days built-in, where you could perform your maintenance on the BOP stack. And now at these dayrates, as you can imagine, our customers are intensely focused on trying to reduce nonproductive time. So we actually lose ground over time, and that they maybe ready to go. And so we don't get as much downtime. And we're pushing wherever we can to expand that, but that's an ongoing process. There's other issues as well on the contracts. Michael, do you have any things you've noted?"

As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things. One, on a current basis, we're very pleased",986,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things. One, on a current basis, we're very pleased with our performance on rigs avoiding downtime. There's always going to be some sort of downtime. We had quarters in the past year where we just absolutely had minimal in terms of just a few days of downtime, and that's anomaly enough something can be repeated. But the amount of times where we had rigs that where all contracts were well within what our expectations are, given the high standards that everybody looks forward these days. And so that obviously impacted our results. We were pleased with our cost as well. We ran a rigid budget system and tried to control costs, whereas at the same time we're making sure that our vessels are maintained and are in proper working order.  Don't view those as trade offs, we think you can achieve both, you stay on top of your game. And I think some evidence of that as we sold during the quarter or the Ocean Columbia to Hercules and they were very pleased with the condition of that rig, and we're glad to take that over. 
And then secondly, we'll talk about the market and most of our signings that we have for future impact but obviously everybody's following the trends on what's happening with day rates in the current period. In the report that we released just last night, not sure that we had anything all that significant we've announced that we have a follow-on job for Saratoga when it completes its well down at Guyana  with CGX that we have one well a prospect down in the Gulf and we got interest from several other customers for follow-on work. There's really no other vessel in that class currently in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's limited in water depth to around 2,000 feet, but there's still a great number of prospects and work overwork in various projects that could utilize that rig on a go-forward basis. So we're pleased to bring that back to the Gulf of Mexico, which will affect -- double our U.S. fleet because with the sale of Columbia, we're now down to just one in the Ocean Victory. 
We announced a future commitment on the Ocean Victory not in this fleet status report, but one earlier in the month. We took a year commitment on that rig and traced just a hair under $420,000 a day. The vessel previous to that and is currently working on a 3.25 rate, and of course the dates that one commitment was made versus another us going is lined up, but still almost $100,000 jump well to well certainly indicates again the few rigs that are in that class, that can service the 4,000- to 5000-foot market on a mobe basis shows that there's great demand for that. So that rig will be available in 2013 and then shortly after our pricing one of our competitors now announced a similar rig, similar capacity rig in the Gulf of Mexico at an even higher rate. So again, this reflects the few number of rigs, which I think is somewhat related to the Macondo events as we and others took a number of rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico, pursue opportunities around the world, there are just actually a few of those rigs left here in the Gulf of Mexico. And so with more buyers than you have sellers in there then it is natural that those rates have risen and continue to rise. Now we're going to be able to service that market potentially in the Gulf of Mexico in addition with the Victory with the Ocean Onyx rig, which is currently in Brownsville, not due out till the middle of next summer, but our expectations are that in the market similar to this that we'll be able to take some of the interest, we had quite a bit of interest in that vessel and turn that into a commitment in advance of that.
I think around the Rest of the World, we haven't really had anything that's all that significant. We signed a commitment to take a rig, a jack-up currently operating in Egypt, the Ocean Spur, down to Ecuador and bareboat that vessel at a $30,000 a day charter fee, which we're pleased to do that. We drilled off Ecuador previously and we had to take a rig out of Indonesia to service that. And it just shows you that there are no rigs, no available jack-up rigs on the West Coast of North and South America that you got to go that far to get a vessel. That still reflects that the jack-ups, there are good prospects for those. There continues to be interest in some of our older rigs in reselling those and we will pursue those opportunities, our opportunities such as we had in Mexico, where we've been able to put rigs to work. 
So I think that's the general survey of what's going on. We also have the Ocean BlackRhino, which again has a delivery date in mid-'14. So we wouldn't really expect to turn that into a job under normal circumstances a little bit further down the road. And we're certainly very comfortable of that as we survey the demand for those class of vessels, particularly in West Africa, but around the world, we think that demand is very strong and BlackRhino like its sister rigs, the BlackHawk and the BlackHornet, we'll be able to find a significant term commitment before it's delivered. So with that, I'm going to let Gary Krenek give you some more details on our cost and other financial matters that happened during the quarter. Gary?"

For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quart",934,"Thanks, Larry. For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quarter coming in at $185 million of net income and earnings per share of $1.33 as opposed to $1.36 last quarter. Even though things were fairly similar, there are a couple of items in our income statement that bear note that were different. One was as Larry said we have the sale of Ocean Columbia this past quarter. We recorded a gain of approximately $16 million after tax or $0.12 a share, which increased earnings in the quarter. That was offset by a higher tax rate in Q1 and Q4. The Q1 tax rate came in at about 26.5%, just slightly below our guidance as opposed to last quarter's tax rate, which was 7.5%. And if you recall from our last conversation last quarter that 7.5% was an abnormal due to several year end tax adjustments and accounting adjustments that were required for us to make. 
Looking at some of the specific line items in income statement, contract drilling expense particularly, we guided to $405 to  $420 million last quarter and we came in at $397 million. Two reasons for this. One, we do have a little bit of cost that have been shifted from Q1 to Q2 survey that we had expected to do in Q1 has been shifted into Q2. And so that will drive a little bit of the cost in the second quarter. But the main reason is exactly what Larry said, continued company worldwide effort to control costs and keep things within our budgets. And again I'm happy to report we did a very good job on that in the first quarter. 
G&A and interest expense both came in close to where we expected. Depreciation did come in a little bit lower than what we expected at $101.4 million, and we will be adjusting our expectations for the rest of the year on depreciation, I'll give that out in just a second. And as I said, our tax rate came in just a hair under what we expected also.
Looking forward to the second quarter, one of the main drivers of the results in our next quarter will be some of the survey time we have on a number of our rigs. We're anticipating right now 6 rigs will be in the shipyard for survey during Q2, 5 semisubmersibles and 1 of our jack-ups. These are all scheduled surveys and things that we released earlier, letting people know that these rigs would be down in 2012. I'll point you to the rig status report that we received last night for individual rig names and the number of days and when these things are going to occur. But that will affect our results in Q2. 
Also, 2 of our mid-water rigs will be mobing back to the Gulf of Mexico this quarter, both the Saratoga that Larry spoke about and the Whittington. So both of those modes we will expense the entire mobe in Q2 in accordance with GAAP as opposed to having and amortized over a longer period of time. So both of the surveys and the mobes will affect both revenue and our cost lines in Q2. 
Getting down to specifics contract drilling expenses again will incur a normal operating cost, which we released by rig type and region last quarter. Those will be incurred. In addition to 6 rigs in the shipyard during the surveys, each of those surveys will run anywhere between $3 million and $10 million each, and combined we're expecting an additional cost of anywhere between $35 million to $40 million because of those surveys.
The cost to mobe the Saratoga and the Whittington will add another $10 million to $12 million to our cost results. And in addition, the normal amortization of old mobes that we had every quarter will add another $17 million, that's $17 million of amortized mobe, for the most part is offset by amortized mobe revenues also. So if you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expenses to be somewhere between $415 million to $430 million in Q2. As always, I remind you that is for the line contract drilling expenses only, reimbursable costs will be in addition to that amount.
G&A, similar to going forward, $17 million, $18 million just as we saw the first quarter. Appreciation will come down a little bit on that. We are now expecting depreciation between $100 million to $103 million in Q2 and Q3. And more likely than not in Q4 also, but we will continue to monitor whether we have any changes later in the year. 
Interest expense also remains the same. Our gross interest expense is $22 million per quarter. We expect to capitalize about $7 million of that in the second quarter for a net interest expense on our income statement of $15 million. 
Effective tax rate, just a slight change. We now expect that rate to be somewhere between 26% and 29% for the remainder of 2012. And finally, capital expenditures, no change from prior guidance. We expect $330 million of maintenance capital for the year, and we also expect to spend about $220 million for our new builds. A small portion of that, the oversight of the drill ships in Korea, but the bulk of the $220 million will be the Ocean Onyx being built down in Brownsville. And with that, I would like to Larry."

They are going to give it a good go there and intelligent people. But I think that will not transform overnight. And when you look at the size of their geological prospects, that's the drilling on, it's going to require active, high efficiency rigs going at it now. If you wait the period of time that it's going to take to deliver all of these rigs and get it started, I mean, you take a significant cash flow from increased production and get it down the road 7 to 10 years. So if you do all the math on that, I think in the foreseeable future that the U.S. guys are not necessarily going to be squeezed out, whether or not Brazil builds rigs locally or continues to contract from the outside."

I guess one big difference is in the '04, '05 cycle when we kicked off, rigs were idle rigs and had much lower day rates. The valley between that last period of the appropriate returns for drilling contractors and today is -- was really not that bad. You had the financial crisis impact things and all that. I mean but we rolled in to this with many rigs working at substantial rates of return and substantial income. So the moves, I think, have not been as dramatic on a percentage basis. And when you're coming off a place where fourth-generation rigs were going into the cycle at 70 or 80 and ultimately finish at 5 to 600, there was a huge room to move and here you're coming off rigs that were in the 300s for that class of rig, maybe 200 in some case. And we are headed now into the 400s. So but again, each time we never as in '04, if you ask me, I mean I wouldn't have predicted that we would ended up through that cycle with rigs in upper 500 and 600s for the fourth-generation rigs. So I'm hesitant to say what the cap is in going to be in this cycle.

338612,183391922,285656,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things: one, on a current basis, we're very pleased",1001,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things: one, on a current basis, we're very pleased with the -- our performance on rigs avoiding downtime. There's always going to be some sort of downtime. We had quarters in the past year where we just absolutely had minimal in terms of just a few days of downtime, and that's anomaly enough, something that can be repeated. But the amount of times where we had rigs that were off contract were well within what our expectations are, given the high standards that everybody looks forward these days. And so that obviously impacted our results. 
We were pleased with our cost as well. We run a rigid budget system and tried to control costs, whereas at the same time, we're making sure that our vessels are maintained and are in proper working order. We don't view those as trade-offs. We think you can achieve both if you stay on top of your game. And I think some evidence of that, as we sold during the quarter, the Ocean Columbia to Hercules, and they were very pleased with the condition of that rig. And we're glad to take that over. 
And then secondly, we'll talk about the market, and most of our signings that we have are for future impact, but obviously, everybody's following the trends on what's happening with day rates in the current period. In the fleet status report that we released just last night, not sure that we had anything all that significant. 
We've announced that we have a follow-on job for the Saratoga when it completes its well down at Guyana with CGX, that we have one well, a prospect back in the Gulf, and we've got interest from several other customers for follow-on work. There's really no other vessel in that class, currently, in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's limited in water depth to around 2,000 feet. But there's still a great number of prospects and work-over-work in various projects that could utilize that rig on a go-forward basis. So we're pleased to bring that back to the Gulf of Mexico, which will, in effect, double our U.S. fleet. Because with the sale of Columbia, we're now down to just one, the Ocean Victory. 
We announced a future commitment on the Ocean Victory, not in this fleet status report, but one earlier in the month. We took 1 year of commitment on that rig and priced just a hair under $420,000 a day. The vessel previous to that and is currently working on a 3.25 rate. And of course, the dates that one commitment was made versus another don't always line up. But still, almost a $100,000 jump well-to-well, certainly indicates, again, the few rigs that are in that class, that can service the 4,000- to 5,000-foot market on a mobe [ph] basis, shows that there's great demand for that. So that rig will be available in 2013. And then shortly after our pricing, one of our competitors now announced a similar rig -- similar capacity rig in the Gulf of Mexico at an even higher rate. 
So again, this reflects the few number of rigs, which I think is somewhat related to the Macondo events. As we and others took a number of rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico pursue opportunities around the world, there are just actually a very few of those rigs left here in the Gulf of Mexico. 
And so with more buyers than you have sellers in there, then it's natural that those rates have risen and continue to rise. Now we're going to be able to service that market potentially in the Gulf of Mexico in addition with the Victory, with the Ocean Onyx rig, which is currently in Brownsville, not due out until the middle of next summer. But our expectations are, that in the market similar to this, that we'll be able to take some of the interest. And we've had quite a bit of interest in that vessel and turned that into a commitment in advance of that.
I think around the rest of the world, we haven't really had anything that's all that significant. We signed a commitment to take a rig, a jack-up currently operating in Egypt, the Ocean Spur, down to Ecuador and bareboat that vessel at a $30,000-a-day charter fee, which we're pleased to do that. We drilled off Ecuador previously, and we had to take the rig out of Indonesia to service that. And it just shows you that there are no rigs, no available jack-up rigs on the West Coast of North and South America that you got to go that far to get a vessel. 
But that sort of reflects that the jack-ups, there are good prospects for those. There continues to be interest in some of our older rigs in reselling those. And we are -- we will pursue those opportunities or opportunities such as we've had in Mexico, where we've been able to put rigs to work. 
So I think that's the general survey of what's going on. We also have the Ocean BlackRhino, which again, has a delivery date in mid-'14. So we wouldn't really expect to be able to turn that into a job under normal circumstances to a little bit further down the road. And we're certainly very comfortable with that as we survey the demand for those class of vessels, particularly in West Africa. But around the world, we think that demand is very strong. And the BlackRhino, like its sister rigs, the BlackHawk and the BlackHornet, will be able to find a significant term commitment before it's delivered. 
So with that, I'm going to let Gary Krenek give you some more details on our cost and other financial matters that happened during the quarter. Gary?"
338612,183391922,285656,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quart",944,"Thanks, Larry. For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quarter coming in at $185 million of net income and earnings per share of $1.33, as opposed to $1.36 last quarter. 
So even though things were fairly similar, there were a couple of items in our income statement that bear -- that were different. One was, as Larry said, we have the sale of Ocean Columbia this past quarter. We recorded a gain of approximately $16 million after-tax or $0.12 a share, which increased earnings in the quarter. That was offset by a higher tax rate in Q1 than Q4. The Q1 tax rate came in at about 26.5%, just slightly below our guidance, as opposed to last quarter's tax rate, which was 7.5%. And if you recall from our last conversation last quarter, that 7.5% was abnormal due to several year-end tax adjustments and accounting adjustments that were required for us to make. 
Looking at some of the specific line items in the income statement, contract drilling expense particularly, we guided to $405 million to $420 million last quarter, and we came in at $397 million. Two reasons for this. One, we did have a little bit of cost that have been shifted from Q1 to Q2. They're in a survey that we expected to do in Q1 has been shifted into Q2. And so that will drive a little bit of the cost in the second quarter. 
But the main reason was exactly what Larry said, continued company worldwide effort to control costs and keep things within our budgets. And again, I'm happy to report, we did a very good job on that in the first quarter. 
G&A and interest expense both came in close to where we expected. Depreciation did come in a little bit lower than what we expected at $101.4 million. And we will be adjusting our expectations for the rest of the year on depreciation. I'll give that out in just a second. And as I said, our tax rate came in just a hair under what we had expected also.
Looking forward to the second quarter, one of the main drivers of the results in our next quarter will be some of the survey time we have on a number of our rigs. We're anticipating right now: 6 rigs will be in the shipyard for survey during Q2, 5 semisubmersibles and 1 of our jack-ups. These are all scheduled surveys and things that we released earlier, letting people know that these rigs would be down in 2012. 
I would point you to the rig status report that we received last night for individual rig names and the number of days and when these things are going to occur. But that will affect our results in Q2. 
Also, 2 of our mid-water rigs will be mobing back to the Gulf of Mexico this quarter, both the Saratoga that Larry spoke about and the Whittington. So both of those mobes, we will expense the entire mobe in Q2 in accordance with GAAP, as opposed to having them amortized over a longer period of time. So both of these, the surveys and the mobes, will affect both revenue and our cost lines in Q2. 
Getting down to specifics. Contract drilling expenses, again, will incur a normal operating cost, which we released by rig type and region last quarter. Those will be incurred. In addition to 6 rigs in the shipyard doing the surveys, each of those surveys will run anywhere between $3 million and $10 million each. And combined, we're expecting an additional cost of anywhere between $35 million to $40 million because of those surveys.
The cost to mobe the Saratoga and the Whittington back will add another $10 million to $12 million to our cost results. And in addition, the normal amortization of old mobes that we have every quarter will add another $17 million. That's $17 million of amortized mobe, for the most part is offset by amortized mobe revenues also. So if you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expenses to be somewhere between $415 million to $430 million in Q2. As always, I remind you that is for the line contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to that amount.
G&A, similar to going forward, $17 million, $18 million, just as we saw in the first quarter. Depreciation, as I said, we've come down a little bit on that. We're now expecting depreciation between $100 million to $103 million in Q2 and Q3, and more likely than not, in Q4 also. But we will continue to monitor whether we have any changes later in the year. 
Interest expense also remains the same. Our gross interest expense is $22 million per quarter. We expect to capitalize about $7 million of that in the second quarter for a net interest expense on our income statement of $15 million. 
Effective tax rate, just a slight change. We now expect that rate to be somewhere between 26% and 29% for the remainder of 2012. 
And finally, capital expenditures, no change from prior guidance. We expect $330 million of maintenance capital for the year, and we also expect to spend about $220 million for our new builds. A small portion of that, the oversight of the drill ships in Korea, but the bulk of the $220 million will be the Ocean Onyx being built down in Brownsville.

A couple of years ago, we would have said, ""Okay we know the condition of our rigs."" As they get older, we have to spend a little bit more money. We understand that. We could project that. But as we stand today, there are increasing variables. To take an obvious example, BOP. Our maintenance procedure's BOP inspection procedures that are being promulgated by various regulatory agencies, and they also impact other things on [indiscernible].

I guess one big difference is in the '04, '05 cycle when that kicked off, rigs were -- it'd mean more idle rigs and you had much lower day rates. The valley between that last period of appropriate returns for drilling contractors and today is -- was really not that bad. You had the financial crisis impact things and all that. I mean, but we rolled into this with many rigs working at substantial rates of return and substantial income. So the moves, I think, had not been as dramatic on a percentage basis. And when you're coming off a place where fourth-generation rigs were going into the cycle at 70 or 80 and ultimately finish at 5 to 600, there was a huge room to move. And here you're coming off rigs that were in the 300s for that class of rig, maybe 200s in some case. And we're headed now into the 400s. So but again, each time, we never -- as in '04, if you ask me, I mean I wouldn't have predicted that we would end it up through that cycle with rigs in the upper 500s and 600s for the fourth-generation rigs. So I'm hesitant to say what the cap is going to be in this cycle."

338612,183391922,285863,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things: one, on a current basis, we're very pleased",1002,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. As noted in the press release, we were very pleased with our results for the first quarter, really is a factor of 2 things: one, on a current basis, we're very pleased with the -- our performance on rigs avoiding downtime. There's always going to be some sort of downtime. We’ve had quarters in the past year where we just absolutely had minimal in terms of just a few days of downtime, and that's an anomaly and something that can be repeated. But the amount of times where we had rigs that were off contract were well within what our expectations are, given the high standards that everybody looks forward these days. And so that obviously impacted our results. 
We were pleased with our cost as well. We run a rigid budget system and tried to control costs, whereas at the same time, we're making sure that our vessels are maintained and are in proper working order. We don't view those as trade-offs. We think you can achieve both if you stay on top of your game. And I think some evidence of that is we sold, during the quarter, the Ocean Columbia to Hercules, and they were very pleased with the condition of that rig. And we're glad to take that over. 
And then secondly, we'll talk about the market, and most of our signings that we have are for future impact, but obviously, everybody's following the trends on what's happening with day rates in the current period. In the fleet status report that we released just last night, not sure that we had anything all that significant. 
We've announced that we have a follow-on job for the Saratoga when it completes its well down in Guyana with CGX, that we have one well, a prospect back in the Gulf, and we've got interest from several other customers for follow-on work. There's really no other vessel in that class, currently, in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's limited in water depth to probably around 2,000 feet. But there's still a great number of prospects and work-over-work in various projects that could utilize that rig on a go-forward basis. So we're pleased to bring that back to the Gulf of Mexico, which will, in effect, double our U.S. fleet, because with the sale of Columbia, we're now down to just one, the Ocean Victory. 
We announced a future commitment on the Ocean Victory, not in this fleet status report, but one earlier in the month. We took 1 year of commitment on that rig and priced just a hair under $420,000 a day. The vessel previous to that and is currently working on a 3.25 rate. And of course, the dates that one commitment was made versus another don't always line up. But still, almost a $100,000 jump well-to-well, certainly indicates, again, the few rigs that are in that class that can service the 4,000- to 5,000-foot market on a mobed [ph] basis, shows that there's great demand for that. So that rig will be available in 2013. And then shortly after our pricing, one of our competitors now announced a similar rig -- similar capacity rig in the Gulf of Mexico at an even higher rate. 
So again, this reflects the few number of rigs, which I think is somewhat related to the Macondo events. As we and others took a number of rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico pursue opportunities around the world, there are just actually very few of those rigs left here in the Gulf of Mexico. And so with more buyers than you have sellers in there, then it's natural that those rates have risen and continue to rise. Now we're going to be able to service that market potentially in the Gulf of Mexico in addition with the Victory, with the Ocean Onyx rig, which is currently in Brownsville, not due out until the middle of next summer. But our expectations are, that in the market similar to this, that we'll be able to take some of the interest, and we've had quite a bit of interest in that vessel, and turn that into a commitment in advance of that.
I think around the rest of the world, we haven't really had anything that's all that significant. We signed a commitment to take a rig, a jack-up currently operating in Egypt, the Ocean Spur, down to Ecuador and bareboat that vessel at a $30,000-a-day charter fee, which we're pleased to do that. We drilled off Ecuador previously, and we had to take a rig out of Indonesia to service that. And it just shows you that there are no rigs, no available jack-up rigs on the West Coast of North and South America that you got to go that far to get a vessel. 
But that sort of reflects that the jack-ups, there are good prospects for those. There continues to be interest in some of our older rigs in reselling those. And we are -- we will pursue those opportunities or opportunities such as we've had in Mexico, where we've been able to put rigs to work. 
So I think that's the general survey of what's going on. We also have the Ocean BlackRhino, which again, has a delivery date in mid-'14. So we wouldn't really expect to be able to turn that into a job under normal circumstances till a little bit further down the road. And we're certainly very comfortable with that as we survey the demand for those class of vessels, particularly in West Africa. But around the world, we think that demand is very strong. And the BlackRhino, like its sister rigs, the BlackHawk and the BlackHornet, will be able to find a significant term commitment before it's delivered. 
So with that, I'm going to let Gary Krenek give you some more details on our cost and other financial matters that happened during the quarter. Gary?"
338612,183391922,285863,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quart",945,"Thanks, Larry. For the quarter, we had contract drilling revenues of $755 million, which is slightly above the prior quarter when we reported $734 million. Likewise, net income and earnings per share were very similar quarter-over-quarter, with this quarter coming in at $185 million of net income and earnings per share of $1.33, as opposed to $1.36 last quarter. 
So even though things were fairly similar, there were a couple of items in our income statement that bear -- that were different. One was, as Larry said, we had the sale of Ocean Columbia this past quarter. We recorded a gain of approximately $16 million after-tax or $0.12 a share, which increased earnings in the quarter. That was offset by a higher tax rate in Q1 than Q4. The Q1 tax rate came in at about 26.5%, just slightly below our guidance, as opposed to last quarter's tax rate, which was 7.5%. And if you recall from our last conversation last quarter, that 7.5% was abnormal due to several year-end tax adjustments and accounting adjustments that were required for us to make. 
Looking at some of the specific line items in the income statement, contract drilling expense particularly, we guided to $405 million to $420 million last quarter, and we came in at $397 million. Two reasons for this. One, we did have a little bit of cost that have been shifted from Q1 to Q2. They're in a survey that we expected to do in Q1 has been shifted into Q2. And so that will drive a little bit of the cost in the second quarter. But the main reason was exactly what Larry said, continued company worldwide effort to control costs and keep things within our budgets. And again, I'm happy to report, we did a very good job on that in the first quarter. 
G&A and interest expense both came in close to where we expected. Depreciation did come in a little bit lower than what we expected at $101.4 million. And we will be adjusting our expectations for the rest of the year on depreciation. I'll give that out in just a second. And as I said, our tax rate came in just a hair under what we had expected also.
Looking forward to the second quarter, one of the main drivers of the results in our next quarter will be some of the survey time we have on a number of our rigs. We're anticipating right now: 6 rigs will be in the shipyard for survey during Q2, 5 semisubmersibles and 1 of our jack-ups. These are all scheduled surveys and things that we released earlier, letting people know that these rigs would be down in 2012. I would point you to the rig status report that we received last night for individual rig names and the number of days and when these things are going to occur. But that will affect our results in Q2. 
Also, 2 of our mid-water rigs will be mobing back to the Gulf of Mexico this quarter, both the Saratoga that Larry spoke about and the Whittington. So both of those mobes, we will expense the entire mobe in Q2 in accordance with GAAP, as opposed to having it amortized over a longer period of time. So both of these, the surveys and the mobes, will affect both revenue and our cost lines in Q2. 
Getting down to specifics. Contract drilling expenses, again, will incur a normal operating cost, which we released by rig type and region last quarter. Those will be incurred. In addition, the 6 rigs in the shipyard doing the surveys, each of those surveys will run anywhere between $3 million and $10 million each. And combined, we're expecting an additional cost of anywhere between $35 million to $40 million because of those surveys.
The cost to mobe the Saratoga and the Whittington back will add another $10 million to $12 million to our cost results. And in addition, the normal amortization of old mobes that we have every quarter will add another $17 million. That's $17 million of amortized mobe, for the most part is offset by amortized mobe revenues also. So if you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expenses to be somewhere between $415 million to $430 million in Q2. As always, I remind you that is for the line contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to that amount.
G&A, similar to going forward, $17 million, $18 million, just as we saw in the first quarter. Depreciation, as I said, we've come down a little bit on that. We're now expecting depreciation between $100 million to $103 million in Q2 and Q3, and more likely than not, in Q4 also. But we will continue to monitor whether we have any changes later in the year. 
Interest expense also remains the same. Our gross interest expense is $22 million per quarter. We expect to capitalize about $7 million of that in the second quarter for a net interest expense on our income statement of $15 million. 
The effective tax rate, just a slight change. We now expect that rate to be somewhere between 26% and 29% for the remainder of 2012. 
And finally, capital expenditures, no change from prior guidance. We expect $330 million of maintenance capital for the year, and we also expect to spend about $220 million for our new builds. A small portion of that, the oversight of the drill ships in Korea, but the bulk of the $220 million will be the Ocean Onyx being built down in Brownsville. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

But other parts of it, we don't really control. We want to be competitive and we want to compensate our people appropriately. On rig expenditures, under -- this would be a change. A couple of years ago, we would have said, ""Okay we know the condition of our rigs. As they get older, we have to spend a little bit more money. We understand that.” We could project that. But as we stand today, there are increasing variables. To take an obvious example, BOP. Our maintenance procedure's BOP inspection procedures that are being promulgated by various regulatory agencies, and they also impact other things on a rig. So those are costs that are potentially going up. And those regulations, they're not all fully in place yet.

I guess one big difference is in the '04, '05 cycle when that kicked off, rigs were -- it'd mean more idle rigs and you had much lower day rates. The valley between that last period of appropriate returns for drilling contractors and today is -- was really not that bad. You had the financial crisis impact things and all that. I mean, but we rolled into this with many rigs working at substantial rates of return and substantial income. So the moves, I think, have not been as dramatic on a percentage basis. And when you're coming off a place where fourth-generation rigs were going into the cycle at 70 or 80 and ultimately finish at 5 to 600, there was a huge room to move. And here you're coming off rigs that were in the 300s for that class of rig, maybe 200s in some case. And we're headed now into the 400s. So but again, each time, we never -- as in '04, if you ask me, I mean I wouldn't have predicted that we would end it up through that cycle with rigs in the upper 500s and 600s for the fourth-generation rigs. So I'm hesitant to say what the cap is going to be in this cycle."

We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start be making some comments on the operating results and some of our future data. It's obviously foll",1272,"Thank you, and welcome again to everyone for joining us. We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start be making some comments on the operating results and some of our future data. It's obviously followed by Michael who will elaborate more on markets around the world in an opening statement. And then Gary Krenek, our CFO, will make some further commentary on the numbers that are in this quarter and how it may impact us on a go-forward basis.
First on the operations. We're moving the items related to the sale of the jack-up. We still substantially performed above our budget and the average industry consensus. And one thing I'd like to comment on there, we've got lots of initiatives ongoing in place for a long time, and some of those really were present in this quarter, particularly efforts to reduce on planned downtime.
We came in at 60 days of on planned downtime, in other words, things that result from equipment breaking or being taken offline and where rig has to suspend operations during the quarter -- the past 2 quarters and budgetary basis, we have experienced in the 140-day range, and that's what we set as our budget for the year. We have previously performed better than that. We did 110 days, I think, end the last year. And we were in the 60s if you go back several years. But we were very pleased with that.
And that's a reflection of our preventive maintenance program and the amount of spares that we have so that if equipment fails, we're able to very rapidly get that replaced. And I'll just give an example of what happened here right of the beginning until in the quarter, but it's typical. On one of our rigs, during a routine maintenance inspection, one of our employees noted that some ships on compensator big rig appear to have a crack. And I've seen progress of what they looked at. And given the condition with Greece and Sea Sprint and all kind of things on it, it's really a tremendous catch. The rig was able to obviously, again on top of this instead having that catastrophic failure that could have had -- been down for a longer period of time, but could have potential for any injuries. We're able to plan what we're going to do. Our initial plan was it may take 4 days, but due to the competency of our crews and rig team, they were able to execute this change in under 55 hours.
So those are kind of efforts going on all the time out there. If you think about the difference between 140 days downtime and 60 days as downtime, that 80 days of savings, if our average rate were at $300,000, that's $24 million in the quarter or about $0.12 to $0.13 that we would save as a result of that. So we're not always going to be able to achieve that, but we're certainly working to do that.
Additionally, our operating expenses were within or below budget across-the-board. Again, we're planning, making sure that we've got everything maintained, in great shape, gives you the opportunity to deliver those kind of numbers.
Looking beyond that and looking at the contracts that we announced, obviously, the Ocean Onyx, we were very pleased. We worked for some time with Apache, a great customer. We enjoy working for them. The Onyx will be working the Gulf of Mexico, so the work being done on that rig in Brownsville, so we'll be delivered and have a long mobe with off time to get to other markets, so we're pleased with that.
And again, this reflects our faith in the deepwater market and particularly in our solution, which is not always a great solution, but there a number of places where this plays out very well. Recently, we had announced the Ocean Victory, a little bit lesser capacity rig and signed a job in -- so this is a nice follow-on at these rates. And I'll remind everybody that our cost of delivering this kind of capacity on Ocean Onyx is $300 million versus our -- and we're pursuing those projects as well nearer the 650 rate. And we've seen some higher dayrate recently obviously at 90 but spending half of capital to deliver that. And our operating cost were reduced on the Ocean Onyx because of more simplistic design, and it is still able to deliver the capability that's out there.
That's the demand for our customers. And there's very little competition in this space to be able to deliver rigs of this nature. In fact, we only have one more Victory class rig in the Ocean Bounty. It's located in Singapore, and we're in the process of completing engineering so that we may pursue further with a similar project on that Victory rig. And then next, we announced the 3 big contracts in the North Sea. And I think that Michael will be covering a lot of the deepwater market. But I would just say that this is reflected of the very strong market today. I don't know. It wasn't too much long ago  that the North Sea was nearly condemned, and majors are moving out of there. They never -- the future get -- we see this again and again in provinces that become re-energized based upon market conditions but new technologies that come out that enable our customers to make use of quicker ways to bring product onstream. There's a Brent premium right now, has been for some time. And that makes them more -- very close to infrasure. The drilling is not at great depth. You do have weather issues. But beyond that, it's a great area to drill in. And it's a bee a province of Independence. We [indiscernible] our customer on the Ocean Nomad. Our Ocean Princess is working right now. It continues to work for Enquest. But we've seen Shell come forward. Shell is very active and already have the Ocean Guardian on a 2-year contract. And yet, as they look down the road, they'll add a third year on that contract at 250. And the Vanguard, which is in Norway, which started with a 20-month extension, as we noted, and a nice increase. So all of that being said, there's continued opportunities for our customers to explore and bring on production in mid-waters, in the North Sea, both Norway and U.K. And it's a market where there's not a lot of new capacity or any capacity being brought on and where there's barriers to bringing these in. So it's very strong there. And I'll let Michael make further comments on the North Sea and also how it impacts worldwide. Last thing I'll talk about here is sale of jack-ups. We sold the Ocean Sovereign here in the quarter. And on top of the other jack-ups that we saw, we continued to remove some of the older faster capacity jack-ups from our fleet. I would say we have focus is on deepwater units, and we continue to market those rigs to have a core of high-capacity jack-ups that are in Mexico, and we plan to continuing that. But the rest of our rigs, which are right now scattered around the world, jack-ups in 1 or 2 in different markets. We have been actively moving to sell those. And the market is such that we're able to meet those right now. So again, a very pleasing quarter for us. Michael, do you want to expand on the market?"

The ultra-deepwater market remains robust and continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect fairly new contract announcements here in the near term and in the next few months, possibly occupying to 10 rigs in this segment. And with this, we believe now that 2013 is close to being sold-out and expect demand continue to materialize into 2014 looking at the availability of rigs in that timeframe.
An example of this, there are multiple vendors out right now outstanding that could take an additional 5 rigs off the market in 2014, and we continue to see this come on as we go forward and expect more in the near future.
With respect to pricing, the recent announcements that some of our competitors clearly show that the market is now in the high 500s for 3- to 5-year term work. And we don't expect this to change as we go throughout the remainder of this year. Looking at the deepwater segment, it continues to be strong with the Gulf of Mexico and Africa, West Africa leading the demand. The recent Central U.S. Gulf lease sale highlights the increased activity and that we think is coming in to the ultra-deepwater and deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico were sales generated approximately $1.7 billion in winning bids. So it's a bright future we believe for the Gulf.
The rates continue to increase with leading-edge rates in high 400s to low 500s as seen with the rigs and fixtures included the Onyx. And finally, we don't see any new supply coming into this segment, other than that what we've added recently with the Onyx and potentially the other rig Larry mentioned. We continue to see this to be a tight market going forward and look positive where we're going.
Turning to the mid-water. This market is operating really as 2 distinct segments at the moment. You've got the very strong U.K. and Norwegian North Sea market that Larry mentioned. And then you got a steady to slightly increase market in the remaining international segment or geographic regions.
As you can see from the extensions that we've recently announced yesterday, we're taking rigs down at 2015 and the resulting dayrates are continuing to increase. So the U.K. and North Sea and Norway is leading the charge, and we don't see a real visible end to this demand as we have customers continue to require rig time going forward.
In essence, 2013 with the North Sea is sold-out now. And like I said, we continue to have discussions, so we'll see how those developed and what capacity is available for them.
Looking at the Gulf of Mexico and other international locations in the mid-water market. It continues to be a steady and slightly increasing market. We produced -- we continue to see additional demand coming online typically in the 6- to 9-month range with a bit of pricing power as we go forward but a very steady market at the moment.
So one of the things we wanted to address in this call was to look at our mid-water fleet and how we see it going through the regions going forward. Of course, I discussed North Sea where we had 4 units or 25% of our fleet in this very strong market. We have 5 additional units with Petrobras and PEMEX, and they continue to utilize those with contracts out until late 2014 and 2015. Of course, there's been some recently with OGX out of Brazil. I'll speak to the 3 mid-water units currently under contract. The Ambassador is contracted until September 2012. The Ocean Lexington, which is currently contracted until February of 2013. And the Ocean Quest is under contract till the end of 2013.
Based on our conversations with OGX, and we're currently discussing follow-on work for the Ambassador with other customers, assuming the rig will be released in September of this year. We also believe they would release the Lexington at the end of the contract in February 2013 and are already working on follow-on term contract in direct continuation of that.
We are encouraged by both of these discussions, and we'll continue to update you as things develop. Finally, the Quest has approximately 18 months left in its contract, and we're comfortable with the rig's position with OGX there.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. The Saratoga recently finished its contract with Nexen. It's currently awaiting its next contract. We believe the next contract will commence towards the end of the summer and should provide a steady stream of term work into 2013.
In Asia, we announced new contracts on both the Patriot and General. These will be utilized into the first quarter of 2013 and are already seeing other operators line up to secure rig time behind these contracts. So with these rigs utilized or anticipating contracts, as I mentioned, that really only leaves the Ocean Whittington, which is currently undergoing current evaluation to estimate the requirements for that rig to return to work.
So in summary, of our 16 mid-water units in our fleet, 4 exposed to very strong North Sea market and have significant subcontracts; 5 are on long-term contracts with NOCs; and the remaining 6 are finding steady 6- to 9-month jobs with continued exposure to the increased pricing in the market as it improves.
Again, it only leaves the Whittington. And I think so you can see why we're pretty comfortable with our mid-water portfolio position and cash flows that it produces. With that summary of my market, Gary?"

We did that despite contract drilling revenues decreasing from Q1 of $755 million to $726 million in Q2. The decrease in revenues was driven by the fact that we have 5 rigs down for special surveys in Q1 just as we had forecasted in our last conference call and reflected in our rig status report. This is versus only one down in the first quarter. This reduction in revenue was mitigated by the very good unplanned downtime that Larry talked about in his opening statements. And that helped offset amount downtime for the special survey that we have.
As pointed out in the press release, we have 2 significant items outside of revenues that affected our earnings. Again, we have 5 jack-ups that we reported sold during the quarter: the Solberg, the Heritage and 3 of Mac jack-ups. The sale of the jack-ups resulted in about $15.5 million worth of gain or $0.36 per share after-tax.
The gains reported on 2 of these rigs, the Sovereign and the Heritage, which was a vast majority of the total gain of $50 million had no current tax expense associated with them. The result of them being owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries in which profits are indefinitely reinvested, and thus, not subject to the current U.S. taxes. In other words, we had a 0 tax rate on the gains of these rigs.
Which brings us to our second significant item in our income statement, our Q2 tax rate of 18.4%. 18.4% was driven by a couple of items. One, just normal geography changes in our estimated earnings in the year between domestic and international as we always had. Also, the treatment from a tax standpoint of capitalized interest that we recorded on the Ocean Black line which we announced in the second quarter. These 2 had small effects on our tax rate and dropping it slightly. But primarily, the factoring in of the additional $50 million of gain on the Sovereign and the Heritage was 0 tax rate was the main reason that the tax rate was driven down as far as it was.
These 3 items will also affect the ongoing tax rate for the remainder of the year, and I'll talk about that in a second. Looking at some of the specific line items on our income statement in Q2. Contract drilling expense, we have guidance of $415 million and $430 million, and we actually came in at $405 million. Several reasons for this. One, we thought we were going to begin a survey on the Whittington in Q2. We did not do that work. We're still assessing the condition in that rig, as Michael talked about. And we also benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These 2 items would have brought us up close to the low end of our guidance, maybe slightly below. The rest of the favorable variance on our contract drilling expense due, as Larry said, to our cost control on the rigs and also the reduced unplanned downtime. Less unplanned downtime means less broken equipment plus payers. And that benefited us not only on the revenues side but here on the cost side.
Looking at few of other line items. G&A was $18.7 million, which was within our guidance. Depreciation was just slightly below what we guided to and that was driven by the sales of the Sovereign and the impact of spending depreciation on that rig. Interest was lower. We had guided $15 million and actually came in $12.7 million. This again is attributable to capitalized interest on the Ocean deposit. And finally, of course, the tax rate was substantially lower.
Other than gain or sale of asset on the income statement, there was nothing really on the income statement of note. Looking forward to the third quarter, one of the main drivers again will be downtime to the rig surveys. As we've been saying for some time now, both 2012 and 2013 are going to be heavy survey years for us. So this should come as no surprise what we reported in the rig status report.
In the third quarter, we're anticipating that 6 rigs will be down for a survey. 3 of them will begin in their surveys. And 4 others -- 3 others will actually participate in surveys at Q2 and then will complete surveys in the third quarter. In addition, the Ocean Summit or jack-up down in Mexico will be down for about 60 days doing some planned repairs and also some modifications required by PEMEX contract.
A couple of other rigs with scheduled downtime, and again, I refer you to the rig status report for details for exactly what rig and what timing those will occur. This downtime, of course, will affect both revenues and cost in Q3.
I have some of the specifics. Contract drilling expense, we will again incur the normal daily operating cost by rig type and region that we gave out earlier in the year. In addition, the 6 rigs in the shipwork to survey, each survey will run somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of additional cost and land about $25 million to $30 million for our total cost. We will also incur an additional about $12 million of amortized mobe cost. And again, these amortized mobe costs will be offset almost dollar-for-dollar by amortizing mobe revenues.
If you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expense for the third quarter to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million. Again, I remind everybody that this $410 million to $425 million is for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs are not included in the amount I just gave you. If you look at those 2 together, you can just add another $10 million to $15 million worth of reimbursable costs, which will be offset also on almost dollar-for-dollar by reimbursable revenues.
The other line item, G&A remains the same. Guidance, as before, $17 million to $19 million a quarter. Depreciation, slightly lower guidance, down to $99 million to $101 million per quarter both for Q3 and Q4. And interest expense, we now believe up to $22 million worth of gross interest expense will capitalize by $10 million in Q3 and Q4, which will leave us a net of about $11 million worth of expense. This again is an increased or expenses decreased because of the Black line. The effective tax rate we believe will now for Q3 and Q4 be somewhere between 22% and 25%. This reduction from prior guidance is the result of accounting rules, which has used spread of the 0 tax rate that was recorded on the sale of the jack-ups not just in the quarter that occurred but spread that over -- equally over all 4 quarters in the year. So again, 22% to 25% going forward.
And finally, capital expenditures, we now believe maintenance capital will be somewhere in the $320 million range. And our newbuild because of the Black line and Onyx will be somewhere around $400 million for the year ended 2012, which gives us a total of $720 million.
One other item I'd like to mention before turning it back to Larry. For those who may have missed it, during the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to A3. This rate brings us in line with our Standard & Poor's rating of A- that we have for some time now. With this upgrade, Diamond Offshore is now the only offshore contract driller with an A3 or A- rating in our industry, a reflection of our strong balance sheet and strong financial profile. And with that, hand it back to Larry."

We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start by making some comments on the operating results and some of our future dayrates. So I'll be foll",1350,"Thank you, and welcome again to everyone for joining us. We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start by making some comments on the operating results and some of our future dayrates. So I'll be followed by Michael Acuff who will elaborate more on markets around the world in an opening statement. And then Gary Krenek, who's our CFO, will make some further commentary on the numbers that are in this quarter and how those may impact us on a go-forward basis.
First, on the operations, removing the items related to the sale of the jack-ups, we still substantially performed above our budget and the average industry consensus. And one thing I'd like to comment on there, we've got lots of initiatives ongoing that have been in place for a long time and some of those really were, included in this quarter, particularly efforts to reduce unplanned downtime.
We came in at 60 days of unplanned downtime. In other words, things that result from equipment breaking or being taken offline, where the rig has to suspend the operations during the quarter -- the past 2 quarters. And on a budgetary basis, we have experienced in the 140-day range and that's what we set as our budget for the year. We have previously performed better than that. We did a 110 days, I think, at end of last year. And we were in the 60s if you go back several years. But we were very pleased with that. And that's a reflection of our preventive maintenance program and the amount of spares that we have so that if equipment fails, we're able to very rapidly get that replaced.
And I'll just give you an example that's happened here right at the beginning of July. It wasn't in the quarter, but it's typical. On one of our rigs, during a routine maintenance inspection, one of our employees noted that some ships [indiscernible] on compensator on a big rig appeared to have a crack. And I've seen progress of what they've looked at. And given the condition with grease and sea spray and all kind of things on it, it was really a tremendous catch. The rig was able to obviously -- again on top of this, instead of having a catastrophic failure, that could have had -- been down for a longer period of time, but could have potential for injuries. We're able to get -- plan what we're going to do. Our initial plan was it may take 4 days, but due to the competency of our crews and great planning, they were able to execute this change in under 55 hours.
So those are the kind of efforts that are going on all of the time out there. And if you think about the difference between 140 days of downtime and 60 days of downtime, that 80 days of savings, if our average rate were at $300,000, that's $24 million in a quarter or about $0.12 to $0.13 that we would save as a result of that. So we're not always going to be able to achieve that, but we're certainly working hard to do that.
Additionally, our operating expenses were within or below budget across-the-board. Again, we're planning, making sure that we've got everything maintained, in great shape, gives you the opportunity to deliver those kind of numbers.
Moving beyond that and looking at the contracts that we announced, obviously, the Ocean Onyx, we were very pleased. We've worked for some time with Apache in -- a great customer. We enjoy working for them. The Onyx will be working in the Gulf of Mexico. So work is being done on that rig in Brownsville, so that it will be delivered and we will not have a long mobe with off time to get it to mid-water markets. And we're pleased with that.
And again, this reflects our faith in the deepwater market and particularly, in our [indiscernible] solution, which is not always a [indiscernible] solution, but there a number of places where this plays out very well. Recently, we had announced the Ocean Victory, a little bit lesser capacity rig. It signed a job at $420 million. So this is a nice follow-on at these rates.
And I'll remind everybody that our cost of delivering this kind of capacity on Ocean Onyx is $300 million versus our newbuilds, and we're pursuing those projects as well nearer the $650 million rate. And the newbuilds -- we've seen some higher, higher dayrate recently obviously [indiscernible] but there, you're spending half of capital to deliver that. And our operating costs were greatly reduced on the Ocean Onyx because of the more simplistic design, yet it is still able to deliver the capability that's out there.
That's the demand for our customers. And there's very little competition in this space to be able to deliver rigs of this nature. In fact, we only have 1 more Victory-class rig in [indiscernible] the Ocean Bounty. That's located -- cold stacked in Singapore. And we are in the process of completing final engineering so that we may proceed further with a similar project on that particular rig.
And then next, we announced 3 big contracts in the North Sea. And I think Michael will be covering a lot of the deepwater market. But I would just say that this is reflective of an [indiscernible] a very strong market today. I don't know --  it wasn't too much long ago that the North Sea was generally condemned, and majors are moving out of there as those don't have a [indiscernible] future. Yet, we see this again and again in provinces that become re-energized based upon not only market conditions but new technologies that come out that enable our customers to make use of quicker ways to bring product onstream. There's a Brent premium right now. There has been for some time, and that makes them more -- work very well. It's very close to infrastructure. The drilling is not at great depths. You do have weather issues. But beyond that, it's a great area to drill in. And it's been a province of independence. We [indiscernible] Petroleum is our customer on the Ocean Nomad. Our Ocean Princess is working right now. It continues to work for Enquest. But we've seen Shell come forward. Shell is very active and already have the Ocean Guardian on a 2-year contract. And yet, as they look now on the road, they elected to add a third year on that contract to $350 million. And as the Vanguard, which is in Norway with Statoil, we got a 20-month extension, as we noted, and a nice increase.
So all of that being said, there's continued opportunities for our customers to explore and bring on production in mid-waters in the North Sea, both Norway and U.K. And it's a market where there's not a lot of new capacity or any capacity being brought on. It's a market where there's barriers to bringing rigs in. So it's very strong there. And I'll let Michael make any further comments on North Sea and also how that impacts worldwide.
The last thing I'll talk about here is the sale of jack-ups. We sold the Ocean Sovereign here in the quarter. And on top of the other jack-ups that we've sold, we continued to remove some of the older lesser capacity jack-ups from our fleet. I would say we have -- our focus is on ultra-deep, deep and mid-water units. And we continue to market those rigs around the world. We have a core of high-capacity jack-ups that are in Mexico, and we are planning to continue that. But the rest of our rigs, which are right now scattered around the world, jack-ups in 1 or 2 in different markets, we have been actively moving to sell those. And the market is such that we're able to make those right now. So again, a very pleasing quarter for us.
Michael, do you want to expand on the market?"

The ultra-deepwater market remains robust, and we continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect, certai",962,"All right. Take 2. Okay. Now, looking at the market -- we'll start with the ultra-deepwater segment. The ultra-deepwater market remains robust, and we continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect, certainly, new contract announcements here in the near term and in the next few months, possibly occupying up to 10 rigs in this segment. And with this, we believe now that 2013 is close to being sold-out and expect demand to continue to materialize into 2014, looking at the availability of rigs in that timeframe.
An example of this, there are multiple vendors out right now outstanding that could take an additional 5 rigs off the market in 2014, and we continue to see this come on as we go forward and expect more in the near future.
With respect to pricing, the recent announcements by some of our competitors clearly show that the market is now in the high 500s for 3- to 5-year term work. And we don't expect this to change as we go throughout the remainder of this year. Looking at the deepwater segment, it continues to be strong with the Gulf of Mexico and Africa, West Africa leading the demand. The recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale highlights the increased activity, and that we think is coming into the ultra-deepwater and deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico where sales generated approximately $1.7 billion in winning bids. So it's a bright future, we believe, for the Gulf.
Dayrates continue to increase with leading-edge rates in the high 400s to low 500s as seen with the rigs and fixtures including the Onyx. And finally, we don't see any new supply coming into this segment, other than what we've added recently with the Onyx and potentially the other rig Larry mentioned. So we continue to see this to be a tight market going forward and look positive beyond it.
Turning to the mid-water, this market is operating really as 2 distinct segments at the moment. You've got the very strong U.K. and Norwegian North Sea market that Larry mentioned. And then you got a steady to slightly increasing market in the remaining international segment or geographic regions.
As you can see from the extensions that we've recently announced yesterday, we're taking rigs now into 2015 and the resulting dayrates are continuing to increase. So the U.K. and North Sea and Norway is leading the charge, and we don't see a real visible end to this demand as we have customers continue to recourse rig time going forward.
In essence, 2013 in the North Sea is sold-out now. And like I said, we continue to have discussions, so we'll see how those develop and what capacity is available for them.
Looking at the Gulf of Mexico and other international locations in the mid-water market. And it continues to be a steady and slightly increasing market. We produced -- we continue to see additional demand coming online typically in the 6- to 9-month range with a bit of pricing power as we go forward but a very steady market at the moment.
So one of the things we wanted to address in this call was to look at our mid-water fleet and how we see it going through the regions going forward. Of course, I discussed the North Sea where we had 4 units or 25% of our fleet in this very strong market. We have 5 additional units with Petrobras and PEMEX, and they continue to utilize those with contracts out until late 2014 and 2015. Of course, there's been some news recently with OGX out of Brazil. I will speak there are 3 mid-water units currently under contract. The Ambassador is contracted until September of 2012; the Ocean Lexington, which is currently contracted until February of 2013; and the Ocean Quest under contract until the end of 2013.
Based on our conversations with OGX, we're currently discussing follow-on work for the Ambassador with other customers, assuming the rig will be released in September of this year. We also believe that they will re-lease the Lexington at the end of the contract in February 2013 and are already working on a follow-on term contract in direct continuation of that.
We are encouraged by both of these discussions, and we'll continue to update you as things develop. Finally, the Quest has approximately 18 months left on its contract, and we're comfortable with the rig's position with OGX there.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, the Saratoga recently finished its contract with Nexen. And it's currently hot stacked, awaiting its next contract. We believe the next contract will commence towards the end of the summer and should provide a steady stream of term work into 2013.
In Asia, we announced new contracts on both the Patriot and General. These [indiscernible] utilized into the first quarter of 2013 and are already seeing other operators line up to secure rig time behind these contracts. So with these rigs utilized or anticipating contracts, as I mentioned, that really only leaves the Ocean Whittington, which is currently undergoing evaluation to estimate the requirements for that rig to return to work.
So in summary, of our 16 mid-water units in our fleet, 4 are exposed to very strong North Sea market and has significant subcontracts; 5 are on long-term contracts with NOCs; and the remaining 6 are finding steady 6- to 9-month jobs with continued exposure to the increased pricing in the market as it improves.
Again, that only leaves the Whittington. And I think -- so you can see why we're pretty comfortable with our mid-water portfolio position and the cash flow stream that it produces.
With that summary of my market, Gary?"
338612,212275454,327609,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Michael. As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what we expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million",1373,"Okay. Thanks, Michael. As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what we expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million or $1.45 a share. That's up slightly from our Q1 report of $185 million after-tax income or $1.33 per share.
We did that despite contract drilling revenues decreasing from Q1 of $755 million to $726 million in Q2. The decrease in revenues was driven by the fact that we have 5 rigs down for special surveys in Q2 just as we had forecasted in our last conference call and reflected in our rig status report. This is versus only 1 down in the first quarter. This reduction in revenue was mitigated by the very good unplanned downtime that Larry talked about in his opening statement. And that helped offset downtime for the special surveys that we had.
As pointed out in the press release, we have 2 significant items outside of revenues that affected our earnings. Again, we have 5 jack-ups that we reported sold during the quarter: the Sovereign, the Heritage and 3 of our mat jack-ups. These -- the sale of these jack-ups resulted in about $15.5 million worth of gain or $0.36 per share aftertax.
The bulk gains reported on 2 of these rigs, the Sovereign and the Heritage, which was a vast majority of the total gain of $50 million, had no current tax expense associated with them. The result of them being owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries, in which profits are indefinitely reinvested and thus, not subject to the current U.S. taxes. In other words, we had a 0 tax rate on the gains on these rigs.
Which brings us to our second significant item in our income statement, our Q2 tax rate of 18.4%. The 18.4% was driven by a couple of items. One, just normal geography changes in our estimated earnings in the year between domestic and international as we always had. Also, the treatment from a tax standpoint for -- of capitalized interest that we recorded on the Ocean black line [ph] which we have announced in the second quarter. These 2 had small effects on our tax rate, dropping it slightly. But primarily, the factoring in of the additional $50 million of gain on the Sovereign and the Heritage was 0 tax rate. It was the main reason that the tax rate was driven down as far as it was.
These 3 items will also affect the ongoing tax rate for the remainder of the year, and I'll talk about that in a second. Looking at some of the specific line items on our income statement in Q2, contract drilling expense, we had guidance of $415 million, $430 million; and we actually came in at $405 million.
Several reasons for this: One, we thought we were going to begin a survey on the Whittington in Q2. We did not begin that work. We're still assessing the condition in that rig, as Michael talked about. And we also benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These 2 items would have brought us up close to the low-end of our guidance, maybe just slightly below. The rest of the favorable variance on our contract drilling expense due, as Larry said, to our concentrating on cost control [indiscernible] on the rigs and also the reduced unplanned downtime. Less unplanned downtime means less broken equipment plus repairs. And that benefited us not only on the revenue side but here on the cost side.
Looking at few of the other line items, G&A was $18.7 million, which was within our guidance. Depreciation was just slightly below what we guided to and that was driven by the sale of the Sovereign and the impact of spending depreciation on that rig. Interest was lower. We had guided $15 million and actually came in at $12.7 million. This again is attributable to capitalized interest on the Ocean black line [ph] and deposit [ph]. And finally, of course, the tax rate was substantially lower.
Other than gain on sale of assets on the income statement, there was nothing really on the income statement of note. Looking forward to the third quarter, one of the main drivers again will be downtime to the rig surveys. As we've been saying for some time now, both 2012 and 2013 are going to be heavy survey years for us. So this should come as no surprise what we've reported in the rig status report.
In the third quarter, we're anticipating that 6 rigs will be down for survey, 3 of them will begin in their surveys in the quarter [ph] and the 3 others were actually participating in surveys at Q2 and then will complete their surveys in the third quarter. In addition, the Ocean Summit or jack-up down in Mexico will be down for about 60 days doing some planned repairs and also some modifications required by PEMEX contract.
A couple of other rigs with scheduled downtime and again, I refer you to the rig status report for details on exactly what rig and what timing those will occur. This downtime, of course, will affect both revenues and cost in Q3.
Getting down to some of the specifics, contract drilling expense, we will again incur the normal daily operating cost by rig type and region that we gave out earlier in the year. In addition, the 6 rigs in the shipyard for survey, each survey will run somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of additional cost and will land about $25 million to $30 million for our total cost. We will also incur an additional about $12 million of amortized mobe cost. And again, these amortized mobe costs will be offset almost dollar-for-dollar by amortized mobe revenues.
If you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expense for the third quarter to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million. Again, I remind everybody that this $410 million to $425 million is for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs are not included in the amount I just gave you. If you look at those 2 together, you can just add another $10 million to $15 million worth of reimbursable costs, which will be offset also almost dollar-for-dollar by reimbursable revenues.
The other line item, G&A remains the same. Guidance, as before, is $17 million to $19 million a quarter. Depreciation, slightly lower guidance, down to $99 million to $101 million per quarter both for Q3 and Q4. And interest expense, we now believe, of the $22 million worth of gross interest expense will capitalize by $10 million in Q3 and Q4, which will leave us a net of about $11 million worth of expense. This again is an increased -- or the expenses decreased because of the black line [ph]. The effective tax rate we believe will now for Q3 and Q4 be somewhere between 22% and 25%. This reduction from prior guidance is the result of accounting rules, which has used spread of the 0 tax rate that was recorded on the sale of the jack-ups, not just in the quarter that occurred but you spread that over -- equally over all 4 quarters in the year. So again, 22% to 25% going forward.
And finally, capital expenditures, we now believe the maintenance capital will be somewhere in the $320 million range. And our newbuild, because of the black line [ph] and the Onyx, will be somewhere around $400 million for the year ended 2012, which gives us a total of $720 million.
One other item I'd like to mention before turning it back to Larry. For those who may have missed it, during the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to A3. This rating brings us in line with our Standard & Poor's rating of A- that's for some time now. With this upgrade, Diamond Offshore is now the only contract driller with an A3 or an A- rating in our industry, a reflection of the solid balance sheet and strong financial profile.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Larry."

And I will start by making some comments on the operating results and some of our future dayrates. So I'll be followed by Michael Acuff who will elaborate more on markets around the world in an opening statement. And then Gary Krenek, who's our CFO, will make some further commentary on the numbers that are in this quarter and how those may impact us on a go-forward basis.
First, on the operations, removing the items related to the sale of the jack-ups, we still substantially performed above our budget and the average industry consensus. And one thing I'd like to comment on there, we've got lots of initiatives ongoing that have been in place for a long time and some of those really were approved in this quarter, particularly efforts to reduce unplanned downtime.
We came in at 60 days of unplanned downtime. In other words, things that result from equipment breaking or being taken offline, where the rig has to suspend the operations during the quarter -- the past 2 quarters. And on a budgetary basis, we have experienced in the 140-day range and that's what we set as our budget for the year. We have previously performed better than that. We did a 110 days, I think, at end of last year. And we were in the 60s if you go back several years. But we were very pleased with that. And that's a reflection of our preventive maintenance program and the amount of spares that we have so that if equipment fails, we're able to very rapidly get that replaced.
And I'll just give you an example that's happened here right at the beginning of July. It wasn't in the quarter, but it's typical. On one of our rigs, during a routine maintenance inspection, one of our employees noted that some shivs [ph] on the  [indiscernible] compensator on a big rig appeared to have a crack. And I've seen photographs of what he looked at. And given the condition with grease and sea spray and all kind of things on it, it was really a tremendous catch. The rig was able to obviously -- again on top of this, instead of having a catastrophic failure, that could have had a -- been down for a longer period of time, but could have potential for injuries. We're able to get -- plan what we're going to do. Our initial plan was it may take 4 days, but due to the competency of our crews and great planning, they were able to execute this change in under 55 hours.
So those are the kind of efforts that are going on all of the time out there. And if you think about the difference between 140 days of downtime and 60 days of downtime, that 80 days of savings, if our average rate were at $300,000, that's $24 million in a quarter or about $0.12 to $0.13 that we would save as a result of that. So we're not always going to be able to achieve that, but we're certainly working hard to do that.
Additionally, our operating expenses were within or below budget across-the-board. Again, we're planning, making sure that we've got everything maintained, in great shape, gives you the opportunity to deliver those kind of numbers.
Moving beyond that and looking at the contracts that we announced, obviously, the Ocean Onyx, we were very pleased. We've worked for some time with Apache in -- a great customer. We enjoy working for them. The Onyx will be working in the Gulf of Mexico. So work is being done on that rig in Brownsville, so that it will be delivered and we will not have a long mobe with off time to get it to mid-water markets. And we're pleased with that.
And again, this reflects our faith in the deepwater market and particularly, in a  [indiscernible] solution, which is not always a [indiscernible] solution, but there a number of places where this plays out very well. Recently, we had announced the Ocean Victory, a little bit lesser capacity rig. It signed a job at $420 million. So this is a nice follow-on at these rates.
And I'll remind everybody that our cost of delivering this kind of capacity on Ocean Onyx is $300 million versus our new-builds, and we're pursuing those projects as well nearer the $650 million rate. And the new-builds -- we've seen some higher, higher dayrate recently obviously [indiscernible] but there, you're spending half of capital to deliver that. And our operating costs were greatly reduced on the Ocean Onyx because of the more simplistic design, yet it is still able to deliver the capability that's out there that's demanded by our customers. And there's very little competition in this space to be able to deliver rigs of this nature. In fact, we only have 1 more Victory-class rig in [indiscernible] the Ocean Bounty. That's located -- cold stacked in Singapore. And we are in the process of completing final engineering so that we may proceed further with a similar project on that particular rig.
And then next, we announced 3 big contracts in the North Sea. And I think Michael will be covering a lot of the deepwater market. But I would just say that this is reflective of an [indiscernible] a very strong market today. I don't know --  it wasn't too much long ago that the North Sea was generally condemned, and majors are moving out of there as those don't have a [indiscernible] future. Yet, we see this again and again in provinces that become re-energized based upon not only market conditions but new technologies that come out that enable our customers to make use of quicker ways to bring product onstream. There's a Brent premium right now. There has been for some time, and that makes the [indiscernible] work very well. It's very close to infrastructure. The drilling is not at great depths. You do have weather issues. But beyond that, it's a great area to drill in. And it's been a province of independence. We [indiscernible] Petroleum is our customer on the Ocean Nomad. Our Ocean Princess is working right now. It continues to work for Enquest. But we've seen Shell come forward. Shell is very active and already have the Ocean Guardian on a 2-year contract. And yet, as they look now on the road, they elected to add a third year on that contract to $350 million. And as the Vanguard, which is in Norway with Statoil, we got a 20-month extension, as we noted, and a nice increase.
So all of that being said, there's continued opportunities for our customers to explore and bring on production in mid-waters in the North Sea, both Norway and U.K. And it's a market where there's not a lot of new capacity or any capacity being brought on. It's a market where there's barriers to bringing rigs in. So it's very strong there. And I'll let Michael make any further comments on North Sea and also how that impacts worldwide.
The last thing I'll talk about here is the sale of jack-ups. We sold the Ocean Sovereign here in the quarter. And on top of the other jack-ups that we've sold, we continued to remove some of the older lesser capacity jack-ups from our fleet. I would say we have -- our focus is on ultra-deep, deep and mid-water units. And we continue to market those rigs around the world. We have a core of high-capacity jack-ups that are in Mexico, and we are planning to continue that. But the rest of our rigs, which are right now scattered around the world, jack-ups in 1 or 2 in different markets, we have been actively moving to sell those. And the market is such that we're able to bid those right now. So again, a very pleasing quarter for us.
Michael, do you want to expand on the market?"

Now, looking at the market -- we'll start with the ultra-deepwater segment. The ultra-deepwater market remains robust, and we continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect, certai",964,"All right. Take 2. Okay. Now, looking at the market -- we'll start with the ultra-deepwater segment. The ultra-deepwater market remains robust, and we continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect, certainly, new contract announcements here in the near term and in the next few months, possibly occupying up to 10 rigs in this segment. And with this, we believe now that 2013 is close to being sold-out and expect demand to continue to materialize into 2014, looking at the availability of rigs in that timeframe.
An example of this, there are multiple tenders out right now outstanding that could take an additional 5 rigs off the market in 2014, and we continue to see this come on as we go forward and expect more in the near future.
With respect to pricing, the recent announcements by some of our competitors clearly show that the market is now in the high 500s for 3- to 5-year term work. And we don't expect this to change as we go throughout the remainder of this year. Looking at the deepwater segment, it continues to be strong with the Gulf of Mexico and Africa, West Africa leading the demand. The recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale highlights the increased activity that we think is coming into the ultra-deepwater and deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico where sales generated approximately $1.7 billion in winning bids. So it's a bright future, we believe, for the Gulf.
Dayrates continue to increase with leading-edge rates in the high 400s to low 500s as seen with the rigs and fixtures including the Onyx. And finally, we don't see any new supply coming into this segment, other than what we've added recently with the Onyx and potentially the other rig Larry mentioned. So we continue to see this to be a tight market going forward and look positively on it.
Turning to the mid-water, this market is operating really as 2 distinct segments at the moment. You've got the very strong U.K. and Norwegian North Sea market that Larry mentioned. And then you got a steady to slightly increasing market in the remaining international segment or geographic regions.
As you can see from the extensions that we've recently announced yesterday, we're taking rigs now into 2015 and the resulting dayrates are continuing to increase. So the U.K. and North Sea and Norway is leading the charge, and we don't see a real visible end to this demand as we have customers continue to request rig time going forward.
In essence, 2013 in the North Sea is sold-out now. And like I say, we continue to have discussions, so we'll see how those develop and what capacity is available for them.
Looking at the Gulf of Mexico and other international locations in the mid-water market. And it continues to be a steady and slightly increasing market. We produced -- we continue to see additional demand coming online typically in the 6- to 9-month range with a bit of pricing power as we go forward but a very steady market at the moment.
So one of the things we wanted to address in this call was to look at our mid-water fleet and how we see it going through the regions going forward. Of course, I discussed the North Sea where we had 4 units or 25% of our fleet in this very strong market. We have 5 additional units with Petrobras and PEMEX, and they continue to utilize those with contracts out until late 2014 and 2015. Of course, there's been some news recently with OGX out of Brazil. I will speak there are 3 mid-water units currently under contract. The Ambassador is contracted until September of 2012; the Ocean Lexington, which is currently contracted until February of 2013; and the Ocean Quest under contract until the end of 2013.
Based on our conversations with OGX, we're currently discussing follow-on work for the Ambassador with other customers, assuming the rig will be released in September of this year. We also believe that they will re-lease the Lexington at the end of the contract in February 2013 and are already working on a follow-on term contract in direct continuation of that.
We are encouraged by both of these discussions, and we'll continue to update you as things develop. Finally, the Quest has approximately 18 months left on its contract, and we're comfortable with the rig's position with OGX there.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, the Saratoga recently finished its contract with Nexen. And it's currently hot stacked, awaiting its next contract. We believe the next contract will commence towards the end of the summer and should provide a steady stream of term work into 2013.
In Asia, we announced new contracts on both the Patriot and General. This should keep them utilized into the first quarter of 2013 and are already seeing other operators line up to secure rig time behind these contracts. So with these rigs utilized or anticipating contracts, as I mentioned, that really only leaves the Ocean Whittington, which is currently undergoing evaluation to estimate the requirements for that rig to return to work.
So in summary, of our 16 mid-water units in our fleet, 4 are exposed to very strong North Sea market and has significant term contracts; 5 are on long-term contracts with NOCs; and the remaining 6 are finding steady 6- to 9-month jobs with continued exposure to the increased pricing in the market as it improves.
Again, that only leaves the Whittington. And I think -- so you can see why we're pretty comfortable with our mid-water portfolio position and the cash flow stream that it produces.
With that summary of my market, Gary?"

As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what to expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million",1368,"Okay. Thanks, Michael. As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what to expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million or $1.45 a share. That's up slightly from our Q1 report of $185 million after-tax income or $1.33 per share.
We did that despite contract drilling revenues decreasing from Q1 of $755 million to $726 million in Q2. The decrease in revenues was driven by the fact that we have 5 rigs down for special surveys in Q2, just as we had forecasted in our last conference call and reflected in our rig status report. This is versus only 1 down in the first quarter. This reduction in revenue was mitigated by the very good unplanned downtime that Larry talked about in his opening statement. And that [indiscernible] helped offset downtime for the special surveys that we had.
As pointed out in the press release, we have 2 significant items outside of revenues that affected our earnings. Again, we have 5 jack-ups that we reported sold during the quarter: the Sovereign, the Heritage and 3 of our mat jack-ups. These -- the sale of these jack-ups resulted in about $15.5 million worth of gain or $0.36 per share aftertax.
The bulk gains reported on 2 of these rigs, the Sovereign and the Heritage, which was a vast majority of the total gain of $50 million, had no current tax expense associated with them. The result of them being owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries, in which profits are indefinitely reinvested, and thus not subject to the current U.S. taxes. In other words, we had a 0 tax rate on the gains on these rigs.
Which brings us to our second significant item in our income statement, our Q2 tax rate of 18.4%. The 18.4% was driven by a couple of items. One, just normal geography changes in our estimated earnings in the year between domestic and international as we always had. Also, the treatment from a tax standpoint for -- of capitalized interest that we recorded on the Ocean Blackline [ph], which we announced in the second quarter. These 2 had small effects on our tax rate, dropping it slightly. But primarily, the factoring in of the additional $50 million a gain on the Sovereign and the Heritage was 0 tax rate. It was the main reason that the tax rate was driven down as far as it was.
These 3 items will also affect the ongoing tax rate for the remainder of the year, and I'll talk about that in a second. Looking at some of the specific line items on our income statement in Q2, contract drilling expense, we had guidance of $415 million, $430 million; and we actually came in at $405 million.
Several reasons for this: One, we thought we were going to begin a survey on the Whittington in Q2. We did not begin that work. We're still assessing the condition in that rig, as Michael talked about. And we also benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These 2 items would have brought us up close to the low-end of our guidance, maybe just slightly below. The rest of the favorable variance on our contract drilling expense due, as Larry said, to our concentrating on cost control out there on the rigs and also the reduced unplanned downtime. Less unplanned downtime means less broken equipment, plus repairs. And that benefited us not only on the revenue side but here on the cost side.
Looking at a few of the other line items, G&A was $18.7 million, which was within our guidance. Depreciation was just slightly below what we guided to and that was driven by the sale of the Sovereign and the impact of spending depreciation on that rig. Interest was lower. We had guided $15 million and actually came in at $12.7 million. This again is attributable to capitalized interest on the Ocean black line and deposit. And finally, of course, the tax rate was substantially lower.
Other than gain on sale of assets on the income statement, there was nothing really on the income statement of note. Looking forward to the third quarter, one of the main drivers again will be downtime to the rig surveys. As we've been saying for some time now, both 2012 and 2013 are going to be heavy survey years for us. So this should come as no surprise what we've reported in the rig status report.
In the third quarter, we're anticipating that 6 rigs will be down for survey, 3 of them will begin in their surveys in the quarter; 3 others were actually participating in surveys at Q2 ended and then will complete their surveys in the third quarter. In addition, the Ocean Summit, our jack-up down in Mexico, will be down for about 60 days doing some planned repairs and also some modifications required by PEMEX contract.
A couple other rigs with scheduled downtime and again, I refer you to the rig status report for details on exactly what rig and what timing those will occur. This downtime, of course, will affect both revenues and cost in Q3.
Getting down to some of the specifics, contract drilling expense, we will again incur the normal daily operating cost by rig type and region that we gave out earlier in the year. In addition, the 6 rigs in the shipyard for survey, each survey will run somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of additional cost and will add about $25 million to $30 million for our total cost. We will also incur an additional about $12 million of amortized mobe cost. And again, these amortized mobe costs will be offset almost dollar-for-dollar by amortized mobe revenues.
If you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expense for the third quarter to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million. Again, I remind everybody that this $410 million to $425 million is for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs are not included in the amount I just gave you. If you look at those 2 together, you can just add another $10 million to $15 million worth of reimbursable costs, which will be offset also almost dollar-for-dollar by reimbursable revenues.
The other line item, G&A remains the same. Guidance, as before, is $17 million to $19 million a quarter. Depreciation, slightly lower guidance, down to $99 million to $101 million per quarter both for Q3 and Q4. And interest expense, we now believe, of the $22 million worth of gross interest expense will capitalize about $10 million in Q3 and Q4, which will leave us a net of about $11 million worth of expense. This again is an increased -- or the expenses decreased because of black line [ph]. The effective tax rate, we believe, will now, for Q3 and Q4, be somewhere between 22% and 25%. This reduction from prior guidance is a result of accounting rules, which has you spread of the 0 tax rate that was recorded on the sale of the jack-ups, not just in the quarter that occurred but you spread that over -- equally over all 4 quarters in the year. So again, 22% to 25% going forward.
And finally, capital expenditures, we now believe maintenance capital will be somewhere in the $320 million range. And our new-build, because of the black line [ph] and the Onyx, will be somewhere around $400 million for the year ended 2012, which gives us a total of $720 million.
One other item I'd like to mention before turning it back to Larry. For those who may have missed it, during the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to A3. This rating brings us in line with our Standard & Poor's rating of A- we've had for some time now. With this upgrade, Diamond Offshore is now the only contract driller with an A3 or an A- rating in our industry, a reflection of the solid balance sheet and strong financial profile.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Larry."

We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start by making some comments on the operating results and some of our future dayrates. So I'll be foll",1351,"Thank you, and welcome again to everyone for joining us. We were very pleased, obviously, with the results that we reported for the quarter. And I will start by making some comments on the operating results and some of our future dayrates. So I'll be followed by Michael Acuff who will elaborate more on markets around the world in an opening statement. And then Gary Krenek, who's our CFO, will make some further commentary on the numbers that are in this quarter and how those may impact us on a go-forward basis.
First, on the operations, removing the items related to the sale of the jack-ups, we still substantially performed above our budget and the average industry consensus. And one thing I'd like to comment on there, we've got lots of initiatives ongoing that have been in place for a long time and some of those really were approved in this quarter, particularly efforts to reduce unplanned downtime.
We came in at 60 days of unplanned downtime. In other words, things that result from equipment breaking or being taken offline, where the rig has to suspend the operations during the quarter -- the past 2 quarters. And on a budgetary basis, we have experienced in the 140-day range and that's what we set as our budget for the year. We have previously performed better than that. We did a 110 days, I think, at end of last year. And we were in the 60s if you go back several years. But we were very pleased with that. And that's a reflection of our preventive maintenance program and the amount of spares that we have so that if equipment fails, we're able to very rapidly get that replaced.
And I'll just give you an example that's happened here right at the beginning of July. It wasn't in the quarter, but it's typical. On one of our rigs, during a routine maintenance inspection, one of our employees noted that some shivs [ph] on the [indiscernible] compensator on a big rig appeared to have a crack. And I've seen photographs of what he looked at. And given the condition with grease and sea spray and all kind of things on it, it was really a tremendous catch. The rig was able to obviously -- again on top of this, instead of having a catastrophic failure, that could have had a -- been down for a longer period of time, but could have potential for injuries. We're able to get -- plan what we're going to do. Our initial plan was it may take 4 days, but due to the competency of our crews and great planning, they were able to execute this change in under 55 hours.
So those are the kind of efforts that are going on all of the time out there. And if you think about the difference between 140 days of downtime and 60 days of downtime, that 80 days of savings, if our average rate were at $300,000, that's $24 million in a quarter or about $0.12 to $0.13 that we would save as a result of that. So we're not always going to be able to achieve that, but we're certainly working hard to do that.
Additionally, our operating expenses were within or below budget across-the-board. Again, we're planning, making sure that we've got everything maintained, in great shape, gives you the opportunity to deliver those kind of numbers.
Moving beyond that and looking at the contracts that we announced, obviously, the Ocean Onyx, we were very pleased. We've worked for some time with Apache in -- a great customer. We enjoy working for them. The Onyx will be working in the Gulf of Mexico. So work is being done on that rig in Brownsville, so that it will be delivered and we will not have a long mobe with off time to get it to mid-water markets. And we're pleased with that.
And again, this reflects our faith in the deepwater market and particularly, in a  [indiscernible] solution, which is not always a [indiscernible] solution, but there a number of places where this plays out very well. Recently, we had announced the Ocean Victory, a little bit lesser capacity rig. It signed a job at $420 million. So this is a nice follow-on at these rates.
And I'll remind everybody that our cost of delivering this kind of capacity on Ocean Onyx is $300 million versus our newbuilds, and we're pursuing those projects as well nearer the $650 million rate. And the newbuilds -- we've seen some higher, higher dayrate recently obviously [indiscernible] but there, you're spending half of capital to deliver that. And our operating costs were greatly reduced on the Ocean Onyx because of the more simplistic design, yet it is still able to deliver the capability that's out there that's demanded by our customers. And there's very little competition in this space to be able to deliver rigs of this nature. In fact, we only have 1 more Victory-class rig in [indiscernible] the Ocean Bounty. That's located -- cold stacked in Singapore. And we are in the process of completing final engineering so that we may proceed further with a similar project on that particular rig.
And then next, we announced 3 big contracts in the North Sea. And I think Michael will be covering a lot of the deepwater market. But I would just say that this is reflective of an [indiscernible] a very strong market today. I don't know -- it wasn't too much long ago that the North Sea was generally condemned, and majors are moving out of there as those don't have a [indiscernible] future. Yet, we see this again and again in provinces that become re-energized based upon not only market conditions but new technologies that come out that enable our customers to make use of quicker ways to bring product onstream. There's a Brent premium right now. There has been for some time, and that makes the [indiscernible] work very well. It's very close to infrastructure. The drilling is not at great depths. You do have weather issues. But beyond that, it's a great area to drill in. And it's been a province of independence. We [indiscernible] Petroleum is our customer on the Ocean Nomad. Our Ocean Princess is working right now. It continues to work for Enquest. But we've seen Shell come forward. Shell is very active and already have the Ocean Guardian on a 2-year contract. And yet, as they look now on the road, they elected to add a third year on that contract to $350 million. And as the Vanguard, which is in Norway with Statoil, we got a 20-month extension, as we noted, and a nice increase.
So all of that being said, there's continued opportunities for our customers to explore and bring on production in mid-waters in the North Sea, both Norway and U.K. And it's a market where there's not a lot of new capacity or any capacity being brought on. It's a market where there's barriers to bringing rigs in. So it's very strong there. And I'll let Michael make any further comments on North Sea and also how that impacts worldwide.
The last thing I'll talk about here is the sale of jack-ups. We sold the Ocean Sovereign here in the quarter. And on top of the other jack-ups that we've sold, we continued to remove some of the older lesser capacity jack-ups from our fleet. I would say we have -- our focus is on ultra-deep, deep and mid-water units. And we continue to market those rigs around the world. We have a core of high-capacity jack-ups that are in Mexico, and we are planning to continue that. But the rest of our rigs, which are right now scattered around the world, jack-ups in 1 or 2 in different markets, we have been actively moving to sell those. And the market is such that we're able to bid those right now. So again, a very pleasing quarter for us.
Michael, do you want to expand on the market?"

Now, looking at the market -- we'll start with the ultra-deepwater segment. The ultra-deepwater market remains robust, and we continue to see demand materialize in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and East Africa. We expect, certainly, new contract announcements here in the near term and in the next few months, possibly occupying up to 10 rigs in this segment. And with this, we believe now that 2013 is close to being sold-out and expect demand to continue to materialize into 2014, looking at the availability of rigs in that timeframe.
An example of this, there are multiple tenders out right now outstanding that could take an additional 5 rigs off the market in 2014, and we continue to see this come on as we go forward and expect more in the near future.
With respect to pricing, the recent announcements by some of our competitors clearly show that the market is now in the high 500s for 3- to 5-year term work. And we don't expect this to change as we go throughout the remainder of this year. Looking at the deepwater segment, it continues to be strong with the Gulf of Mexico and Africa, West Africa leading the demand. The recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale highlights the increased activity that we think is coming into the ultra-deepwater and deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico where sales generated approximately $1.7 billion in winning bids. So it's a bright future, we believe, for the Gulf.
Dayrates continue to increase with leading-edge rates in the high 400s to low 500s as seen with the rigs and fixtures including the Onyx. And finally, we don't see any new supply coming into this segment, other than what we've added recently with the Onyx and potentially the other rig Larry mentioned. So we continue to see this to be a tight market going forward and look positively on it.
Turning to the mid-water, this market is operating really as 2 distinct segments at the moment. You've got the very strong U.K. and Norwegian North Sea market that Larry mentioned. And then you got a steady to slightly increasing market in the remaining international segment or geographic regions.
As you can see from the extensions that we've recently announced yesterday, we're taking rigs now into 2015 and the resulting dayrates are continuing to increase. So the U.K. and North Sea and Norway is leading the charge, and we don't see a real visible end to this demand as we have customers continue to request rig time going forward.
In essence, 2013 in the North Sea is sold-out now. And like I say, we continue to have discussions, so we'll see how those develop and what capacity is available for them.
Looking at the Gulf of Mexico and other international locations in the mid-water market. And it continues to be a steady and slightly increasing market. We produced -- we continue to see additional demand coming online typically in the 6- to 9-month range with a bit of pricing power as we go forward but a very steady market at the moment.
So one of the things we wanted to address in this call was to look at our mid-water fleet and how we see it going through the regions going forward. Of course, I discussed the North Sea where we had 4 units or 25% of our fleet in this very strong market. We have 5 additional units with Petrobras and PEMEX, and they continue to utilize those with contracts out until late 2014 and 2015. Of course, there's been some news recently with OGX out of Brazil. I will speak there are 3 mid-water units currently under contract. The Ambassador is contracted until September of 2012; the Ocean Lexington, which is currently contracted until February of 2013; and the Ocean Quest under contract until the end of 2013.
Based on our conversations with OGX, we're currently discussing follow-on work for the Ambassador with other customers, assuming the rig will be released in September of this year. We also believe that they will re-lease the Lexington at the end of the contract in February 2013 and are already working on a follow-on term contract in direct continuation of that.
We are encouraged by both of these discussions, and we'll continue to update you as things develop. Finally, the Quest has approximately 18 months left on its contract, and we're comfortable with the rig's position with OGX there.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, the Saratoga recently finished its contract with Nexen. And it's currently hot stacked, awaiting its next contract. We believe the next contract will commence towards the end of the summer and should provide a steady stream of term work into 2013.
In Asia, we announced new contracts on both the Patriot and General. This should keep them utilized into the first quarter of 2013 and are already seeing other operators line up to secure rig time behind these contracts. So with these rigs utilized or anticipating contracts, as I mentioned, that really only leaves the Ocean Whittington, which is currently undergoing evaluation to estimate the requirements for that rig to return to work.
So in summary, of our 16 mid-water units in our fleet, 4 are exposed to very strong North Sea market and has significant term contracts; 5 are on long-term contracts with NOCs; and the remaining 6 are finding steady 6- to 9-month jobs with continued exposure to the increased pricing in the market as it improves.
Again, that only leaves the Whittington. And I think -- so you can see why we're pretty comfortable with our mid-water portfolio position and the cash flow stream that it produces.
With that summary of my market, Gary?"
338612,212275454,328112,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Michael. As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what to expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million",1369,"Okay. Thanks, Michael. As always, I'll make a few comments on this past quarter, and we'll turn to what to expect in Q3 and Q4 and the remainder of this year. Looking at our results for the second quarter, we reported after-tax net income of $201 million or $1.45 a share. That's up slightly from our Q1 report of $185 million after-tax income or $1.33 per share.
We did that despite contract drilling revenues decreasing from Q1 of $755 million to $726 million in Q2. The decrease in revenues was driven by the fact that we have 5 rigs down for special surveys in Q2, just as we had forecasted in our last conference call and reflected in our rig status report. This is versus only 1 down in the first quarter. This reduction in revenue was mitigated by the very good unplanned downtime that Larry talked about in his opening statement. And that [indiscernible] helped offset downtime for the special surveys that we had.
As pointed out in the press release, we have 2 significant items outside of revenues that affected our earnings. Again, we have 5 jack-ups that we reported sold during the quarter: the Sovereign, the Heritage and 3 of our mat jack-ups. These -- the sale of these jack-ups resulted in about $15.5 million worth of gain or $0.36 per share after tax.
The bulk gains reported on 2 of these rigs, the Sovereign and the Heritage, which was a vast majority of the total gain of $50 million, had no current tax expense associated with them. The result of them being owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries, in which profits are indefinitely reinvested, and thus not subject to the current U.S. taxes. In other words, we had a 0 tax rate on the gains on these rigs.
Which brings us to our second significant item in our income statement, our Q2 tax rate of 18.4%. The 18.4% was driven by a couple of items. One, just normal geography changes in our estimated earnings in the year between domestic and international as we always had. Also, the treatment from a tax standpoint for -- of capitalized interest that we recorded on the Ocean Blackline [ph], which we announced in the second quarter. These 2 had small effects on our tax rate, dropping it slightly. But primarily, the factoring in of the additional $50 million a gain on the Sovereign and the Heritage was 0 tax rate. It was the main reason that the tax rate was driven down as far as it was.
These 3 items will also affect the ongoing tax rate for the remainder of the year, and I'll talk about that in a second. Looking at some of the specific line items on our income statement in Q2, contract drilling expense, we had guidance of $415 million, $430 million; and we actually came in at $405 million.
Several reasons for this: One, we thought we were going to begin a survey on the Whittington in Q2. We did not begin that work. We're still assessing the condition in that rig, as Michael talked about. And we also benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These 2 items would have brought us up close to the low-end of our guidance, maybe just slightly below. The rest of the favorable variance on our contract drilling expense due, as Larry said, to our concentrating on cost control out there on the rigs and also the reduced unplanned downtime. Less unplanned downtime means less broken equipment, plus repairs. And that benefited us not only on the revenue side but here on the cost side.
Looking at a few of the other line items, G&A was $18.7 million, which was within our guidance. Depreciation was just slightly below what we guided to and that was driven by the sale of the Sovereign and the impact of spending depreciation on that rig. Interest was lower. We had guided $15 million and actually came in at $12.7 million. This again is attributable to capitalized interest on the Ocean black line and deposit. And finally, of course, the tax rate was substantially lower.
Other than gain on sale of assets on the income statement, there was nothing really on the income statement of note. Looking forward to the third quarter, one of the main drivers again will be downtime to the rig surveys. As we've been saying for some time now, both 2012 and 2013 are going to be heavy survey years for us. So this should come as no surprise what we've reported in the rig status report.
In the third quarter, we're anticipating that 6 rigs will be down for survey, 3 of them will begin in their surveys in the quarter; 3 others were actually participating in surveys at Q2 ended and then will complete their surveys in the third quarter. In addition, the Ocean Summit, our jack-up down in Mexico, will be down for about 60 days doing some planned repairs and also some modifications required by PEMEX contract.
A couple other rigs with scheduled downtime and again, I refer you to the rig status report for details on exactly what rig and what timing those will occur. This downtime, of course, will affect both revenues and cost in Q3.
Getting down to some of the specifics, contract drilling expense, we will again incur the normal daily operating cost by rig type and region that we gave out earlier in the year. In addition, the 6 rigs in the shipyard for survey, each survey will run somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of additional cost and will add about $25 million to $30 million for our total cost. We will also incur an additional about $12 million of amortized mobe cost. And again, these amortized mobe costs will be offset almost dollar-for-dollar by amortized mobe revenues.
If you add all of that up, we expect contract drilling expense for the third quarter to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million. Again, I remind everybody that this $410 million to $425 million is for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs are not included in the amount I just gave you. If you look at those 2 together, you can just add another $10 million to $15 million worth of reimbursable costs, which will be offset also almost dollar-for-dollar by reimbursable revenues.
The other line item, G&A remains the same. Guidance, as before, is $17 million to $19 million a quarter. Depreciation, slightly lower guidance, down to $99 million to $101 million per quarter both for Q3 and Q4. And interest expense, we now believe, of the $22 million worth of gross interest expense will capitalize about $10 million in Q3 and Q4, which will leave us a net of about $11 million worth of expense. This again is an increased -- or the expenses decreased because of black line [ph]. The effective tax rate, we believe, will now, for Q3 and Q4, be somewhere between 22% and 25%. This reduction from prior guidance is a result of accounting rules, which has you spread of the 0 tax rate that was recorded on the sale of the jack-ups, not just in the quarter that occurred but you spread that over -- equally over all 4 quarters in the year. So again, 22% to 25% going forward.
And finally, capital expenditures, we now believe maintenance capital will be somewhere in the $320 million range. And our new-build, because of the black line [ph] and the Onyx, will be somewhere around $400 million for the year ended 2012, which gives us a total of $720 million.
One other item I'd like to mention before turning it back to Larry. For those who may have missed it, during the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to A3. This rating brings us in line with our Standard & Poor's rating of A- we've had for some time now. With this upgrade, Diamond Offshore is now the only contract driller with an A3 or an A- rating in our industry, a reflection of the solid balance sheet and strong financial profile.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Larry."

I got 4 points I'd like to talk about in my opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to Michael Acuff to expand on the market and then Gary Krenek will walk you through the numbers",1028,"Thank you very much, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I got 4 points I'd like to talk about in my opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to Michael Acuff to expand on the market and then Gary Krenek will walk you through the numbers in a little bit more detail. 
First and most significant, I think, is the 4 commitments that we announced in this press release and a recent filing of our rig status report, but primarily in this press release. First, I'd like to comment on the Ocean America and Ocean Valiant, which were fifth-generation rigs. Ocean America, we signed up in Australia 18-month commitment, with Chevron at 4 75. I think that reflects a little bit that's one of our lower rates that we have and little higher cost area, it's still a solid profitable rate that will do very well but it reflects Pacific may be the weakest of the markets that we operate in or I'd rather say, least strong because it's still a nice market. 
Over in Africa with the Valiant, extended short-term for Hesse and moved its rate from a 300 up to 5 15 is I think reflective of a decent market, and that's a continuation of the 4 90 rate that we booked on our new capacity rig, the Ocean Onyx, in the Gulf of Mexico. 
And it's important to remember that these fourth generation rigs are and they have substantially less operating cost, crews, marine crews and maintenance expenditures than you'll find on your fifth and sixth generation rigs. So the margins that we are likely to earn on the Valiant in West Africa at this point will be very close to what sixth generation rigs will be earning.
On the higher spec rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, we announced an 18-month commitment at what we are calling 5 21, which is 5 0 5 plus half of the 6.6% bonus, which is what for budget and SEC purpose we see that we typically earn, we never earn 100% across of our fleet, but we do typically 50% or better on those. So that's a solid rate coming up from a post rate that we've been working on in high 200s in Egypt and this work will be at a location outside the Mediterranean. 
Then additionally, the Ocean Lexington will be released by OGX from, that's been talked about for some period of time. And we secured a greater than 12-month commitment for the rig in Trinidad with a consortium of companies at 300 a day. So that's about a $50,000 uptick from the price we're working in Brazil, and we're anticipating very substantial reduction in cost, Brazil being our highest cost location that we work in and Trinidad won't be as cheap as Gulf of Mexico it should be cheaper. So that will be a nice profitable job for us. 
And in addition to that, there's some other patriot in the Pacific and Saratoga I believe we announced just recently in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's really one of the few mid-water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. So that's doing very well.
On the performance for the quarter, we're very pleased with our operating expense. We've continued quarter after quarter to just stay very tight within our budget, and this is in spite of the fact that conditions do change on us and there are a lot of cost-inflation pressures, but the people that look at our fleet just continue to do a very, very good job. This was offset somewhat by a little bit impact on the revenues as our unanticipated equipment downtime reached 159 days in the quarter. If you look back, last quarter, we made an all-time record of only 60 days across the fleet, but the 3 preceding quarters were in the 140s to as low as 110. So we are up from where we were there, and the downtime was concentrated on 2 fifth-generation rigs, which helped hurt really to get some high dayrates that we lost time line. But the rest of the fleet did very, very well and performed well under what our expectations are. And so, it wasn't as big of an impact as we would have was had and having the risk of downtime on rigs due to equipment failures or maintenance or even the higher standards that the whole industry looks towards in a post-Macondo world, our continuing risk as we go forward, but we're comfortable on a rolling quarter basis that we we'll be able to perform within tolerance and not have that. But again, the outstanding performance on our operating expense got us to where we want to be. Last 2 comments are on the financial areas. One, as previously noted, we did put in place a bank facility at $750 million. We have no plans to immediately go down. And of course, that's for general corporate purposes. But if you look at as our drillships are delivered, we've got 70% due do for those. We've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so that will be a primarily source of financing that we felt that this was something that it for us to have. The rates that we've got on that were outstanding. We are the only A rated by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's drilling contractor in the space, and I think that was reflected in the rates that we obtained. 
And then the final financial thing that I would note is we again declared a regular and special dividend at same rates that have been in effect for some bit of time. And this brings our cumulative payments since we began our dividend program a number of years ago at $34 a share, so that's added to the share price is for our long-term shareholders reflects the value that we return and puts us certainly in the top tier of offshore drilling companies combined share performance and dividends. So that's my summary of how I saw the quarter, and I'll let Michael talk a little bit more about where the markets are."

The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll",784,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending the call. The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll discuss each of the market segments, but in general we are pleased with the state of the business and believe that it should remain strong going forward into 2013. 
So looking at the market segments, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets continue to show strength worldwide with the concentration of incremental demand continuing to reside in Australia, West Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Several new fixtures with strong dayrates have been announced over the past 3 months, and we believe this momentum in the market will continue for the foreseeable future.
As stated in our earnings announcement, we recently signed the Ocean Endeavor to a Worldwide contract with an unnamed operator for 18 months at $505,000 per day, plus a potential 6.6% bonus up from the current operating rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, we contracted the Ocean America with Chevron, as Larry said, for 18 months in Australia at a dayrate of $475,000 per day versus the current dayrate of $405,000. And then finally, the Ocean Valiant was extended for another 2 wells at $515,000 to continue for offshore Equatorial Guinea. 
We're quite pleased with all 3 of these fixtures and our current deepwater and ultra-deepwater portfolio going forward in 2013 and 2014. We believe we're well positioned with our 2 uncontracted new-build drillships, the Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean Black Lion along with our new deepwater semisubmersible the Ocean Apex, all of which are due to be delivered in 2014. With respect to ultra-deepwater pricing, recent fixtures in the market continue to demonstrate that rates for 3-year deals are hovering around the $600,000 per day Mark, with West Africa fixtures typically higher by another $20,000 to $30,000 a day. For contracts with longer-term up to 5 years potentially rates have been settling in the high 500s where I would expect them to remain for the near future.
Turning to deepwater, we continue to see pricing momentum that has now taken us over the $500,000 per day mark for work under a year with longer-term contracts in the high 400s. We believe this will continue with steady deepwater demand materializing for 2014. 
For example, Australia that continues to move forward with our explosion programs and LNG-related development projects. West Africa exploration efforts are currently strong in countries such as Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, was significant demand for development projects are being seen in Angola, Ghana and Nigeria to name a few. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we've seen a resurgence in activity in the deepwater in ultra-deepwater arenas over the past year and are now approaching pre-Macondo activity levels with expectations of continued demand, taking this up to possibly 40 rigs in 2013.
In the mid-water segment of our business, as we stated on our last call, the market continues to operate as 2 distinct segments, the very strong North Sea region and the other international in U.S. Gulf of Mexico markets that remained steady. In the North Sea the operators continue to see great availability which is at a premium and are currently planning for slots in late 2013 and 2014. For example, we are seeing significant interest in the Ocean Princess, which end its current contract in August 2013. Subject to its options of course with operators looking at an average of 2 years of term commitment. 
Additionally, we have had discussions with several operators on relocating additional existing capacity to the region with the potential for a term contract. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other international locations outside the North Sea, the market continues to be steady with slightly increasing and has produced additional demand with some pricing power. Our announcement yesterday on the Ocean Lexington and its contract with the group of BG Centrica Anne Nicco is a positive data point for this segment, with an increasing rate and a term commitment for a group of operators. 
Our other mid-water rigs, the Saratoga, patriot and general, continue to build short-term backlog while remaining steady for the dayrate perspective. The Ocean Ambassador, which just left Brazil to return to the U.S. Gulf o Mexico is a rig we are focusing on as we are discussing opportunities with operators be the intent to secure contract in the next few months. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the direction of the market and the future strength of the offshore drilling business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
338612,217825553,366310,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million or $1.28 per share on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results, when we reported $201 million after-tax in",1517,"Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million or $1.28 per share on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results, when we reported $201 million after-tax income or $1.45 per share. The primary reason though for that decrease was in the second quarter, if you recall, we sold 5 of our jack-up rigs and recorded a gain of about $50 million or after-tax EPS of $0.36 a share. So if you take that out of the mix, we actually increased our earnings quarter-over-quarter. As Larry said, one of the reasons for that increase in earnings was our lower anticipated rig operating cost. So looking back at the guidance that we gave last quarter, I have told everyone that we expected operating cost to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million, and we actually came in at $357 million, substantial dip. Part of that the cost is a result of some timing issues. We had anticipated the ocean worker would undergo survey in the fourth quarter and that has been pushed back in its entirety to the third -- we thought it was going to be the third quarter, we pushed it back in its entirety to the fourth quarter. Also the Ocean Victory was the most of its survey in Q3, and it's moved most of it back to Q4. We began the very first part of it in Q3. If you look at those 2 things, we believe about $15 million worth of cost were pushed from Q3 into Q4. In addition to that, we had about $10 million of currency -- favorable currency issues out there. We in our cost estimates for the quarter, we anticipated the U.S. dollar being what we were at when we budgeted for the year and dollars have been stronger than that. So that gave us about a $10 million favorable variance. So those 2, in total, both timing and U.S. dollar is about $25 million. The remaining portion, though, of the comes from just general cost controls. We had about $7 million worth of estimate the actual adjustments during the quarter. These are items that we had anticipated cost in prior quarters and booked expenses, and they actually came in lower than what we had anticipated and therefore we turned those accruals around in Q3 as we became comfortable of what the actual costs were. So that $7 million doesn't necessarily relate to Q3 but does relate to prior quarters where cost came in a little bit lower than the good numbers that we reported then. We have a number of surveys in Q3. Those surveys came in about $8 million, below our expectations. Again, just watching the dollars. We had about a $5 million adjustment on our reserve for our Jones Act's claims. This is not something that we estimate our sales would rather go to an outside third party actuaries and have them estimate our reserves for us and that we do that on a quarterly basis. And so this quarter came back with a $5 million credit. This is a reflection, I think, of 2 things. Number one, our incident rate is in for safety is the best that it's ever been, and so that's reflected in this credit. And not only is the incident rate down, but the severity of the incidents we are having is down. And so, that has been bit of a cost to us. 
In addition to that, we had about $15 million more of what I would just term general cost savings and cost control spread throughout the fleet, much of it in our supply and maintenance expense. Again, as Larry pointed out, the guys out on the rigs that are in charge of is doing a very good job, and we're very happy with that. 
Looking at some of the other lines on the income statement, our G&A costs were a little bit lower than expected. Part of this was due to about a $2.5 million accounting adjustment that we had during the quarter. Interest expense was down by $2 million below what our expectations were. We benefited here from a favorable resolution to a tax audit that we had reserved for in our FIN 48 accrual. This has been going on for a number of years, it relates to one of our rig international subsidiaries, and we had a favorable resolution. We were able to turn that reserve around. It only affected the tax line by about $1 million, $1.5 million, so have lost in the rounding on taxes. But we had also recorded $2.5 million worth of interest on that accrual. And since we were successful in defending ourselves there, we were able to turn that around and that came out of our interest expense line. 
Depreciation of $99 million was within our guidance and our tax rate of 24.1% was within the guidance that I gave, which was 22% to 25%. So a little bit toward the top end of it, but still within the range that we expected.
Looking forward to the third quarter, as always, planned downtime will affect both our earnings and our cost. For the quarter, we are anticipating that the Ocean Worker will be down about 65 days for its 5-year survey. We will complete the Victory survey that was begun by 15 down days in Q3, it will have an additional 45 down days in the fourth quarter and we expect to begin the Quest about December 1 which will result in 31 down days. So the total add up it's about 140 days on those of 3 rigs for survey. 
In addition, the Ocean Saratoga is currently on a standby rate with BP. For accounting reasons, we are not recognizing any of those revenues that we've earned for the first 45 days of the quarter. Rather, what we will do is defer those earnings and amortize them over the remaining portion of the contract. So essentially, you'll have 45 days from an accounting standpoint of 0 revenue coming in, even though we are actually able to build that on our ongoing basis. 
The Ambassador is, as Michael said, is preparing to move back to the Gulf of Mexico, we believe it's about down 60 days before it gets here and totally complete its mobe. And as always, I refer you to the rig status report for details on these down times and exact dates and further information on it.
Getting down to specifics on cost for that we expect in the fourth quarter. Again, as always a normal daily operating expense on our rigs that we gave some guidance out early on the year, will occur the cost for the surveys I talked about we're estimating about $17 million. The Worker is a larger survey, more days, and we've got some stuff we want to do at that rig. It will be about 10 just for that rig. So we'll have $17 million there. Amortize mobe, approximately $13 million is what we're expecting for the quarter. Again, this will be offset by mobe revenues pretty much dollar for dollar. The Ambassador mobile back to the Gulf will currently probably about $6 million. This time, we are factoring in the strength of the U.S. dollar, so we're taking that into account and assuming that the dollar will stay strong, so we've reduced our expectations for that. 
And then finally, during the fourth quarter, historically, we've always seen our major project expense number go up as we complete projects that we've budgeted at the beginning of the year and said historically that's always been the highest in the fourth quarter, so we try to build that into our numbers. If you take all of that into account and we believe the contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter will be between $390 million to $410 million. As always, I would note this is contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to the amount that I just gave you.
A few other lines. G&A, we believe that will return back to the $17 million, $18 million, which we've historically recorded over the past 6 or 7 quarters. Appreciation, same guidance as last quarter, $99 million to $101 million. And interest expense, we believe, will return to its normal cost, which is the $22 million which is what our outstanding debt brings us less $10 million worth of capital interest or a net of $11 million. The Effective tax rate will increase just slightly over last time. We believe it will be somewhere between the 23% to 26% range. And finally, capital expense, we are increasing our expected capital from $720 million to $800 million, and that's to reflect the Ocean Apex rig that we announced earlier in the call and that $800 million will be broken down between maintenance capital of $320 million and our new-build rigs we expect to spend about $480 million. And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

That premium and everything makes it really, really good. There are not that many rigs that are capable of working in the North Sea. I mean this is the safety case. There's standards that have to be met. And we believe that we may possess a few rigs on our fleet, not many, in the mid-water segment that could be relocated to that market.

Michael, you characterized the mid-water is still improving in the North Sea and still steady in the rest of world.

Of course, as Larry said, we believe we'll have some gains from an operating cost standpoint, moving that rig into the Trinidad market. It just depends on the rig capability. You've got thousand foot mid-water rigs and you've got 3,500-foot mid-water rigs. So that capability then trickles into the pricing advantages and opportunities. But I think the upper end of the mid-water is in the high 2s and you know more your standard 1,500-foot type mid-water rigs are in the mid-2s. That's -- it was a great contract for us. We're very excited about it. The ability to get that type of term in the mid-water segment's just not everywhere we look, it's more short-term as you see with the Patriot and General. You get 90 days, you get 120-day job. So until we start seeing that term build up, I think you will continue to see the rates were they are, and that's the reason I made my steady comment versus increasing. But where it's possible, obviously we'll take advantage of the pricing power and opportunities with the rigs we have to put them into good markets with better margin environment. So we're quite excited about the Lexington."

So we certainly will have a better guess for you and better estimates in our next quarterly conference call. And then the second question, reducing cost in this quarter, nothing that I can put my finger on. Part of it is just being a little bit more efficient, not being in the shipyard quite as long. If we can say 2 or 3 days, that can save a lot of money for us. Also, when we do some of our estimates, we're trying to estimate how much it cost to mobe in and out. And it's very easy to miss those estimates by $0.5 million to $0.75 million.

I think that reflects a little bit -- though that's one of the lower rates that we have and it's a little higher cost area, it's still a solid profitable rate that will do very well on, but it reflects that the Pacific maybe the weakest of the markets that we operate in or, I'd rather say, least strong because it's still -- it is a nice market.
Over in Africa, where the Valiant extended a short-term for Hess and moved its rate from a $300,000 up to $515,000 is, I think, reflective of a decent market, and that's a continuation of the 490,000 rate that we booked on our new capacity rig, the Ocean Onyx, in the Gulf of Mexico.
And it's important to remember that these fourth-generation rigs are moored, and they have substantially less operating cost, crews, marine crews and maintenance expenditures than you'll find on your fifth and sixth-generation rigs. So the margins that we are likely to earn on the Valiant in West Africa at this point will be very, very close to what sixth-generation rigs will be earning.
On the higher spec rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, we announced an 18-month commitment at a -- we're calling $521,000, which is $505,000 plus half of a 6.6% bonus, which is what, for budget and SEC purposes, we say that we typically earn. We never earn 100% across our fleet, but we do typically 50% or better on those. So that's a solid rate coming up from a post-Macondo rate that we've been working on in the high-200s in Egypt, and this work will be at a location outside the Mediterranean.
Then additionally, the Ocean Lexington will be released by OGX from Brazil. That's been talked about for some period of time. And we secured a greater than 12-month commitment for the rig in Trinidad with a consortium of companies at $300,000 a day. So that's about a $50,000 uptick from the price we're working in, in Brazil, and we're anticipating a very substantial reduction in cost, Brazil being our highest-cost location that we work in. And Trinidad won't be as cheap as the Gulf of Mexico, but it should be substantially cheaper. So that will be a nice profitable job for us.
And in addition to that, there's some other -- Patriot in the Pacific. And Saratoga, I believe, we announced just recently in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's really one of the few mid-water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. So that's doing very well.
On the performance for the quarter, we're very pleased with our operating expense. We've continued quarter-after-quarter to just stay very tight within our budget, and this is in spite of the fact that conditions do change on us and there are a lot of cost inflation pressures. But the people that look after our fleet just continue to do a very, very good job.
This was offset somewhat by a little bit of impact on the revenues as our unanticipated equipment downtime reached 159 days in the quarter. If you look back, last quarter, we made an all-time record of only 60 days across the fleet, but the 3 preceding quarters were in the 140s to as low as 110. So we're up from where we were there. And the downtime was concentrated on 2 fifth-generation rigs, which helped -- hurt really to get some high dayrates that we lost time on. But the rest of the fleet did very, very well and performed well under what our expectations are.
And so it wasn't as big of an impact as we would have otherwise had and having the risk of downtime on rigs due to equipment failures or maintenance or even the higher standards that the whole industry looks towards in a post-Macondo world, our continuing risk as we go forward, but we're comfortable on a rolling quarter basis that we will be able to perform within tolerance and not have that. But again, the outstanding performance on the operating expense got us to where we need to be.
Last 2 comments are on the financial areas. One, as previously noted, we did put in place a bank facility at $750 million. We have no plans to immediately draw that down. And of course, that's for general corporate purposes. But if you look out as our drillships are delivered, we've got 70% payments due for those. We've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet so that, that will be the primary source of financing that, but we felt that this was something that it was prudent for us to have. The rates that we got on that were outstanding. We are the only A-rated, by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, drilling contractor in the space, and I think that was reflected in the rates that we obtained.
And then the final financial thing that I would note is we, again, declared a regular and special dividend at the same rates that have been in effect for some period of time, and this brings our cumulative payments since we began our dividend program a number of years ago at $34 a share. And so that added to the share price, for our long-term shareholders, reflects the value that we returned and puts us certainly in the top tier of offshore drilling companies' combined share performance and dividends.
So that's my summary of how I saw the quarter, and I'll let Michael talk a little bit more about where the markets are."

Today, I'l",782,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending the call.
The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll discuss each of the market segments. But in general, we are pleased with the state of the business and believe that it should remain strong going forward into 2013.
Looking at the market segments, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets continue to show strength worldwide with the concentration of incremental demand continuing to reside in Australia, West Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Several new fixtures with strong dayrates have been announced over the past 3 months, and we believe this momentum in the market will continue for the foreseeable future.
As stated in our earnings announcement, we recently signed the Ocean Endeavor to a worldwide contract with an unnamed operator for 18 months at $505,000 per day, plus a potential 6.6% bonus, up from the current operating rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, we contracted the Ocean America with Chevron, as Larry said, for 18 months in Australia at a dayrate of $475,000 per day versus the current dayrate of $405,000. And then finally, the Ocean Valiant was extended for another 2 wells at $515,000 to continue to work for Hess Offshore Equatorial Guinea.
We're quite pleased with all 3 of these fixtures and our current deepwater and ultra-deepwater portfolio going forward into 2013 and 2014. We believe we're well positioned with our 2 uncontracted new-build drillships, the Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean BlackLion, along with our new deepwater semisubmersible, the Ocean Apex, all of which are due to be delivered in 2014.
With respect to ultra-deepwater pricing, recent fixtures in the market continue to demonstrate that rates for 3-year deals are hovering around the $600,000 per day mark, with West Africa fixtures typically higher by another $20,000 to $30,000 a day. For contracts with longer-term, up to 5 years potentially, rates have been settling in the high-500s where I would expect them to remain for the near future.
Turning to deepwater, we continue to see pricing momentum that has now taken us over the $500,000 per day mark for work under a year, with longer-term contracts in the high-400s. We believe this will continue with steady deepwater demand materializing for 2014.
For example, Australia continues to move forward with our explosion programs and LNG-related development projects. West Africa exploration efforts are currently strong in countries such as Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, while significant demand for development projects are being seen in Angola, Ghana and Nigeria to name a few.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have seen a resurgence in activity in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater arenas over the past year and are now approaching pre-Macondo activity levels with expectations of continued demand, taking this up to possibly 40 rigs in 2013.
In the mid-water segment of our business, as we stated on our last call, the market continues to operate its 2 distinct segments, the very strong North Sea region and the other international and U.S. Gulf of Mexico markets that remain steady.
In the North Sea, the operators continue to see great availability, which is at a premium, and are currently planning for slots in late 2013 and 2014. For example, we're receiving significant interest in the Ocean Princess, which ends its current contract in August 2013, subject to its options, of course, with operators looking at an average of 2 years of term commitment. Additionally, we have had discussions with several operators on relocating additional existing capacity to the region with a potential for a term contract.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other international locations outside the North Sea, the market continues to be steady to slightly increasing and has produced additional demand with some pricing power. Our announcement yesterday on the Ocean Lexington and its contract with the group of BG, Centrica and Niko is a positive data point for this segment, with an increasing rate and a term commitment from the group of operators.
Our other mid-water rigs, the Saratoga, Patriot in general, continue to build short-term backlog while remaining steady from a dayrate perspective. The Ocean Ambassador, which just left Brazil to return to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a rig we are focusing on as we are discussing opportunities with operators with the intent to secure a contract in the next few months.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the direction of the market and the future strength of the offshore drilling business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
338612,217825553,366497,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax i",1533,"Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax income, or $1.45 per share.
The primary reasoning, though, for that decrease was, in the second quarter, if you recall, we sold 5 of our jack-up rigs and recorded a gain of about $50 million or after-tax EPS of $0.36 a share. So if you take that out of the mix, we actually increased our earnings quarter-over-quarter.
As Larry said, one of the reasons for that increase in earnings was our lower anticipated rig operating cost. So looking back at the guidance that we gave last quarter, I have told everyone that we expected operating cost to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million, and we actually came in at $357 million, a substantial beat. Part of that beat of the cost is a result of some timing issues. We had anticipated the Ocean Worker would undergo a survey in the fourth quarter, and that has been pushed back in its entirety to the third -- I'm sorry, we thought it was going to be in the third quarter, we pushed it back in its entirety to the fourth quarter.
Also, the Ocean Victory was supposed to perform most of its survey in Q3, and it's moved most of it back to Q4. We began the very first part of it in Q3.
If you look at those 2 things, we believe about $15 million worth of cost were pushed from Q3 into Q4. In addition to that, we had about $10 million of currency, favorable currency issues out there. We -- in our cost estimates for the quarter, we anticipated the U.S. dollar being what we were at when we budgeted for the year, and dollars have been stronger than that. So that gave us about a $10 million favorable variance.
So those 2, in total, both timing and U.S. dollars, is about $25 million. The remaining portion, though, of the beat comes from just general cost controls. We had about $7 million worth of estimate to actual adjustments during the quarter. These are items that we had anticipated cost in prior quarters and booked expenses, and they actually came in lower than what we anticipated. And therefore, we turned those accruals around in Q3 as we became comfortable of what the actual costs were. So that $7 million doesn't necessarily relate to Q3 but does relate to prior quarters where cost came in even a little bit lower than the good numbers that we reported then.
We had a number of surveys in Q3. Those surveys came in about $8 million, below our expectations. Again, just watching the dollars. We had about a $5 million adjustment on our reserve for our Jones Act's claims. This is not something that we estimate ourselves, but rather go to an outside third party actuary and have them estimate our reserves for us. And we do that on a quarterly basis, and so this quarter came back with a $5 million credit. This is a reflection, I think, of 2 things. Number one, our incident rate is in -- for safety, is the best that it's ever been, and so that's reflected in this credit. And not only is the incident rate down, but the severity of the incidents we are having is down. And so that has benefited the cost to us.
In addition to that, we had about $15 million more of what I would just term general cost savings and cost control spread throughout the fleet, much of it in our supply and maintenance expense. Again, as Larry pointed out, the guys out on the rigs that are in charge is just doing a very good job, and we're very happy with that.
Looking at some of the other lines on the income statement, our G&A costs were a little bit lower than expected. Part of this was due to about a $2.5 million accounting adjustment that we had during the quarter.
Interest expense was down by $2 million below what our expectations were. We benefited here from a favorable resolution to a tax audit that we had reserved for in our FIN 48 accrual. This has been going on for a number of years. It relates to one of our international subsidiaries that we had a favorable resolution. We were able to turn that reserve around. It only affected the tax line by about $1 million, $1.5 million, so it kind of got lost in the rounding on taxes. But we had also recorded $2.5 million worth of interest on that accrual. And since we were successful in defending ourselves there, we were able to turn that around, and that came out of our interest expense line.
A depreciation of $99 million was within our guidance, and our tax rate of 24.1% was within the guidance that I gave, which was 22% to 25%. So a little bit toward the top end of it, but still within the range that we expected.
Looking forward to the third quarter, as always, planned downtime will affect both our earnings and our cost. For the quarter, we are anticipating that the Ocean Worker will be down about 65 days for its 5-year survey. We will complete the Victory survey that was begun by 15 down days in Q3. It will have an additional 45 down days in the fourth quarter. And we expect to begin the Quest about December 1, which will result in 31 down days. So you total that up, that's about 140 days on those 3 rigs for survey.
In addition, the Ocean Saratoga is currently on a standby rate with BP. For accounting reasons, we are not recognizing any of those revenues that we've earned for the first 45 days of the quarter. Rather, what we will do is defer those earnings and amortize them over the remaining portion of the contract. So essentially, you'll have 45 days from an accounting standpoint of 0 revenue coming in, even though we are actually able to build that on an ongoing basis.
The Ambassador is, as Michael said, is mobe-ing -- or preparing to mobe back to the Gulf of Mexico. We believe it will be about down 60 days before it gets here and totally completes its mobe. And as always, I refer you to the Rig Status Report for details on these down times and exact dates and further information on it.
Getting down to specifics on cost for -- that we expect in the fourth quarter. Again, as always, our normal daily operating expense on our rigs that we gave some guidance out early on the year will occur. The cost of the surveys I talked about, we're estimating about $17 million. The Worker is a larger survey, more days, and we've got some stuff we want to do with that rig. We'll be about 10 just for that rig. So we'll have $17 million there. Amortize mobe, approximately $13 million is what we're expecting for the quarter. Again, this will be offset by mobe revenues pretty much dollar for dollar. The Ambassador's mobe back to the Gulf will extend that currently, probably about $6 million. This time, we are factoring in the strength of the U.S. dollar. So we'll be taking that into account and assuming that the dollar will stay strong. So we've reduced our expectations for that.
And then finally, during the fourth quarter, historically, we've always seen our major project expense number go up as we complete projects that we've budgeted at the beginning of the year and said historically that's always been the highest in the fourth quarter. So we've tried to build that into our numbers. You take all of that into account and we believe that contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter will be between $390 million to $410 million. As always, I would note, this is contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable cost will be in addition to the amount that I just gave you.
A few other lines. G&A, we believe that will return back to the $17 million, $18 million which we've historically recorded over the past 6 or 7 quarters. Appreciation, same guidance as last quarter, $99 million to $101 million. And interest expense, we believe, will return to its normal cost, which is the $22 million which is what our outstanding debt brings us, less $10 million worth of capitalized interest or a net of $11 million.
The effective tax rate will increase it just slightly over last time. We believe it will be somewhere between the 23% to 26% range. And finally, capital expense, we are increasing our expected capital from $720 million to $800 million, and that's to reflect the Ocean Apex rig that we announced earlier in the quarter. That $800 million will be broken down between maintenance capital of $320 million. And our new-build rigs, we expect to spend about $480 million.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

There is the weather issues, but it's a great market. And then you're right next to where Brent prices, and that premium and everything makes it really, really good. There are not that many rigs that are capable of working in the North Sea. In addition to the safety case, there's standards that have to be met.

I think that probably is the Lexington fixtures around the leading edge rate for an international mid-water rig. Of course, as Larry said, we believe we'll have some gains from an operating cost standpoint, moving that rig into the Trinidad market. It just depends on the rig capability. You've got 1,000-foot mid-water rigs and you've got 3,500-foot mid-water rigs. So that capability then trickles into the pricing advantages and opportunities. But I think the upper end of the mid-water is in the high-2s, and more your standard 1,500-foot type mid-water rigs are in the mid-2s. That's a -- it was a great contract for us. We're very excited about it. The ability to get that type of term in the mid-water segment is just not everywhere we look. It's more of short-term as you see with the Patriot, the General. You're getting 90 days, still getting 120-day jobs. So until we start seeing that term build up, I think you'll continue to see the rates where they are, and that's the reason I made my steady comment versus increasing. But where it's possible, obviously we'll take advantage of the pricing power and opportunities with the rigs we have to put them into good markets with better margin environments.

Also, when we do some of our estimates, we're trying to estimate how much it costs to mobe in and out. And it's very easy to miss those estimates by $0.5 million to $0.75 million. So again, I wish I could tell you it's A B and C equal $8 million. But when I looked at it and tried to come up with those things, it's just kind of, across the board, a lot of little things."

And that's kind of led to the Epoch coming down, a couple of rigs which are now down and available as our new capacity candidates. The Onyx and Apex were in that category. So that kind of offsets it. So it's not something that I see is a huge issue for us. And we are bringing in new rigs into the fleet, and those will require less maintenance. But on the other hand, the money that we're spending on -- we got Courage and Valor, fairly new rigs, but they go into Brazil where you have to price such high duties on anything you bring into them, and we've still been working on those. I would say those run higher maintenance CapEx then we see on some of our older rigs."

I've got 4 points I'd like to talk about in my opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to Michael Acuff to expand on the market and then Gary Krenek will walk you through the numbers in a little bit more detail.
First and most significant, I think, is the forward commitments that we announced in this press release and a recent filing of our rig status report, but primarily in this press release.
First, I'd like to comment on the Ocean America and Ocean Valiant, which are fourth-generation rigs. Ocean America, we signed up in Australia, 18-month commitment with Chevron at $475,000. I think that reflects a little bit -- though that's one of the lower rates that we have and it's a little higher cost area, it's still a solid profitable rate that we'll do very well on, but it reflects that the Pacific may be the weakest of the markets that we operate in or, I'd rather say, least strong because it's still -- it is a nice market.
Over in Africa, where the Valiant extended a short-term for Hess and moved its rate from a $300,000 up to $515,000 is, I think, reflective of a decent market, and that's a continuation of the 490,000 rate that we booked on our new capacity rig, the Ocean Onyx, in the Gulf of Mexico.
And it's important to remember that these fourth-generation rigs are moored, and they have substantially less operating cost, crews, marine crews and maintenance expenditures than you'll find on your fifth and sixth-generation rigs. So the margins that we are likely to earn on the Valiant in West Africa at this point will be very, very close to what sixth-generation rigs will be earning.
On the higher spec rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, we announced an 18-month commitment at a -- we're calling $521,000, which is $505,000 plus half of a 6.6% bonus, which is what, for budget and SEC purposes, we say that we typically earn. We never earn 100% across our fleet, but we do typically 50% or better on those. So that's a solid rate coming up from a post-Macondo rate that we've been working on in the high-200s in Egypt, and this work will be at a location outside the Mediterranean.
Then additionally, the Ocean Lexington will be released by OGX from Brazil. That's been talked about for some period of time. And we secured a greater than 12-month commitment for the rig in Trinidad with a consortium of companies at $300,000 a day. So that's about a $50,000 uptick from the price we're working in, in Brazil, and we're anticipating a very substantial reduction in cost, Brazil being our highest-cost location that we work in. And Trinidad won't be as cheap as the Gulf of Mexico, but it should be substantially cheaper. So that will be a nice profitable job for us.
And in addition to that, there's some other -- Patriot in the Pacific. And Saratoga, I believe, we announced just recently in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's really one of the few mid-water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. So that's doing very well.
On the performance for the quarter, we're very pleased with our operating expense. We've continued quarter-after-quarter to just stay very tight within our budget, and this is in spite of the fact that conditions do change on us and there are a lot of cost inflation pressures. But the people that look after our fleet just continue to do a very, very good job.
This was offset somewhat by a little bit of impact on the revenues as our unanticipated equipment downtime reached 159 days in the quarter. If you look back, last quarter, we made an all-time record of only 60 days across the fleet, but the 3 preceding quarters were in the 140s to as low as 110. So we're up from where we were there. And the downtime was concentrated on 2 fifth-generation rigs, which helped -- hurt really to get some high dayrates that we lost time on. But the rest of the fleet did very, very well and performed well under what our expectations are.
And so it wasn't as big of an impact as we would have otherwise had and having the risk of downtime on rigs due to equipment failures or maintenance or even the higher standards that the whole industry looks towards in a post-Macondo world, are continuing risks as we go forward, but we're comfortable on a rolling quarter basis that we will be able to perform within tolerance and not have that. But again, the outstanding performance on the operating expense got us to where we need to be.
Last 2 comments are on the financial areas. One, as previously noted, we did put in place a bank facility at $750 million. We have no plans to immediately draw that down. And of course, that's for general corporate purposes. But if you look out as our drillships are delivered, we've got 70% payments due for those. We've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet so that, that will be the primary source of financing that, but we felt that this was something that it was prudent for us to have. The rates that we got on that were outstanding. We are the only A-rated, by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, drilling contractor in the space, and I think that was reflected in the rates that we obtained.
And then the final financial thing that I would note is we, again, declared a regular and special dividend at the same rates that have been in effect for some period of time, and this brings our cumulative payments since we began our dividend program a number of years ago at $34 a share. And so that added to the share price, for our long-term shareholders, reflects the value that we returned and puts us certainly in the top tier of offshore drilling companies' combined share performance and dividends.
So that's my summary of how I saw the quarter, and I'll let Michael talk a little bit more about where the markets are."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending the call.The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'l",783,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending the call.
The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll discuss each of the market segments. But in general, we are pleased with the state of the business and believe that it should remain strong going forward into 2013.
Looking at the market segments, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets continue to show strength worldwide with the concentration of incremental demand continuing to reside in Australia, West Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Several new fixtures with strong dayrates have been announced over the past 3 months, and we believe this momentum in the market will continue for the foreseeable future.
As stated in our earnings announcement, we recently signed the Ocean Endeavor to a worldwide contract with an unnamed operator for 18 months at $505,000 per day, plus a potential 6.6% bonus, up from the current operating rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, we contracted the Ocean America with Chevron, as Larry said, for 18 months in Australia at a dayrate of $475,000 per day versus the current dayrate of $405,000. And then finally, the Ocean Valiant was extended for another 2 wells at $515,000 to continue its work for Hess Offshore Equatorial Guinea.
We're quite pleased with all 3 of these fixtures and our current deepwater and ultra-deepwater portfolio going forward into 2013 and 2014. We believe we're well positioned with our 2 uncontracted new-build drillships, the Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean BlackLion, along with our new deepwater semisubmersible, the Ocean Apex, all of which are due to be delivered in 2014.
With respect to ultra-deepwater pricing, recent fixtures in the market continue to demonstrate that rates for 3-year deals are hovering around the $600,000 per day mark, with West Africa fixtures typically higher by another $20,000 to $30,000 a day. For contracts with longer-term, up to 5 years potentially, rates have been settling in the high-500s where I would expect them to remain for the near future.
Turning to deepwater, we continue to see pricing momentum that has now taken us over the $500,000 per day mark for work under a year, with longer-term contracts in the high-400s. We believe this will continue with steady deepwater demand materializing for 2014.
For example, Australia continues to move forward with their exploration programs and LNG-related development projects. West Africa exploration efforts are currently strong in countries such as Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, while significant demand for development projects are being seen in Angola, Ghana and Nigeria to name a few.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have seen a resurgence in activity in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater arenas over the past year and are now approaching pre-Macondo activity levels with expectations of continued demand, taking this up to possibly 40 rigs in 2013.
In the mid-water segment of our business, as we stated on our last call, the market continues to operate its 2 distinct segments, the very strong North Sea region and the other international and U.S. Gulf of Mexico markets that remain steady.
In the North Sea, the operators continue to see great availability, which is at a premium, and are currently planning for slots in late 2013 and 2014. For example, we're receiving significant interest in the Ocean Princess, which ends its current contract in August 2013, subject to its options, of course, with operators looking at an average of 2 years of term commitment. Additionally, we have had discussions with several operators on relocating additional existing capacity to the region with a potential for a term contract.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other international locations outside the North Sea, the market continues to be steady to slightly increasing and has produced additional demand with some pricing power. Our announcement yesterday on the Ocean Lexington and its contract with the group of BG, Centrica and Niko is a positive data point for this segment, with an increase in rate and a term commitment from the group of operators.
Our other mid-water rigs, the Saratoga, Patriot in general, continue to build short-term backlog while remaining steady from a dayrate perspective. The Ocean Ambassador, which just left Brazil to return to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a rig we are focusing on as we are discussing opportunities with operators with the intent to secure a contract in the next few months.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the direction of the market and the future strength of the offshore drilling business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
338612,217825553,366563,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax i",1535,"Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax income, or $1.45 per share.
The primary reason, though, for that decrease was, in the second quarter, if you recall, we sold 5 of our jack-up rigs and recorded a gain of about $50 million or after-tax EPS of $0.36 a share. So if you take that out of the mix, we actually increased our earnings quarter-over-quarter.
As Larry said, one of the reasons for that increase in earnings was our lower anticipated rig operating cost. So looking back at the guidance that we gave last quarter, I had told everyone that we expected operating cost to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million, and we actually came in at $357 million, a substantial beat. Part of that beat of the cost is a result of some timing issues. We had anticipated the Ocean Worker would undergo a survey in the fourth quarter, and that has been pushed back in its entirety to the third -- I'm sorry, we thought it was going to be in the third quarter, we pushed it back in its entirety to the fourth quarter.
Also, the Ocean Victory was supposed to perform most of its survey in Q3, and it's moved most of it back to Q4. We began the very first part of it in Q3.
If you look at those 2 things, we believe about $15 million worth of cost were pushed from Q3 into Q4. In addition to that, we had about $10 million of currency, favorable currency issues out there. We -- in our cost estimates for the quarter, we anticipated the U.S. dollar being what we were at when we budgeted for the year, and dollars have been stronger than that. So that gave us about a $10 million favorable variance.
So those 2, in total, both timing and U.S. dollars, is about $25 million. The remaining portion, though, of the beat comes from just general cost controls. We had about $7 million worth of estimate to actual adjustments during the quarter. These are items that we had anticipated cost in prior quarters and booked expenses, and they actually came in lower than what we anticipated. And therefore, we turned those accruals around in Q3 as we became comfortable of what the actual costs were. So that $7 million doesn't necessarily relate to Q3 but does relate to prior quarters where cost came in even a little bit lower than the good numbers that we reported then.
We had a number of surveys in Q3. Those surveys came in about $8 million, below our expectations. Again, just watching the dollars. We had about a $5 million adjustment on our reserve for our Jones Act's claims. This is not something that we estimate ourselves, but rather go to an outside third party actuary and have them estimate our reserves for us. And we do that on a quarterly basis, and so this quarter came back with a $5 million credit. This is a reflection, I think, of 2 things. Number one, our incident rate is in -- for safety, is the best that it's ever been, and so that's reflected in this credit. And not only is the incident rate down, but the severity of the incidents we are having is down. And so that has benefited the cost to us.
In addition to that, we had about $15 million more of what I would just term general cost savings and cost control spread throughout the fleet, much of it in our supply and maintenance expense. Again, as Larry pointed out, the guys out on the rigs that are in charge of this just doing a very good job, and we're very happy with that.
Looking at some of the other lines on the income statement, our G&A costs were a little bit lower than expected. Part of this was due to about a $2.5 million accounting adjustment that we had during the quarter.
Interest expense was down by $2 million below what our expectations were. We benefited here from a favorable resolution to a tax audit that we had reserved for in our FIN 48 accrual. This has been going on for a number of years. It relates to one of our international subsidiaries that -- and we had a favorable resolution. We were able to turn that reserve around. It only affected the tax line by about $1 million, $1.5 million, so it kind of got lost in the rounding on taxes. But we had also recorded $2.5 million worth of interest on that accrual. And since we were successful in defending ourselves there, we were able to turn that around, and that came out of our interest expense line.
Depreciation of $99 million was within our guidance, and our tax rate of 24.1% was within the guidance that I gave, which was 22% to 25%. So a little bit toward the top end of it, but still within the range that we expected.
Looking forward to the third quarter, as always, planned downtime will affect both our earnings and our cost. For the quarter, we are anticipating that the Ocean Worker will be down about 65 days for its 5-year survey. We will complete the Victory survey that was begun by 15 down days in Q3. It will have an additional 45 down days in the fourth quarter. And we expect to begin the Quest about December 1, which will result in 31 down days. So you total that up, that's about 140 days on those 3 rigs for survey.
In addition, the Ocean Saratoga is currently on a standby rate with BP. For accounting reasons, we are not recognizing any of those revenues that we've earned for the first 45 days of the quarter. Rather, what we will do is defer those earnings and amortize them over the remaining portion of the contract. So essentially, you'll have 45 days from an accounting standpoint of 0 revenue coming in, even though we are actually able to bill that on an ongoing basis.
The Ambassador is, as Michael said, is mobe-ing -- or preparing to mobe back to the Gulf of Mexico. We believe it will be about down 60 days before it gets here and totally completes its mobe. And as always, I refer you to the Rig Status Report for details on these down times and exact dates and further information on it.
Getting down to specifics on cost for -- that we expect in the fourth quarter. Again, as always, our normal daily operating expense on our rigs that we gave some guidance out early on the year will occur. The cost of the surveys I talked about, we're estimating about $17 million. The Worker is a larger survey, more days, and we've got some stuff we want to do with that rig, will be about 10 just for that rig. So we'll have $17 million there. Amortize mobe, approximately $13 million is what we're expecting for the quarter. Again, this will be offset by mobe revenues pretty much dollar for dollar. The Ambassador's mobe back to the Gulf will expense that currently, probably about $6 million. This time, we are factoring in the strength of the U.S. dollar. So we'll be taking that into account and assuming that the dollar will stay strong. So we've reduced our expectations for that.
And then finally, during the fourth quarter, historically, we've always seen our major project expense number go up as we complete projects that we've budgeted at the beginning of the year and said historically that's always been the highest in the fourth quarter. So we've tried to build that into our numbers. You take all of that into account and we believe that contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter will be between $390 million to $410 million. As always, I would note, this is contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable cost will be in addition to the amount that I just gave you.
A few other lines. G&A, we believe that will return back to the $17 million, $18 million which we've historically recorded over the past 6 or 7 quarters. Depreciation, same guidance as last quarter, $99 million to $101 million. And interest expense, we believe, will return to its normal cost, which is the $22 million which is what our outstanding debt brings us, less $10 million worth of capitalized interest or a net of $11 million.
The effective tax rate will increase it just slightly over last time. We believe it will be somewhere between the 23% to 26% range. And finally, capital expense, we are increasing our expected capital from $720 million to $800 million, and that's to reflect the Ocean Apex rig that we announced earlier in the quarter. That $800 million will be broken down between maintenance capital of $320 million. And our new-build rigs, we expect to spend about $480 million.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

And we took 7, 8 days, I believe, of downtime. So there wasn't a huge amount of downtime that resulted on the Confidence. And because we had a backup commitment from Murphy in the initial pop [ph] hole section, we were confident that the DP system was robust enough, as long as we -- up until the point that we had to run the stack, everybody was comfortable on that.

I think that probably is the Lexington fixtures around the leading edge rate for an international mid-water rig. Of course, as Larry said, we believe we'll have some gains from an operating cost standpoint, moving that rig into the Trinidad market. It just depends on the rig capability. You've got 1,000-foot mid-water rigs and you've got 3,500-foot mid-water rigs. So that capability then trickles into the pricing advantages and opportunities. But I think the upper end of the mid-water is in the high-2s, and more your standard 1,500-foot type mid-water rigs are in the mid-2s. That's a -- it was a great contract for us. We're very excited about it. The ability to get that type of term in the mid-water segment is just not everywhere we look. It's more of short-term as you see with the Patriot, the General. You're getting 90 days, still getting 120-day jobs. So until we start seeing that term build up, I think you'll continue to see the rates where they are, and that's the reason I made my steady comment versus increasing. But where it's possible, obviously we'll take advantage of the pricing power and opportunities with the rigs we have to put them into good markets with better margin environments. So we're quite excited about the Lexington."

And then the second question, what that -- reducing cost in this quarter. Nothing that I can put my finger on. Part of it is just being a little bit more efficient, not being in the shipyard quite as long. If we can save 2 or 3 days, that can save a lot of money for us. Also, when we do some of our estimates, we're trying to estimate how much it costs to mobe in and out. And it's very easy to miss those estimates by $0.5 million to $0.75 million.

I've got 4 points I'd like to talk about in my opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to Michael Acuff to expand on the market and then Gary Krenek will walk you through the numbers in a little bit more detail.
First and most significant, I think, is the forward commitments that we announced in this press release and a recent filing of our rig status report, but primarily in this press release.
First, I'd like to comment on the Ocean America and Ocean Valiant, which are fourth-generation rigs. Ocean America, we signed up in Australia, 18-month commitment with Chevron at $475,000. I think that reflects a little bit -- though that's one of the lower rates that we have and it's a little higher cost area, it's still a solid profitable rate that we'll do very well on, but it reflects that the Pacific may be the weakest of the markets that we operate in or, I'd rather say, least strong because it's still -- it is a nice market.
Over in Africa, where the Valiant extended a short-term for Hess and moved its rate from a $300,000 up to $515,000 is, I think, reflective of a decent market, and that's a continuation of the 490,000 rate that we booked on our new capacity rig, the Ocean Onyx, in the Gulf of Mexico.
And it's important to remember that these fourth-generation rigs are moored, and they have substantially less operating cost, crews, marine crews and maintenance expenditures than you'll find on your fifth and sixth-generation rigs. So the margins that we are likely to earn on the Valiant in West Africa at this point will be very, very close to what sixth-generation rigs will be earning.
On the higher spec rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, we announced an 18-month commitment at a -- we're calling $521,000, which is $505,000 plus half of a 6.6% bonus, which is what, for budget and SEC purposes, we say that we typically earn. We never earn 100% across our fleet, but we do typically 50% or better on those. So that's a solid rate coming up from a post-Macondo rate that we've been working on in the high-200s in Egypt, and this work will be at a location outside the Mediterranean.
Then additionally, the Ocean Lexington will be released by OGX from Brazil. That's been talked about for some period of time. And we secured a greater than 12-month commitment for the rig in Trinidad with a consortium of companies at $300,000 a day. So that's about a $50,000 uptick from the price we're working in, in Brazil, and we're anticipating a very substantial reduction in cost, Brazil being our highest-cost location that we work in. And Trinidad won't be as cheap as the Gulf of Mexico, but it should be substantially cheaper. So that will be a nice profitable job for us.
And in addition to that, there's some other -- Patriot in the Pacific. And Saratoga, I believe, we announced just recently in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's really one of the few mid-water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. So that's doing very well.
On the performance for the quarter, we're very pleased with our operating expense. We've continued quarter-after-quarter to just stay very tight within our budget, and this is in spite of the fact that conditions do change on us and there are a lot of cost inflation pressures. But the people that look after our fleet just continue to do a very, very good job.
This was offset somewhat by a little bit of impact on the revenues as our unanticipated equipment downtime reached 159 days in the quarter. If you look back, last quarter, we made an all-time record of only 60 days across the fleet, but the 3 preceding quarters were in the 140s to as low as 110. So we're up from where we were there. And the downtime was concentrated on 2 fifth-generation rigs, which helped -- hurt really to get some high dayrates that we lost time on. But the rest of the fleet did very, very well and performed well under what our expectations are.
And so it wasn't as big of an impact as we would have otherwise had. And having the risk of downtime on rigs due to equipment failures or maintenance or even the higher standards that the whole industry looks towards in a post-Macondo world are continuing risks as we go forward, but we're comfortable on a rolling quarter basis that we will be able to perform within tolerance and not have that. But again, the outstanding performance on the operating expense got us to where we need to be.
Last 2 comments are on the financial areas. One, as previously noted, we did put in place a bank facility at $750 million. We have no plans to immediately draw that down. And of course, that's for general corporate purposes. But if you look out as our drillships are delivered, we've got 70% payments due for those. We've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet so that, that will be the primary source of financing that, but we felt that this was something that it was prudent for us to have. The rates that we got on that were outstanding. We are the only A-rated, by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, drilling contractor in the space, and I think that was reflected in the rates that we obtained.
And then the final financial thing that I would note is we, again, declared a regular and special dividend at the same rates that have been in effect for some period of time, and this brings our cumulative payments since we began our dividend program a number of years ago at $34 a share. And so that added to the share price, for our long-term shareholders, reflects the value that we returned and puts us certainly in the top tier of offshore drilling companies' combined share performance and dividends.
So that's my summary of how I saw the quarter, and I'll let Michael talk a little bit more about where the markets are."

Today, I'l",783,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending the call.
The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll discuss each of the market segments. But in general, we are pleased with the state of the business and believe that it should remain strong going forward into 2013.
Looking at the market segments, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets continue to show strength worldwide with the concentration of incremental demand continuing to reside in Australia, West Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Several new fixtures with strong dayrates have been announced over the past 3 months, and we believe this momentum in the market will continue for the foreseeable future.
As stated in our earnings announcement, we recently signed the Ocean Endeavor to a worldwide contract with an unnamed operator for 18 months at $505,000 per day, plus a potential 6.6% bonus, up from the current operating rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, we contracted the Ocean America with Chevron, as Larry said, for 18 months in Australia at a dayrate of $475,000 per day versus the current dayrate of $405,000. And then finally, the Ocean Valiant was extended for another 2 wells at $515,000 to continue its work for Hess Offshore Equatorial Guinea.
We're quite pleased with all 3 of these fixtures and our current deepwater and ultra-deepwater portfolio going forward into 2013 and 2014. We believe we're well positioned with our 2 uncontracted new-build drillships, the Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean BlackLion, along with our new deepwater semisubmersible, the Ocean Apex, all of which are due to be delivered in 2014.
With respect to ultra-deepwater pricing, recent fixtures in the market continue to demonstrate that rates for 3-year deals are hovering around the $600,000 per day mark, with West Africa fixtures typically higher by another $20,000 to $30,000 a day. For contracts with longer-term, up to 5 years potentially, rates have been settling in the high-500s where I would expect them to remain for the near future.
Turning to deepwater, we continue to see pricing momentum that has now taken us over the $500,000 per day mark for work under a year, with longer-term contracts in the high-400s. We believe this will continue with steady deepwater demand materializing for 2014.
For example, Australia continues to move forward with their exploration programs and LNG-related development projects. West Africa exploration efforts are currently strong in countries such as Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, while significant demand for development projects are being seen in Angola, Ghana and Nigeria to name a few.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have seen a resurgence in activity in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater arenas over the past year and are now approaching pre-Macondo activity levels with expectations of continued demand, taking this up to possibly 40 rigs in 2013.
In the mid-water segment of our business, as we stated on our last call, the market continues to operate its 2 distinct segments, the very strong North Sea region and the other international and U.S. Gulf of Mexico markets that remain steady.
In the North Sea, the operators continue to see great availability, which is at a premium, and are currently planning for slots in late 2013 and 2014. For example, we're receiving significant interest in the Ocean Princess, which ends its current contract in August 2013, subject to its options, of course, with operators looking at an average of 2 years of term commitment. Additionally, we have had discussions with several operators on relocating additional existing capacity to the region with a potential for a term contract.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other international locations outside the North Sea, the market continues to be steady to slightly increasing and has produced additional demand with some pricing power. Our announcement yesterday on the Ocean Lexington and its contract with the group of BG, Centrica and Niko is a positive data point for this segment, with an increase in rate and a term commitment from the group of operators.
Our other mid-water rigs, the Saratoga, Patriot in general, continue to build short-term backlog while remaining steady from a dayrate perspective. The Ocean Ambassador, which just left Brazil to return to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a rig we are focusing on as we are discussing opportunities with operators with the intent to secure a contract in the next few months.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the direction of the market and the future strength of the offshore drilling business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
338612,217825553,366834,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax i",1535,"Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax income, or $1.45 per share.
The primary reason, though, for that decrease was, in the second quarter, if you recall, we sold 5 of our jack-up rigs and recorded a gain of about $50 million or after-tax EPS of $0.36 a share. So if you take that out of the mix, we actually increased our earnings quarter-over-quarter.
As Larry said, one of the reasons for that increase in earnings was our lower anticipated rig operating cost. So looking back at the guidance that we gave last quarter, I had told everyone that we expected operating cost to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million, and we actually came in at $357 million, a substantial beat. Part of that beat of the cost is a result of some timing issues. We had anticipated the Ocean Worker would undergo a survey in the fourth quarter, and that has been pushed back in its entirety to the third -- I'm sorry, we thought it was going to be in the third quarter, we pushed it back in its entirety to the fourth quarter.
Also, the Ocean Victory was supposed to perform most of its survey in Q3, and it's moved most of it back to Q4. We began the very first part of it in Q3.
If you look at those 2 things, we believe about $15 million worth of cost were pushed from Q3 into Q4. In addition to that, we had about $10 million of currency, favorable currency issues out there. We -- in our cost estimates for the quarter, we anticipated the U.S. dollar being what we were at when we budgeted for the year, and dollars have been stronger than that. So that gave us about a $10 million favorable variance.
So those 2, in total, both timing and U.S. dollars, is about $25 million. The remaining portion, though, of the beat comes from just general cost controls. We had about $7 million worth of estimate to actual adjustments during the quarter. These are items that we had anticipated cost in prior quarters and booked expenses, and they actually came in lower than what we anticipated. And therefore, we turned those accruals around in Q3 as we became comfortable of what the actual costs were. So that $7 million doesn't necessarily relate to Q3 but does relate to prior quarters where cost came in even a little bit lower than the good numbers that we reported then.
We had a number of surveys in Q3. Those surveys came in about $8 million, below our expectations. Again, just watching the dollars. We had about a $5 million adjustment on our reserve for our Jones Act's claims. This is not something that we estimate ourselves, but rather go to an outside third party actuary and have them estimate our reserves for us. And we do that on a quarterly basis, and so this quarter came back with a $5 million credit. This is a reflection, I think, of 2 things. Number one, our incident rate is in -- for safety, is the best that it's ever been, and so that's reflected in this credit. And not only is the incident rate down, but the severity of the incidents we are having is down. And so that has benefited the cost to us.
In addition to that, we had about $15 million more of what I would just term general cost savings and cost control spread throughout the fleet, much of it in our supply and maintenance expense. Again, as Larry pointed out, the guys out on the rigs that are in charge of this just doing a very good job, and we're very happy with that.
Looking at some of the other lines on the income statement, our G&A costs were a little bit lower than expected. Part of this was due to about a $2.5 million accounting adjustment that we had during the quarter.
Interest expense was down by $2 million below what our expectations were. We benefited here from a favorable resolution to a tax audit that we had reserved for in our FIN 48 accrual. This has been going on for a number of years. It relates to one of our international subsidiaries that -- and we had a favorable resolution. We were able to turn that reserve around. It only affected the tax line by about $1 million, $1.5 million, so it kind of got lost in the rounding on taxes. But we had also recorded $2.5 million worth of interest on that accrual. And since we were successful in defending ourselves there, we were able to turn that around, and that came out of our interest expense line.
Depreciation of $99 million was within our guidance, and our tax rate of 24.1% was within the guidance that I gave, which was 22% to 25%. So a little bit toward the top end of it, but still within the range that we expected.
Looking forward to the third quarter, as always, planned downtime will affect both our earnings and our cost. For the quarter, we are anticipating that the Ocean Worker will be down about 65 days for its 5-year survey. We will complete the Victory survey that was begun by 15 down days in Q3. It will have an additional 45 down days in the fourth quarter. And we expect to begin the Quest about December 1, which will result in 31 down days. So you total that up, that's about 140 days on those 3 rigs for survey.
In addition, the Ocean Saratoga is currently on a standby rate with BP. For accounting reasons, we are not recognizing any of those revenues that we've earned for the first 45 days of the quarter. Rather, what we will do is defer those earnings and amortize them over the remaining portion of the contract. So essentially, you'll have 45 days from an accounting standpoint of 0 revenue coming in, even though we are actually able to bill that on an ongoing basis.
The Ambassador is, as Michael said, is mobe-ing -- or preparing to mobe back to the Gulf of Mexico. We believe it will be about down 60 days before it gets here and totally completes its mobe. And as always, I refer you to the Rig Status Report for details on these down times and exact dates and further information on it.
Getting down to specifics on cost for -- that we expect in the fourth quarter. Again, as always, our normal daily operating expense on our rigs that we gave some guidance out early on the year will occur. The cost of the surveys I talked about, we're estimating about $17 million. The Worker is a larger survey, more days, and we've got some stuff we want to do with that rig, will be about 10 just for that rig. So we'll have $17 million there. Amortize mobe, approximately $13 million is what we're expecting for the quarter. Again, this will be offset by mobe revenues pretty much dollar for dollar. The Ambassador's mobe back to the Gulf will expense that currently, probably about $6 million. This time, we are factoring in the strength of the U.S. dollar. So we'll be taking that into account and assuming that the dollar will stay strong. So we've reduced our expectations for that.
And then finally, during the fourth quarter, historically, we've always seen our major project expense number go up as we complete projects that we've budgeted at the beginning of the year and said historically that's always been the highest in the fourth quarter. So we've tried to build that into our numbers. You take all of that into account and we believe that contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter will be between $390 million to $410 million. As always, I would note, this is contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable cost will be in addition to the amount that I just gave you.
A few other lines. G&A, we believe that will return back to the $17 million, $18 million which we've historically recorded over the past 6 or 7 quarters. Depreciation, same guidance as last quarter, $99 million to $101 million. And interest expense, we believe, will return to its normal cost, which is the $22 million which is what our outstanding debt brings us, less $10 million worth of capitalized interest or a net of $11 million.
The effective tax rate will increase it just slightly over last time. We believe it will be somewhere between the 23% to 26% range. And finally, capital expense, we are increasing our expected capital from $720 million to $800 million, and that's to reflect the Ocean Apex rig that we announced earlier in the quarter. That $800 million will be broken down between maintenance capital of $320 million. And our new-build rigs, we expect to spend about $480 million.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

There is the weather issues, but it's a great market. And then you're right next to where Brent prices, and that premium and everything makes it really, really good. There are not that many rigs that are capable of working in the North Sea. In addition to the safety case, there's standards that have to be met.

The problem that we had was a computer system that controls the DP system, and it was compounded by the manufacturer is no longer really in the drilling business, and they had some concerns about potential liability in a post-Macondo world. And so we had difficulty even fixing what we needed to get fixed. And that was the situation, in our judgment, that led to Cobalt, at least from us deciding to suspend operations. And we took 7, 8 days, I believe, of downtime. So there wasn't a huge amount of downtime that resulted on the Confidence. And because we had a backup commitment from Murphy in the initial pop [ph] hole section, we were confident that the DP system was robust enough, as long as we -- up until the point that we had to run the stack, everybody was comfortable on that. And that gave us a little bit more time.

I think that probably is the Lexington fixtures around the leading edge rate for an international mid-water rig. Of course, as Larry said, we believe we'll have some gains from an operating cost standpoint, moving that rig into the Trinidad market. It just depends on the rig capability. You've got 1,000-foot mid-water rigs and you've got 3,500-foot mid-water rigs. So that capability then trickles into the pricing advantages and opportunities. But I think the upper end of the mid-water is in the high-2s, and more your standard 1,500-foot type mid-water rigs are in the mid-2s. That's a -- it was a great contract for us. We're very excited about it. The ability to get that type of term in the mid-water segment is just not everywhere we look. It's more of short-term as you see with the Patriot, the General. You're getting 90 days, still getting 120-day jobs. So until we start seeing that term build up, I think you'll continue to see the rates where they are, and that's the reason I made my steady comment versus increasing.

We're going to do about the same number of surveys. So we certainly will have a better guess for you and better estimates in our next quarterly conference call. And then the second question, what that -- reducing cost in this quarter. Nothing that I can put my finger on. Part of it is just being a little bit more efficient, not being in the shipyard quite as long. If we can save 2 or 3 days, that can save a lot of money for us. Also, when we do some of our estimates, we're trying to estimate how much it costs to mobe in and out. And it's very easy to miss those estimates by $0.5 million to $0.75 million. So again, I wish I could tell you it's A, B and C equal $8 million. But when I looked at it and tried to come up with those things, it's just kind of, across the board, a lot of little things."

So that kind of offsets it. So it's not something that I see is a huge issue for us. And we are bringing in new rigs into the fleet, and those will require less maintenance. But on the other hand, the money that we're spending on -- we got Courage and Valor, fairly new rigs, but they go into Brazil where you have to pay such high duties on anything you bring into them, and we've still been working on those.

I've got 4 points I'd like to talk about in my opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to Michael Acuff to expand on the market and then Gary Krenek will walk you through the numbers in a little bit more detail.
First and most significant, I think, is the forward commitments that we announced in this press release and a recent filing of our rig status report, but primarily in this press release.
First, I'd like to comment on the Ocean America and Ocean Valiant, which are fourth-generation rigs. Ocean America, we signed up in Australia, 18-month commitment with Chevron at $475,000. I think that reflects a little bit -- though that's one of the lower rates that we have and it's a little higher cost area, it's still a solid profitable rate that we'll do very well on, but it reflects that the Pacific may be the weakest of the markets that we operate in or, I'd rather say, least strong because it's still -- it is a nice market.
Over in Africa, where the Valiant extended a short-term for Hess and moved its rate from a $300,000 up to $515,000 is, I think, reflective of a decent market, and that's a continuation of the 490,000 rate that we booked on our new capacity rig, the Ocean Onyx, in the Gulf of Mexico.
And it's important to remember that these fourth-generation rigs are moored, and they have substantially less operating cost, crews, marine crews and maintenance expenditures than you'll find on your fifth and sixth-generation rigs. So the margins that we are likely to earn on the Valiant in West Africa at this point will be very, very close to what sixth-generation rigs will be earning.
On the higher spec rigs, the Ocean Endeavor, we announced an 18-month commitment at a -- we're calling $521,000, which is $505,000 plus half of a 6.6% bonus, which is what, for budget and SEC purposes, we say that we typically earn. We never earn 100% across our fleet, but we do typically 50% or better on those. So that's a solid rate coming up from a post-Macondo rate that we've been working on in the high-200s in Egypt, and this work will be at a location outside the Mediterranean.
Then additionally, the Ocean Lexington will be released by OGX from Brazil. That's been talked about for some period of time. And we secured a greater than 12-month commitment for the rig in Trinidad with a consortium of companies at $300,000 a day. So that's about a $50,000 uptick from the price we're working in, in Brazil, and we're anticipating a very substantial reduction in cost, Brazil being our highest-cost location that we work in. And Trinidad won't be as cheap as the Gulf of Mexico, but it should be substantially cheaper. So that will be a nice profitable job for us.
And in addition to that, there's some other -- Patriot in the Pacific. And Saratoga, I believe, we announced just recently in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's really one of the few mid-water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. So that's doing very well.
On the performance for the quarter, we're very pleased with our operating expense. We've continued quarter-after-quarter to just stay very tight within our budget, and this is in spite of the fact that conditions do change on us and there are a lot of cost inflation pressures. But the people that look after our fleet just continue to do a very, very good job.
This was offset somewhat by a little bit of impact on the revenues as our unanticipated equipment downtime reached 159 days in the quarter. If you look back, last quarter, we made an all-time record of only 60 days across the fleet, but the 3 preceding quarters were in the 140s to as low as 110. So we're up from where we were there. And the downtime was concentrated on 2 fifth-generation rigs, which helped -- hurt really to get some high dayrates that we lost time on. But the rest of the fleet did very, very well and performed well under what our expectations are.
And so it wasn't as big of an impact as we would have otherwise had. And having the risk of downtime on rigs due to equipment failures or maintenance or even the higher standards that the whole industry looks towards in a post-Macondo world are continuing risks as we go forward, but we're comfortable on a rolling quarter basis that we will be able to perform within tolerance and not have that. But again, the outstanding performance on the operating expense got us to where we need to be.
Last 2 comments are on the financial areas. One, as previously noted, we did put in place a bank facility at $750 million. We have no plans to immediately draw that down. And of course, that's for general corporate purposes. But if you look out as our drillships are delivered, we've got 70% payments due for those. We've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet so that, that will be the primary source of financing that, but we felt that this was something that it was prudent for us to have. The rates that we got on that were outstanding. We are the only A-rated, by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, drilling contractor in the space, and I think that was reflected in the rates that we obtained.
And then the final financial thing that I would note is we, again, declared a regular and special dividend at the same rates that have been in effect for some period of time, and this brings our cumulative payments since we began our dividend program a number of years ago at $34 a share. And so that added to the share price, for our long-term shareholders, reflects the value that we returned and puts us certainly in the top tier of offshore drilling companies' combined share performance and dividends.
So that's my summary of how I saw the quarter, and I'll let Michael talk a little bit more about where the markets are."

The offshore drilling market remains robust as we continue to see steady to increasing activity as a result of the strong commodity pricing in the world market today. Today, I'll discuss each of the market segments. But in general, we are pleased with the state of the business and believe that it should remain strong going forward into 2013.
Looking at the market segments, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets continue to show strength worldwide with the concentration of incremental demand continuing to reside in Australia, West Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Several new fixtures with strong dayrates have been announced over the past 3 months, and we believe this momentum in the market will continue for the foreseeable future.
As stated in our earnings announcement, we recently signed the Ocean Endeavor to a worldwide contract with an unnamed operator for 18 months at $505,000 per day, plus a potential 6.6% bonus, up from the current operating rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, we contracted the Ocean America with Chevron, as Larry said, for 18 months in Australia at a dayrate of $475,000 per day versus the current dayrate of $405,000. And then finally, the Ocean Valiant was extended for another 2 wells at $515,000 to continue its work for Hess Offshore Equatorial Guinea.
We're quite pleased with all 3 of these fixtures and our current deepwater and ultra-deepwater portfolio going forward into 2013 and 2014. We believe we're well positioned with our 2 uncontracted new-build drillships, the Ocean BlackRhino and the Ocean BlackLion, along with our new deepwater semisubmersible, the Ocean Apex, all of which are due to be delivered in 2014.
With respect to ultra-deepwater pricing, recent fixtures in the market continue to demonstrate that rates for 3-year deals are hovering around the $600,000 per day mark, with West Africa fixtures typically higher by another $20,000 to $30,000 a day. For contracts with longer-term, up to 5 years potentially, rates have been settling in the high-500s where I would expect them to remain for the near future.
Turning to deepwater, we continue to see pricing momentum that has now taken us over the $500,000 per day mark for work under a year, with longer-term contracts in the high-400s. We believe this will continue with steady deepwater demand materializing for 2014.
For example, Australia continues to move forward with their exploration programs and LNG-related development projects. West Africa exploration efforts are currently strong in countries such as Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, while significant demand for development projects are being seen in Angola, Ghana and Nigeria to name a few.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have seen a resurgence in activity in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater arenas over the past year and are now approaching pre-Macondo activity levels with expectations of continued demand, taking this up to possibly 40 rigs in 2013.
In the mid-water segment of our business, as we stated on our last call, the market continues to operate its 2 distinct segments, the very strong North Sea region and the other international and U.S. Gulf of Mexico markets that remain steady.
In the North Sea, the operators continue to see great availability, which is at a premium, and are currently planning for slots in late 2013 and 2014. For example, we're receiving significant interest in the Ocean Princess, which ends its current contract in August 2013, subject to its options, of course, with operators looking at an average of 2 years of term commitment. Additionally, we have had discussions with several operators on relocating additional existing capacity to the region with a potential for a term contract.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other international locations outside the North Sea, the market continues to be steady to slightly increasing and has produced additional demand with some pricing power. Our announcement yesterday on the Ocean Lexington and its contract with the group of BG, Centrica and Niko is a positive data point for this segment, with an increase in rate and a term commitment from the group of operators.
Our other mid-water rigs, the Saratoga, Patriot in general, continue to build short-term backlog while remaining steady from a dayrate perspective. The Ocean Ambassador, which just left Brazil to return to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a rig we are focusing on as we are discussing opportunities with operators with the intent to secure a contract in the next few months.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the direction of the market and the future strength of the offshore drilling business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary."
338612,217825553,366836,"Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax i",1535,"Thanks, Michael. For the quarter, Diamond offshore recorded a bottom line net income of $178 million, or $1.28 per share, on contract drilling revenues of $714 million. This is down from our second quarter results when we reported $201 million after-tax income, or $1.45 per share.
The primary reason, though, for that decrease was, in the second quarter, if you recall, we sold 5 of our jack-up rigs and recorded a gain of about $50 million or after-tax EPS of $0.36 a share. So if you take that out of the mix, we actually increased our earnings quarter-over-quarter.
As Larry said, one of the reasons for that increase in earnings was our lower anticipated rig operating cost. So looking back at the guidance that we gave last quarter, I had told everyone that we expected operating cost to be somewhere between $410 million to $425 million, and we actually came in at $357 million, a substantial beat. Part of that beat of the cost is a result of some timing issues. We had anticipated the Ocean Worker would undergo a survey in the fourth quarter, and that has been pushed back in its entirety to the third -- I'm sorry, we thought it was going to be in the third quarter, we pushed it back in its entirety to the fourth quarter.
Also, the Ocean Victory was supposed to perform most of its survey in Q3, and it's moved most of it back to Q4. We began the very first part of it in Q3.
If you look at those 2 things, we believe about $15 million worth of cost were pushed from Q3 into Q4. In addition to that, we had about $10 million of currency, favorable currency issues out there. We -- in our cost estimates for the quarter, we anticipated the U.S. dollar being what we were at when we budgeted for the year, and dollars have been stronger than that. So that gave us about a $10 million favorable variance.
So those 2, in total, both timing and U.S. dollars, is about $25 million. The remaining portion, though, of the beat comes from just general cost controls. We had about $7 million worth of estimate to actual adjustments during the quarter. These are items that we had anticipated cost in prior quarters and booked expenses, and they actually came in lower than what we anticipated. And therefore, we turned those accruals around in Q3 as we became comfortable of what the actual costs were. So that $7 million doesn't necessarily relate to Q3 but does relate to prior quarters where cost came in even a little bit lower than the good numbers that we reported then.
We had a number of surveys in Q3. Those surveys came in about $8 million, below our expectations. Again, just watching the dollars. We had about a $5 million adjustment on our reserve for our Jones Act's claims. This is not something that we estimate ourselves, but rather go to an outside third party actuary and have them estimate our reserves for us. And we do that on a quarterly basis, and so this quarter came back with a $5 million credit. This is a reflection, I think, of 2 things. Number one, our incident rate is in -- for safety, is the best that it's ever been, and so that's reflected in this credit. And not only is the incident rate down, but the severity of the incidents we are having is down. And so that has benefited the cost to us.
In addition to that, we had about $15 million more of what I would just term general cost savings and cost control spread throughout the fleet, much of it in our supply and maintenance expense. Again, as Larry pointed out, the guys out on the rigs that are in charge of this just doing a very good job, and we're very happy with that.
Looking at some of the other lines on the income statement, our G&A costs were a little bit lower than expected. Part of this was due to about a $2.5 million accounting adjustment that we had during the quarter.
Interest expense was down by $2 million below what our expectations were. We benefited here from a favorable resolution to a tax audit that we had reserved for in our FIN 48 accrual. This has been going on for a number of years. It relates to one of our international subsidiaries that -- and we had a favorable resolution. We were able to turn that reserve around. It only affected the tax line by about $1 million, $1.5 million, so it kind of got lost in the rounding on taxes. But we had also recorded $2.5 million worth of interest on that accrual. And since we were successful in defending ourselves there, we were able to turn that around, and that came out of our interest expense line.
Depreciation of $99 million was within our guidance, and our tax rate of 24.1% was within the guidance that I gave, which was 22% to 25%. So a little bit toward the top end of it, but still within the range that we expected.
Looking forward to the third quarter, as always, planned downtime will affect both our earnings and our cost. For the quarter, we are anticipating that the Ocean Worker will be down about 65 days for its 5-year survey. We will complete the Victory survey that was begun by 15 down days in Q3. It will have an additional 45 down days in the fourth quarter. And we expect to begin the Quest about December 1, which will result in 31 down days. So you total that up, that's about 140 days on those 3 rigs for survey.
In addition, the Ocean Saratoga is currently on a standby rate with BP. For accounting reasons, we are not recognizing any of those revenues that we've earned for the first 45 days of the quarter. Rather, what we will do is defer those earnings and amortize them over the remaining portion of the contract. So essentially, you'll have 45 days from an accounting standpoint of 0 revenue coming in, even though we are actually able to bill that on an ongoing basis.
The Ambassador is, as Michael said, is mobe-ing -- or preparing to mobe back to the Gulf of Mexico. We believe it will be about down 60 days before it gets here and totally completes its mobe. And as always, I refer you to the Rig Status Report for details on these down times and exact dates and further information on it.
Getting down to specifics on cost for -- that we expect in the fourth quarter. Again, as always, our normal daily operating expense on our rigs that we gave some guidance out early on the year will occur. The cost of the surveys I talked about, we're estimating about $17 million. The Worker is a larger survey, more days, and we've got some stuff we want to do with that rig, will be about 10 just for that rig. So we'll have $17 million there. Amortize mobe, approximately $13 million is what we're expecting for the quarter. Again, this will be offset by mobe revenues pretty much dollar for dollar. The Ambassador's mobe back to the Gulf will expense that currently, probably about $6 million. This time, we are factoring in the strength of the U.S. dollar. So we'll be taking that into account and assuming that the dollar will stay strong. So we've reduced our expectations for that.
And then finally, during the fourth quarter, historically, we've always seen our major project expense number go up as we complete projects that we've budgeted at the beginning of the year and said historically that's always been the highest in the fourth quarter. So we've tried to build that into our numbers. You take all of that into account and we believe that contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter will be between $390 million to $410 million. As always, I would note, this is contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable cost will be in addition to the amount that I just gave you.
A few other lines. G&A, we believe that will return back to the $17 million, $18 million which we've historically recorded over the past 6 or 7 quarters. Depreciation, same guidance as last quarter, $99 million to $101 million. And interest expense, we believe, will return to its normal cost, which is the $22 million which is what our outstanding debt brings us, less $10 million worth of capitalized interest or a net of $11 million.
The effective tax rate will increase it just slightly over last time. We believe it will be somewhere between the 23% to 26% range. And finally, capital expense, we are increasing our expected capital from $720 million to $800 million, and that's to reflect the Ocean Apex rig that we announced earlier in the quarter. That $800 million will be broken down between maintenance capital of $320 million. And our new-build rigs, we expect to spend about $480 million.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

The U.K., in our opinion, very efficient, highly mature regulations are actually a bonus, and we enjoy working in that location. The drilling is very easy for our customers, not really deep. There is the weather issues, but it's a great market. And then you're right next to where Brent prices, and that premium and everything makes it really, really good. There are not that many rigs that are capable of working in the North Sea. In addition to the safety case, there's standards that have to be met.

And there's certainly more demand up there than there are number of rigs.

And we took 7, 8 days, I believe, of downtime. So there wasn't a huge amount of downtime that resulted on the Confidence. And because we had a backup commitment from Murphy in the initial pop [ph] hole section, we were confident that the DP system was robust enough, as long as we -- up until the point that we had to run the stack, everybody was comfortable on that.

I think that probably is the Lexington fixtures around the leading edge rate for an international mid-water rig. Of course, as Larry said, we believe we'll have some gains from an operating cost standpoint, moving that rig into the Trinidad market. It just depends on the rig capability. You've got 1,000-foot mid-water rigs and you've got 3,500-foot mid-water rigs. So that capability then trickles into the pricing advantages and opportunities. But I think the upper end of the mid-water is in the high-2s, and more your standard 1,500-foot type mid-water rigs are in the mid-2s. That's a -- it was a great contract for us. We're very excited about it. The ability to get that type of term in the mid-water segment is just not everywhere we look. It's more of short-term as you see with the Patriot, the General. You're getting 90 days, still getting 120-day jobs. So until we start seeing that term build up, I think you'll continue to see the rates where they are, and that's the reason I made my steady comment versus increasing. But where it's possible, obviously we'll take advantage of the pricing power and opportunities with the rigs we have to put them into good markets with better margin environments.

I think that is the #1 item. As rigs get older, they do require more maintenance CapEx. But we are taking our fleet and evaluating it constantly, looking at is it worth spending x to keep this rig going? And that's kind of led to the Epoch coming down, a couple of rigs which are now down and available as our new capacity candidates. The Onyx and the Apex were in that category. So that kind of offsets it. So it's not something that I see is a huge issue for us. And we are bringing in new rigs into the fleet, and those will require less maintenance. But on the other hand, the money that we're spending on -- we got Courage and Valor, fairly new rigs, but they go into Brazil where you have to pay such high duties on anything you bring into them, and we've still been working on those. I would say those run higher maintenance CapEx then we see on some of our older rigs."

I would expect next year -- again, we're in the process of doing the budget to come in somewhere close to that, because we're going to do about the same number of surveys. And when we do a large number of surveys, the maintenance capital does tend to go up because we have the rigs in, and that's when we can spend the money on it. In 2014 and '15, the number of surveys go down. So that versus inflation in the rigs, a little bit lower. I would estimate somewhere around $300 million on a go-forward basis."

But the best thing is to look back about what we've done in the past, which is generally maintain a dividend. We recognize that that's a very important component. But on tax changes, as far as I know, there's no tax changes that impact us where we get -- just the tax changes on the recipients. And so I can't imagine that, that would impact us. If you look forward, you know that we've got CapEx to continue to upgrade our fleet and bring in new rigs but, at the same time, enough funds to continue to pay a dividend. And I'm not sure that there's any slack in there to adjust for, even if we wanted to, changes on taxes to the recipients."
