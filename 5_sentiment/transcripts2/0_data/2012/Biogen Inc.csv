We had a very productive fourth quarter and which concluded a really I think great year for Biogen Idec. Recall that in 2011, our goals were to deliver double-digit EPS growth, grow AVONEX and TYSABRI share while pursuing the serological assays and risk stratification to further unlock the value of TYSABRI, advised early-stage pipeline and continue to drive cultural change.
We delivered in all these goals and we've been a lon gway towards building the foundation for long term growth for Biogen Idec. In 2011, product total product revenues were up 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS ended the year at $5.90, a 15% increase over 2010. In 2011, our AVONEX commercial team substantially improved the business and AVONEX global sales reached $2.7 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year.
We introduced the AVONEX PEN to the European markets in Canada, thereby improving the administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest and marketing authorization of the AVONEX PEN in the U.S.
TYSABRI in-market sales grew 23% year-over-year to reach $1.5 billion in 2011, and we hit key milestones that are important for unlocking the value of TYSABRI. First, the assay for JC virus antibodies was made broadly available in both the U.S. and the EU. Second, the TYSABRI product label was updated in both the EU and the U.S. to include JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for the development of PML.
There's been tremendous interest from MS community interest risk stratification and we believe that a large majority of the TYSABRI patients now know their antibody status and that increasing numbers of patients considering TYSABRI are being tested as well.
Against long odds, we were able to convince the EMA to reverse their initially negative opinion for FAMPYRA and we obtained conditional EU marketing approval. We launched FAMPYRA in Germany in 2011 and plan additional launches this year.
Turning to R&D, our late-stage pipeline advanced substantially in 2011, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. As you know, BG-12 data in 2 large clinical trials were very encouraging. This 2 clinical trials with more than 2,600 patients represent the largest data set for any new drug in relapsing-remitting MS to date. We're now focused on bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for Daclizumab, showed impressive clinical results in 2011 and supported the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. We also completed enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing remitting MS and we completed the enrollment for EMPOWER, the First Global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
Turning to our Hemophilia programs, Phase I2 data were presented for our long-lasting Factor VIII product in Japan in 2011, addressing an important unmet need in the Hemophilia community where less frequent injections will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long term outcomes for patients.
Our Phase III trials continued to enroll successfully during the year. In fact, our clinical trial enrollment improved so much during the year that we substantially overspent our budget for these trials. That, of course, is a good over-expenditure that resulted from improved execution. In 2011, we were able to meet or exceed our enrollment targets for almost everyone of our clinical trials.
And I'd like to point out that even with these additional clinical expenses, we surpassed our earnings target. As part of our goal to drive cultural change and reinvigorate our R&D, we focused on the areas where we have the most expertise and where we have the most promising assets: neurology, immunology and hemophilia. We increased our efforts to move internal programs forward and look for new high-quality assets to grow our early-stage pipeline.
We successfully advanced our anti-LINGO program in relapsing MS, as well as our anti-TWEAK program for lupus nephritis. We announced the  collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral, highly selective Syk Inhibitor and with ISIS for compounds to target Spinal Muscular Atrophy. We also announced the joint venture with Samsung for the development of Biosimilars, leveraging our world-class protein engineering and Biologics manufacturing capabilities while allowing us to remain focus -- maintain focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative new therapies for patients.
Because of our successes in 2011, we've entered 2012 with a lot to do. We'll continue to focus on execution as we invest in our future success. Our goals for this year are to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market shares, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue. We'll invest significantly to ensure that we are well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factor VIII and Factor IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include successful regulatory filings for BG-12 this year and the appropriate ramp-up of commercial and medical capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches.
2012 is a building year for Biogen Idec. All of these activities, of course, take substantial resources. Additionally, we will continue to build our early-stage pipeline and continue our focus on culture. I'm pleased to say that we expect to accomplish this year in building and preparation for product launches while at the same time, delivering revenue and EPS growth.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive VP of R&D."
29726,145982448,212790,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments spanning the entire pipeline for research to marketed products.During Q4, we cont",1095,"Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments spanning the entire pipeline for research to marketed products.
During Q4, we continued to make considerable progress on several aspects of our late stage R&D programs which positions the company to launch a series of meaningful new drugs, addressing significant unmet medical needs for patients and positioning the company for future revenue growth.
Let me recap progress in Q4 starting with our MS pipeline. Earlier this month, we announced that the FDA approved a product label change for TYSABRI, which identifies antiJCV antibody status as a risk factor for developing PML. This is the third distinct risk factor identified and reflects our commitment to providing important benefit risk information to treating physicians and their patients when considering TYSABRI as a treatment option.
Infection with the JC virus is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive, therefore, have a greater risk of developing PML.
Moving on to BG-12, the team is aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 and we plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of this year. The profile of BG-12 seen in the DEFINE and CONFIRM Phase III studies indicates a favorable benefit risk profile for this drug with the convenience of oral dosing. While we conducted the Phase III studies with the formulation administered as 2 capsules twice or 3 times a day, we have since completed a bioequivalent study for 1 capsule formulation, which could allow for 1 capsule twice a day. We plan to also include this new formulation as part of the filing.
ADVANCE, the Phase III registrational study of peginterferon with relapsing-remitting MS completed enrollment in Q4. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA with an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as the primary endpoint. We anticipate top-line data to be available in early 2013.
In the U.S., we've also focused on providing a better patient experience with the AVONEX PEN and the AVONEX titration kit to make self-administration more convenience and to help reduce flu-like symptoms at the outset of therapy. The PDUFA date for both the AVONEX PEN and the titration kit is in the first half of this year.
Turning to the rest of our neurology pipeline. Top-line data for the EMPOWER study, the first Phase III study of dexpramipexole and ALS is anticipated in the second half of 2012. Dex is a novel, oral compound that appears to have neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function by improving mitochondrial energy utilization. EMPOWER, which has been conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment approved by the FDA, utilizes the novel primary endpoint which combine survival and functional decline. The Phase II results of dex published in Nature Magazine in November of last year, was the first positive dose-ranging study of a new agent in ALS in nearly 15 years. In this study, the combined endpoint of survival and functional decline was statistically significant when comparing low versus high doses of dex. Our current plans are to initiate endeavor the second Phase III study of dexpramipexole which incorporates higher drug doses subsequent to the EMPOWER data readout. This will allow us to incorporate any learnings from EMPOWER into the endeavor design. I want to clarify that the EMPOWER study is ongoing and thus remains blinded. We are not making the change in the second trial timing due to any knowledge or speculation about EMPOWER or due to any other signals but rather as a way of optimizing the overall data set from the 2 clinical studies.
Moving on to our Hemophilia programs. Enrollment is nearly complete in our A-LONG study, reducing the last nonsurgical patients now and we'll continue to enroll surgery patients through the first half of the year. We expect top-line data readout for both B-LONG and A-LONG studies for long-lasting recombinant Factor IX and VIII, respectively, in the second half of this year. We believe that both of these product candidates have the potential to offer compelling innovation and benefits to Hemophilia patients.
Along with the substantial progress I've just reviewed on our late stage clinical programs, we've also taken concrete steps to bolster our earlier stage development pipeline. Rebuilding the Phase I and 2 pipeline is a long-term strategic imperative for the company and will be accomplished by disciplined investments in internal discoveries and targeted transactions to obtain highly differentiated assets in our core focus areas.
We previously announced the global collaboration with ISIS Pharmaceuticals, targeting Spinal Muscular Atrophy, also known as SMA. SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. One child out of every 10,000 births worldwide is born with SMA. Children with SMA generally appear normal at birth, with symptoms developing as early as a few months after birth. The most severe forms of the disease children have significant neuromuscular defects and a lifespan of approximately 2 years. ISIS anti-sense therapy is designed to correct the underlying genetic defect that causes SMA. This collaboration fits with our mission of bringing innovative therapies to patients with serious neurologic diseases. I'm also pleased with the progress that the R&D team has made advancing and adding to our Phase I and II portfolio. The anti-LINGO and relapsing MS and the anti-TWEAK antibody and lupus nephritis programs have been approved to go to Phase II and we expect patient dosing to start in the first half and second half of 2012, respectively.
These 2 programs are highly differentiated therapies, discovered and developed internally, and we'll have more to say about these 2 programs as Phase II dosing begins.
We've also advanced 2 additional programs from research into development in 2011. We plan to hold our R&D data here to highlight progress in the strength in innovation of our growing early-stage pipeline. More details to follow on this event.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has shown this past quarter. Our late-stage pipeline is one of the most enviable in the industry and we're making tangible progress on building a sustainable and high-value early-stage pipeline. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."

The MS franchise continued its strong momentum into the fourth quarter as we delivered double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX continued to show resilience in the U.S. while we experienced growth ex-U.S. Worldwide, units grew 1% while revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter, capping off a solid year for the franchise and highlighting our refocused commercial execution. Despite pressure on the ABCRE market, fourth quarter U.S. AVONEX units were in line with the previous quarter, with the anticipated U.S. approval of AVONEX PEN and for the AVONEX titration kit in 2012, we will continue to build upon these 2011 results.
Outside the U.S., fourth quarter units and revenues both grew 4% year-on-year and for the full year, units came 6%. AVONEX remains the market leader and share growth was strong in countries where we have launched the AVONEX PEN such as the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Netherlands.
Moving to TYSABRI, we made tremendous progress with both sales performance and the advancement of risk stratification, which continues to drive interest in the brand. The JCV assay became commercially available in both the EU and U.S. last year and as of December 31, there have been approximately 87,000 JCV tests globally.
Some of which are patients being tested for the second time. We believe that the majority of TYSABRI patients have now been tested for their JCV antibody status. As we saw in last quarter, the very rapid uptake of the assay created an even net new patient growth due to increase discontinuation as more patients became aware of the their JCV antibody status. At the same time, demand for TYSABRI remained robust and we remain confident that the increased interest in risk stratification will continue to drive strong demand going forward.
Full year global units increased 16% while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 20%. Net new patients increased by 7,200 for the year, an increase of 13%.
In the U.S., fourth quarter TYSABRI units grew 10% year-on-year. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. For the full year, units grew 12%, with the recent FDA label approval that identified the antiJCV antibody status as an additional risk factor, we are now able to speak actively with neurologist and revived the MS community with more confidence when considering treatment options. Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 19% for the full year and 20% in the fourth quarter. In these markets, TYSABRI also grew 2x faster than the overall MS market growth rate, driven by both patient growth and additional country launches.
While we're still in the beginning stages of the FAMPYRA launch, we're encouraged by the early strong results. There's been pent-up demand for therapy and given our strong position in the MS marketplace, we continue to gain access to physicians and drive additional interest. In Germany, we've seen strong uptake with more than 7,000 patients exposed to FAMPYRA through year end since its launch in September 2011. This important therapies is currently available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland.
Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe and regulatory filings are planned in over 20 additional countries this year.
In 2012, our focus will be to drive our existing commercial therapies, keeping the momentum we've seen in 2011 going forward. We're excited about preparing our organization for potentially multiple product launches. With the expectation of the first half 2013 launch for BG-12, we are making investments now in product positioning, promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supply chain. We plan to build the customer-facing resources later in the year.
Similarly, preparations are underway as we make investments in our Hemophilia franchise for unexpected mid-2013 launch. We are new to the Hemophilia market but we've already put in place a commercial team composed of seasoned professionals with significant experience in the Hemophilia space which we will scale up as we get closer to launch. We are developing relationships with the medical and scientific community globally and we will be leveraging our strengths in patient services.
We believe that this will offer a competitive advantage to the Hemophilia marketplace. We're making great progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple product launches in the coming years. I'm confident that we'll continue to build upon our commercial foundation and that will drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.22 in the fourth quarter and $5.04 for the full year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter include $50 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $30 million for contingent consideration and $3 million in stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51 for Q4, representing a 6% increase versus prior year and for the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.90 representing a 15% increase. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 9% to $1.3 billion and grew 7% for the full year, surpassing $5 billion.
In the U.S., AVONEX grew 10% in Q4 to $421 million, while the full year U.S. AVONEX revenues increased 9% to $1.6 billion. Inventory and the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks. Internationally, Q4 AVONEX revenue was $282 million, an increase of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact this quarter. For the full year international AVONEX revenue increased 3% to  $1.1 billion.
Foreign exchange strengthened AVONEX revenue by $51 million, however, this was offset by $31 million hedge loss as compared to a $35 million hedge gain in 2010.
TYSABRI worldwide end-market sales were $381 million in Q4 and $1.5 billion for the year, up 14% and 23%, respectively. Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI revenue of $269 million in Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year.
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew by 25% to $87 million. Full year TYSABRI product revenue was $326 million, an increase of 29%.
Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $182 million and $753 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were impacted by a $14 million accrual related to a discount in our Italian affiliate. We received notification from the Italian National Medicines Agency stating that the sales of TYSABRI had exceeded a limit established during our 2006 price determination. We've challenged the agency's claim however, our fourth quarter accounting treatment has resulted in the $14 million reserve related to this issue. We hope to have resolution in the first half of 2012.
The impact of foreign exchange for full year TYSABRI added $38 million to international revenues versus prior year which was offset by a $6 million loss from hedging compared to an $11 million hedge gain in 2010.
Note also similar to prior quarters, we've updated prior quarter TYSABRI patient numbers to reflect the best information available.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $721 million in the fourth quarter, up 4%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.9 billion, up 6% driven by an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit-sharing expense reimbursement from this business was $228 million for Q4 and $879 million for the full year. Royalties and profit sharing of sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q4 were $30 million and $118 million for the full year.
The result was $258 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q4 and $997 million for the full year. FAMPYRA revenue was $10 million for Q4, largely driven by Germany, but also includes sales from select European countries and Australia.
Royalties were $53 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 16%. The increase was mainly due to  hitting a new royalty Tier on sales of ANGIOMAX. This new Tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. For the full year, 2011, royalty revenue was $158 million, an increase of 15%.
We recorded $20 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. For 2011, we recorded $57 million of corporate partner revenue.
Now turning to expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Fourth quarter cost of sales were $140 million or 11% of revenues, which included increased global JC virus assay test, and the increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. Fourth quarter R&D expense were $338 million or 25% of revenues, which included the $36 million payment support and an increased spending related to our late-stage programs.
For the full year, R&D expense was $1.2 billion or 24% of revenues. Q4 SG&A expense was $282 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $73 million in expense for the quarter and $318 million for the year.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, benefiting from a higher level of orphan drug research credits in favorable settlements from prior-year audits. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million, essentially flat versus prior quarters.
During Q4, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total cost of $111 million for the purpose of 2012 share stabilization. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S..
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.51 in the fourth quarter and $5.90 for full year. Now let me turn to full year 2012 guidance.
We expect full year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits. Cost of sales is expected to be between 9% and 10% of sales, driven by third-party manufacturing, JC virus assay test and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. R&D is expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue, a modest increase versus 2011. The R&D spend continues to be driven by several Phase III trials which will be at the high point of patient accruals, including peginterferon, Dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factor trials, Daclizumab and the safety extension studies for BG-12. Additionally, in January, we initiated sites for the new pediatric studies for Factor VIII and Factor IX. R&D also reflects the recent business development deals with Portola and ISIS which are important steps to rebuilding our early-stage pipeline.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, up from 2011, primarily driven by the commercial ramp-up in preparation for the potential multiple product launches in 2013.
We expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be between 24% and 26% of pretax income. We expect the tax rate to benefit from higher orphan drug credit and also benefit from the expected conclusion in mid-2012 of the interferon beta royalty payment from our foreign affiliate to our U.S. affiliate.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $6.10 and $6.20, and GAAP EPS to be between $5.46 and $5.56. These anticipated results assumes the current FX rates and excludes any material risk related to the macroeconomic environment in Europe.
Also, full year EPS guidance assumes share stabilization. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out that we expect the first quarter of 2012 to be unfavorably impacted by certain items. Specifically, ANGIOMAX royalties will reset to a lower revenue level in Q1 and as in the past and our R&D expenses will include the $29 million upfront payment to ISIS. Overall, we expect 2012 to be a very important financial year. Our business plan strikes a proper balance in making prudent, prelaunch investments, continuing to build an advanced pharmacy pipeline while delivering earnings growth. These investments by design should have a relatively quick and meaningful put payback, poising our company for future bottom-line expansion. Now, over to George for his closing comments"

In the early part of the year, we saw an increase in discontinuations in the U.S. as I think we've talked about because as patients went through the STRATIFY study, we got some lumpiness particularly in the first quarter and the first half of the year. We saw a nice recovery from that and lots of increased demand through the year. We are facing on a country-by-country basis in Europe, somewhat of a repeat of that in the later part of 2011 and early 2012. So I think that's what you've seen at the U.S. experience plays out, we're confident that those numbers will recover because we see more demand from the product after we get through that initial discount. In terms of the nature of the patients, I think we have seen the general trend is more confidence making physicians confident moving the treatment earlier in the period. And I think we'll continue to see that going forward."

In terms of the numbers of patients, there's 20,000 to 30,000 patients with ALS in the United States. And probably an equal number in Europe. Who would be eligible? If the results are compelling, I think it's really not too much out for these patients except for which has a very, very modest treatment effect. So I think a lot of patients would probably opt to go on the drug. Remember that when we open enrollment in this trial, the interest was so high that we enrolled patients in record speed and we completed enrollment far ahead of schedule.

You know what is true is that the $300 million in savings that we achieved are still there, they're in there. We are in the year now when our clinical late stage clinical trial enrollment is likely at its maximum point. As Paul went through in his statement, PEGylated Interferon, Dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factors, the safety extension studies for BG-12 are all at their peak and so a large fraction of our R&D dollars, now way over half of our R&D dollars is going just to pay for those trials. They enrolled more quickly than we had anticipated which means we got up to the maximum costs more quickly than we had anticipated. And frankly, as you think about the company going forward, you would expect to have some attrition. And the that's normal. We didn't have any. And failure is cheap and success costs money. And so we are paying for those trials. At the same time, because we know the data for BG-12 and we are let's say preparing and optimistic about Factor VIII and IX, we're spending substantially what's a substantial amount of resources to prepare for the launches of those products. You can look at many of the product launches that have been done recently, some of them have gone well, some of them haven't. And we need to make sure we get ours right. And that takes some preparation. And so we're spending on those as well. So we have, I think, there's a difference in spend where you are inefficient and wasting money, not spending adequately on the commercial preparation would be foolish savings. So we're not, not doing that. We're spending, I think, prudently and thoughtfully but we are investing appropriately. And we are like a saddled with a lot of Phase III costs, which is in the end, a good thing. This is the year when we think all those are maximized."

Yes, the guidance for 2012 shows a little bit of improvement vis-à-vis our last few years of guidance. And that's a couple of factors.

ISIS would be one that would. It's a number of years off. Additionally, what I noted is that is that outside the United States, we have heretofore had a royalty payment that is paid from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. affiliate that will end in mid-2012. So that is sustainable going forward. Over the longer term, I think that all in all, there's downward pressure on our effective tax rate as BG-12 becomes a greater part of our profit mix and conversely, the RITUXAN cash flow that is subject to essentially all U.S. taxes becomes lower percentage of our profit mix. Both of those are probably offset by the fact that we intend to do or continue to do cost sharing on programs. So we intend to still which has the effect for a portion of R&D not capturing some tax deduction on those expenses.

Most of those write-offs were excess in obsolescence write-offs related to We actually had a supply agreement that is obviously a number of years old related to the divested products and just literally because the end market sales have attenuated there. We've had to take a write off in Q4. We think that is for the most part, behind us. Our yields across the plants have been on track. And then I think the other thing going in 2012, is that we will benefit a little bit from a more productive, if you will, Biologics manufacturing going back in late 2009 and into 2010. I mean, curiously, our productivity in a given year benefits the P&L a number of years down the line simply because of the inventory balance is that we hold in this business. We will continue to have costs that are related to the assay that we do think that are very important particularly at this stage of TYSABRI and in risk stratification to be behind the brand. There's an opportunity for improvement if we can get that reimbursed in the United States because currently we are in the burden of that in the P&L. As you have inferred that as RITUXAN may become lower percentage the mix had it very favorable gross margin obviously.

We had a very productive fourth quarter and -- which concluded a really, I think, great year for Biogen Idec. Recall that in 2011, our goals were to deliver double-digit EPS growth, grow AVONEX and TYSABRI share while pursuing the serological assay and risk stratification to further unlock the value of TYSABRI, advanced or late stage pipeline and continue to drive cultural change. We delivered on all these goals and we've run a long way towards building a foundation for long term growth for Biogen Idec. 
In 2011, our product -- total product revenues were up 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS ended the year at $5.90, a 15% increase over 2010. In 2011, our AVONEX commercial team substantially improved the business and AVONEX global sales reached $2.7 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year.
We introduced the AVONEX PEN to the European markets and Canada, thereby improving the administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest and we filed for marketing authorization of the AVONEX PEN in the U.S.
TYSABRI in-market sales grew 23% year-over-year to reach $1.5 billion in 2011, and we hit key milestones that are important for unlocking the value of TYSABRI. First, the assay for JC virus antibodies was made broadly available in both the U.S. and the EU. Second, the TYSABRI product label was updated in both the EU and the U.S. to include JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for the development of PML.
There's been tremendous interest from the MS community in risk stratification and we believe that the large majority of TYSABRI patients now know their antibody status and that increasing numbers of patients considering TYSABRI are being tested as well.
Against long odds, we were able to convince the EMA to reverse their initially negative opinion for FAMPYRA and we obtained conditional EU marketing approval. We launched FAMPYRA in Germany in 2011 and plan additional launches this year.
Turning to R&D, our late-stage pipeline advanced substantially in 2011, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. As you know, BG-12 data in 2 large clinical trials were very encouraging. These 2 clinical trials, with more than 2,600 patients, represent the largest data set for any new drug in relapsing-remitting MS to date. We're now focused on bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for Daclizumab, showed impressive clinical results in 2011 and supported the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. We also completed enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS, and we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
Turning to our Hemophilia programs, Phase I/II data were presented for our Long-Lasting Factor VIII product in Kyoto candidate [ph] in Japan in 2011, addressing an important unmet need in the Hemophilia community, where less frequent injections will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes for patients.
Our Phase III trials continued to enroll successfully during the year. In fact, our clinical trial enrollment improved so much during the year that we substantially overspent our budget for these trials. That, of course, is a good over-expenditure that resulted from improved execution. In 2011, we were able to meet or exceed our enrollment targets for almost everyone of our clinical trials.
And I'd like to point out that even with these additional clinical expenses, we surpassed our earnings target. As part of our goal to drive cultural change and reinvigorate R&D, we focused on the areas where we have the most expertise and where we have the most promising assets: neurology, immunology and Hemophilia. We increased our efforts to move internal programs forward and look for new high-quality assets to grow our early-stage pipeline.
We successfully advanced our Anti-Lingo program in relapsing MS, as well as our Anti-TWEAK program for lupus nephritis. We announced the  collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral, highly selective Syk Inhibitor and with ISIS for compounds to target spinal muscular atrophy. We also announced the joint venture with Samsung for the development of Biosimilars, leveraging our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities while allowing us to remain focus -- maintain focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative new therapies for patients.
Because of our successes in 2011, we've entered 2012 with a lot to do. We'll continue to focus on execution as we invest in our future success. Our goals for this year are to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market shares, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue. We'll invest significantly to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include successful regulatory filings for BG-12 this year and the appropriate ramp-up of commercial and medical capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches.
2012 is a building year for Biogen Idec. All of these activities, of course, take substantial resources. Additionally, we'll continue to build our early-stage pipeline and continue our focus on culture. I'm pleased to say that we expect to accomplish this year of building and preparation for product launches while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive VP of R&D."
29726,145982448,212963,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.During Q4, we co",1095,"Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.
During Q4, we continued to make considerable progress on several aspects of our late stage R&D programs, which positions the company to launch a series of meaningful new drugs, addressing significant unmet medical needs for patients and positioning the company for future revenue growth.
Let me recap progress in Q4, starting with our MS pipeline. Earlier this month, we announced that the FDA approved a product label change for TYSABRI, which identifies antiJCV antibody status as a risk factor for developing PML. This is the third distinct risk factor identified, and reflects our commitment to providing important benefit risk information to treating physicians and their patients when considering TYSABRI as a treatment option.
Infection with the JC virus is required for the development of PML, and patients who are antiJCV antibody positive, therefore, have a greater risk of developing PML.
Moving on to BG-12, the team is aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 and we plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of this year. The profile of BG-12 seen in the DEFINE and CONFIRM Phase III studies indicates a favorable benefit risk profile for this drug with the convenience of oral dosing. While we conducted the Phase III studies with the formulation administered as 2 capsules twice or 3 times a day, we have since completed a bioequivalent study for 1 capsule formulation, which could allow for 1 capsule twice a day. We plan to also include this new formulation as part of the filing.
ADVANCE, the Phase III registrational study of PEG-Interferon with relapsing-remitting MS completed enrollment in Q4. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA with an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as the primary endpoint. We anticipate top-line data to be available in early 2013.
In the U.S., we've also focused on providing a better patient experience with the AVONEX PEN and the AVONEX Titration Kit to make self-administration more convenience and to help reduce flu-like symptoms at the outset of therapy. The PDUFA date for both the AVONEX PEN and the Titration Kit is in the first half of this year.
Turning to the rest of our neurology pipeline. Top-line data for the EMPOWER study, the first Phase III study of dexpramipexole and ALS is anticipated in the second half of 2012. Dex is a novel, oral compound that appears to have neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function by improving mitochondrial energy utilization. EMPOWER, which has been conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment approved by the FDA, utilizes a novel primary endpoint, which combines survival and functional decline. The Phase II results of dex published in Nature Medicine in November of last year, was the first positive dose-ranging study of a new agent in ALS in nearly 15 years. In this study, the combined endpoint of survival and functional decline was statistically significant when comparing low versus high doses of dex. Our current plans are to initiate endeavor, the second Phase III study of dexpramipexole, which incorporates higher drug doses subsequent to the EMPOWER data readout. This will allow us to incorporate any learnings from EMPOWER into the endeavor design. I want to clarify that the EMPOWER study is ongoing, and thus, remains blinded. We're not making the change in the second trial timing due to any knowledge or speculation about EMPOWER or due to any other signals, but rather as a way of optimizing the overall data set from the 2 clinical studies.
Moving on to our Hemophilia programs. Enrollment is nearly complete in our A-LONG study. We're dosing the last nonsurgical patients now, and we'll continue to enroll surgery patients through the first half of the year. We expect top-line data readout for both B-LONG and A-LONG studies for Long-Lasting Recombinant Factor IX and VIII, respectively, in the second half of this year. We believe that both of these product candidates have the potential to offer compelling innovation and benefits to Hemophilia patients.
Along with the substantial progress I just reviewed on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken concrete steps to bolster our earlier stage development pipeline. Rebuilding the Phase I and 2 pipeline is a long-term strategic imperative for the company and will be accomplished by disciplined investments in internal discoveries and targeted transactions to obtain highly differentiated assets in our core focus areas.
We previously announced the global collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, targeting spinal muscular atrophy, also known as SMA. SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness, and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. One child out of every 10,000 births worldwide is born with SMA. Children with SMA generally appear normal at birth, with symptoms developing as early as a few months after birth. The most severe forms of the disease children have significant neuromuscular defects and a lifespan of approximately 2 years. Isis anti-sense therapy is designed to correct the underlying genetic defect that causes SMA. This collaboration fits with our mission of bringing innovative therapies to patients with serious neurologic diseases. I'm also pleased with the progress that the R&D team has made advancing and adding to our Phase I and II portfolio. The Anti-Lingo and relapsing MS and the Anti-TWEAK antibody and lupus nephritis programs have been approved to go to Phase II, and we expect patient dosing to start in the first half and second half of 2012, respectively.
These 2 programs are highly differentiated therapies, discovered and developed internally, and we'll have more to say about these 2 programs as Phase II dosing begins.
We've also advanced 2 additional programs from research into development in 2011. We plan to hold an R&D day this year to highlight progress in the strength in innovation of our growing early-stage pipeline. More details to follow on this event.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has shown this past quarter. Our late-stage pipeline is one of the most enviable in the industry and we're making tangible progress on building a sustainable and high-value early-stage pipeline. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."

The MS franchise continued its strong momentum into the fourth quarter as we delivered double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX continued to show resilience in the U.S. while we experienced growth ex-U.S. Worldwide, units grew 1% while revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter, capping off a solid year for the franchise and highlighting our refocused commercial execution. Despite pressure on the ABCRE market, fourth quarter U.S. AVONEX units were in line with the previous quarter, with the anticipated U.S. approval of AVONEX PEN, and for the AVONEX Titration Kit in 2012, we will continue to build upon these 2011 results.
Outside the U.S., fourth quarter units and revenues both grew 4% year-on-year, and for the full year, units gained 6%. AVONEX remains the market leader, and share growth was strong in countries where we have launched the AVONEX PEN such as the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Netherlands.
Moving to TYSABRI. We made tremendous progress with both sales performance and the advancement of risk stratification, which continues to drive interest in the brand. The JCV assay became commercially available in both the EU and U.S. last year. And as of December 31, there have been approximately 87,000 JCV tests globally, some of which are patients being tested for the second time. We believe that the majority of TYSABRI patients have now been tested for their JCV antibody status. As we saw in last quarter, the very rapid uptake of the assay created uneven net new patient growth due to increase discontinuation as more patients became aware of the their JCV antibody status. At the same time, demand for TYSABRI remained robust and we remain confident that the increased interest in risk stratification will continue to drive strong demand going forward.
Full-year global units increased 16% while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 20%. Net new patients increased by 7,200 for the year, an increase of 13%.
In the U.S., fourth quarter TYSABRI units grew 10% year-on-year. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. For the full year, units grew 12%. With the recent FDA label approval that identified the antiJCV antibody status as an additional risk factor, we are now able to speak actively with neurologists and provide the MS community with more confidence when considering treatment options. Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 19% for the full year and 20% in the fourth quarter. In these markets, TYSABRI also grew 2x faster than the overall MS market growth rate, driven by both patient growth and additional country launches.
While we're still in the beginning stages of the FAMPYRA launch, we're encouraged by the early strong results. There's been pent-up demand for the therapy, and given our strong position in the MS marketplace, we continue to gain access to position and drive additional interest. 
In Germany, we've seen strong uptake, with more than 7,000 patients exposed to FAMPYRA through year end since its launch in September 2011. This important therapy is currently available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe and regulatory filings are planned in over 20 additional countries this year.
In 2012, our focus will be to drive our existing commercial therapies, keeping the momentum we've seen in 2011 going forward. We're excited about preparing our organization for potentially multiple product launches. With the expectation of the first-half 2013 launch for BG-12, we are making investments now in product positioning, promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supply chain. We plan to build customer-facing resources later in the year.
Similarly, preparations are underway as we make investments in our Hemophilia franchise for an expected mid-2013 launch. We are new to the Hemophilia market but we've already put in place a commercial team composed of seasoned professionals with significant experience in the Hemophilia space, which we will scale up as we get closer to launch. We are developing relationships with the medical and scientific community globally and we will be leveraging our strengths in patient services.
We believe that this will offer a competitive advantage to the Hemophilia marketplace. We're making great progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple product launches in the coming years. I'm confident that we'll continue to build upon our commercial foundation and that will drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 25% to $87 million. Full year TYSABRI product revenue was $326 million, an increase of 29%.
Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $182 million and $753 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were impacted by a $14 million accrual related to a discount in our Italian affiliate. We received notification from the Italian National Medicines Agency stating that the sales of TYSABRI had exceeded a limit established during our 2006 price determination. We've challenged the agency's claim. However, our fourth quarter accounting treatment has resulted in the $14 million reserve related to this issue. We hope to have resolution in the first half of 2012.
The impact of foreign exchange for full year TYSABRI added $38 million to international revenues versus prior year, which was offset by a $6 million loss from hedging compared to an $11 million hedge gain in 2010.
Note also similar to prior quarters, we've updated prior quarter TYSABRI patient numbers to reflect the best information available.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $721 million in the fourth quarter, up 4%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.9 billion, up 6% driven by an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit-sharing expense reimbursement from this business was $228 million for Q4 and $879 million for the full year. Royalties and profit share in sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q4 were $30 million and $118 million for the full year.
The result was $258 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q4 and $997 million for the full year. FAMPYRA revenue was $10 million for Q4, largely driven by Germany, but also includes sales from select European countries and Australia.
Royalties were $53 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 16%. The increase was mainly due to  hitting a new royalty tier on sales of ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. For the full year 2011, royalty revenue was $158 million, an increase of 15%.
We recorded $20 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. For 2011, we recorded $57 million of corporate partner revenue.
Now turning to expense lines from the non-GAAP P&L. Fourth quarter cost of sales were $140 million or 11% of revenues, which included increased global JC virus assay test and the increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. Fourth quarter R&D expense was $338 million or 25% of revenues, which included the $36 million payment to Portola and an increased spending related to our late-stage programs.
For the full year, R&D expense was $1.2 billion or 24% of revenues. Q4 SG&A expense was $282 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $73 million in expense for the quarter and $318 million for the year.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, benefiting from a higher level of orphan drug research credits in favorable settlements from prior-year audits. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million, essentially flat versus prior quarters.
During Q4, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total cost of $111 million for the purpose of 2012 share stabilization. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.51 in the fourth quarter and $5.90 for full year. Now let me turn to full year 2012 guidance.
We expect full-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits. Cost of sales is expected to be between 9% and 10% of sales, driven by third-party manufacturing, JC virus assay test and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. R&D is expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue, a modest increase versus 2011. The R&D spend continues to be driven by several Phase III trials, which will be at the high point of patient accruals, including PEG-Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factor trials, Daclizumab and the safety extension studies for BG-12. Additionally, in January, we initiated sites for the new pediatric studies for Factor VIII and Factor IX. R&D also reflects the recent business development deals with Portola and Isis, which are important steps to rebuilding our early-stage pipeline.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, up from 2011, primarily driven by the commercial ramp-up in preparation for the potential multiple product launches in 2013.
We expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be between 24% and 26% of pretax income. We expect the tax rate to benefit from higher orphan drug credit and also benefit from the expected conclusion in mid-2012 of the interferon beta royalty payment from our foreign affiliate to our U.S. affiliate.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $6.10 and $6.20 and GAAP EPS to be between $5.46 and $5.56. These anticipated results assume the current FX rates and exclude any material risk related to the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Also full-year EPS guidance assumes share stabilization. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out that we expect the first quarter of 2012 to be unfavorably impacted by certain items. Specifically, ANGIOMAX royalties will reset to a low revenue level in Q1 as in the past, and our R&D expenses will include the $29 million upfront payment to Isis. 
Overall, we expect 2012 to be a very important financial year. Our business plan strikes a proper balance in making prudent, pre-launch investments, continuing to build an advanced to promising pipeline while delivering earnings growth. These investments by design should have a relatively quick and meaningful put payback, poising our company for future bottom-line expansion.

I mean, if the results are compelling, I think it's really not too much else for these patients except for Riluzole, which has a very, very modest treatment effect. So I think a lot of patients would probably opt to go on the drug. Remember that when we opened enrollment in this trial, the interest was so high that we enrolled patients in record speed and we completed enrollment far ahead of schedule.

I think your plan was to improve strategic focus, deliver $300 million in savings and 350 basis points improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. But if I look at the midpoint of the guidance range for 2012, we're looking at 47% of revenues going to SG&A and R&D, which is about, in my calculation, is 40 -- about 40 basis points better than 2010.

It's -- you know what is true is that the $300 million in savings that we achieved are still there, they're in there. We are in a year now when our clinical -- our late-stage clinical trial enrollment is likely at its maximum points. As Paul went through in his statement, PEGylated Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factors, daclizumab, the safety extension studies for BG-12 are all at their peak. And so a large fraction of our R&D dollars, now way over half of our R&D dollars, is going just to pay for those trial. They enrolled more quickly than we had anticipated, which means we got up to the maximum costs more quickly than we had anticipated. And frankly, as you think about the company going forward, you would expect to have some attrition. And the that's normal. We didn't have any. And failure is cheap and success costs money, and so we are paying for those trials. At the same time, because we know the data for BG-12, and we are, let's say, preparing and optimistic about Factor VIII and IX, we're spending substantially -- what's a substantial amount of resources to prepare for the launches of those products. You can look at many of the product launches that have been done recently. Some of them have gone well, some of them haven't. And we need to make sure we get ours right, and that takes some preparation. And so we're spending on those as well. So we have -- I think, there's a difference in spend where you are inefficient and wasting money. Not spending adequately on the commercial preparation would be foolish savings. So we're not, not doing that. We're spending, I think, prudently and thoughtfully, but we are investing appropriately. And we are like saddled with a lot of Phase III costs, which is, in the end, a good thing. But this is the year when I think all those are maximized."

And those would naturally come to an end and the cost will taper down and R&D costs will come down. And assuming that our early-stage pipeline develops along normal metrics, yes, it'll probably come down to that number you said. If the pipeline is less successful than we hoped, it could be lower.

Yes, the guidance for 2012 shows a little bit of improvement vis-à-vis our last few years of guidance. And that's a couple of factors. The orphan drug programs that we have, specifically Factor VIII, Factor IX, dex, all have a visibility to capture orphan drug research credits, which over the long haul, it depends on the shape of programs kind of coming forward that may kind of apply for that. Isis would be one that would. But that is a number of years off. Additionally, what I noted is that outside the United States, we have heretofore had a royalty payment that is paid from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. affiliate that will end in mid-2012. So that is sustainable going forward. Over the longer term, I think that all in all, there's downward pressure on our effective tax rate as BG-12 becomes a greater part of our profit mix. And conversely, the RITUXAN cash flow that is subject to essentially all U.S. taxes becomes lower percentage of our profit mix. Both of those are probably offset by the fact that we intend to do or continue to do cost sharing on programs. So we intend to still -- which has the effect of -- for a portion of R&D not capturing some tax deduction on those expenses. But all told, I think it's a modestly favorable story over the next couple of years and a good story over the longer term."

It's been an important way to do that and create shareholder value. The Portola and ISIS deals kind of show our indication to continue that strategic kind of point of view. Historically, we've been very disciplined on our deployment of cash, and continue to do so and look for all ways. I mean, the guidance is share stabilization if we decide to kind of return cash to shareholders, we're going to communicate that and update accordingly."

Yes, I think the other reason it picked up a little bit was we had a little bit more than normal write-offs in Q4 of 2011. Most of those write-offs were excess in obsolescence write-offs related to ZEVALIN. So we have actually a supply agreement that is, obviously, a number of years old related to the divested product and just literally because the end market sales have attenuated there. We've had to take a write-off in Q4. We think that is for the most part, behind us. Our yields across the plant have been on track. And then I think the other thing going into 2012 is that we will benefit a little bit from a more productive, if you will, biologics manufacturing going back in late 2009 and into 2010. So I mean, curiously, our productivity in a given year benefits the P&L a number of years down the line simply because of the inventory balance is that we hold in this business. We will continue to have costs that are related to the assay that we do think that are very important, particularly at this stage of TYSABRI and in risk stratification to be behind the brand. There's an opportunity for improvement if we can get that reimbursed in the United States, because currently we and Elan bear the burden on the P&L. As you had inferred that as RITUXAN may become lower percentage of the mix, that has a very favorable gross margin obviously. But I think the products that come on also are pretty strong gross margins, kind of BG-12, et cetera.

We had a very productive fourth quarter and -- which concluded a really, I think, great year for Biogen Idec. Recall that in 2011, our goals were to deliver double-digit EPS growth, grow AVONEX and TYSABRI share while pursuing the serological assay and risk stratification to further unlock the value of TYSABRI, advance our late stage pipeline and continue to drive cultural change. We delivered on all these goals and we've run a long way towards building a foundation for long term growth for Biogen Idec. 
In 2011, our product -- total product revenues were up 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS ended the year at $5.90, a 15% increase over 2010. In 2011, our AVONEX commercial team substantially improved the business and AVONEX global sales reached $2.7 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year.
We introduced the AVONEX PEN to the European markets and Canada, thereby improving the administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest and we filed for marketing authorization of the AVONEX PEN in the U.S.
TYSABRI end-market sales grew 23% year-over-year to reach $1.5 billion in 2011, and we hit key milestones that are important for unlocking the value of TYSABRI. First, the assay for JC virus antibodies was made broadly available in both the U.S. and the EU. Second, the TYSABRI product label was updated in both the EU and the U.S. to include JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for the development of PML.
There's been tremendous interest from the MS community in risk stratification and we believe that the large majority of TYSABRI patients now know their antibody status and that increasing numbers of patients considering TYSABRI are being tested as well.
Against long odds, we were able to convince the EMA to reverse their initially negative opinion for FAMPYRA and we obtained conditional EU marketing approval. We launched FAMPYRA in Germany in 2011 and plan additional launches this year.
Turning to R&D, our late-stage pipeline advanced substantially in 2011, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. As you know, BG-12 data in 2 large clinical trials were very encouraging. These 2 clinical trials, with more than 2,600 patients, represent the largest data set for any new drug in relapsing-remitting MS to date. We're now focused on bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for Daclizumab, showed impressive clinical results in 2011 and supported the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. We also completed enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS, and we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
Turning to our Hemophilia programs, Phase I/II data were presented for our Long-Lasting Factor VIII product in Kyoto candidate [ph] in Japan in 2011, addressing an important unmet need in the Hemophilia community, where less frequent injections will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes for patients.
Our Phase III trials continued to enroll successfully during the year. In fact, our clinical trial enrollment improved so much during the year that we substantially overspent our budget for these trials. That, of course, is a good over-expenditure that resulted from improved execution. In 2011, we were able to meet or exceed our enrollment targets for almost everyone of our clinical trials.
And I'd like to point out that even with these additional clinical expenses, we surpassed our earnings target. As part of our goal to drive cultural change and reinvigorate R&D, we focused on the areas where we have the most expertise and where we have the most promising assets: neurology, immunology and Hemophilia. We increased our efforts to move internal programs forward and looked for new high-quality assets to grow our early-stage pipeline.
We successfully advanced our Anti-Lingo program in relapsing MS, as well as our Anti-TWEAK program for lupus nephritis. We announced the  collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral, highly selective Syk Inhibitor and with ISIS for compounds to target spinal muscular atrophy. We also announced the joint venture with Samsung for the development of Biosimilars, leveraging our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities while allowing us to remain focus -- maintain focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative new therapies for patients.
Because of our successes in 2011, we've entered 2012 with a lot to do. We'll continue to focus on execution as we invest in our future success. Our goals for this year are to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market shares, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue. We'll invest significantly to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include successful regulatory filings for BG-12 this year and the appropriate ramp-up of commercial and medical capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches.
2012 is a building year for Biogen Idec. All of these activities, of course, take substantial resources. Additionally, we'll continue to build our early-stage pipeline and continue our focus on culture. I'm pleased to say that we expect to accomplish this year of building and preparation for product launches while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive VP of R&D."

Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.During Q4, we co",1098,"Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.
During Q4, we continued to make considerable progress on several aspects of our late stage R&D programs, which positions the company to launch a series of meaningful new drugs, addressing significant unmet medical needs for patients and positioning the company for future revenue growth.
Let me recap progress in Q4, starting with our MS pipeline. Earlier this month, we announced that the FDA approved a product label change for TYSABRI, which identifies antiJCV antibody status as a risk factor for developing PML. This is the third distinct risk factor identified, and reflects our commitment to providing important benefit risk information to treating physicians and their patients when considering TYSABRI as a treatment option.
Infection with the JC virus is required for the development of PML, and patients who are antiJCV antibody positive, therefore, have a greater risk of developing PML.
Moving on to BG-12, the team is aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 and we plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of this year. The profile of BG-12 seen in the DEFINE and CONFIRM Phase III studies indicates a favorable benefit risk profile for this drug with the convenience of oral dosing. While we conducted the Phase III studies with the formulation administered as 2 capsules twice or 3 times a day, we have since completed a bioequivalent study for 1 capsule formulation, which could allow for 1 capsule twice a day. We plan to also include this new formulation as part of the filing.
ADVANCE, the Phase III registrational study of PEG-Interferon and 1,500 patients with relapsing-remitting MS completed enrollment in Q4. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA with an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as the primary endpoint. We anticipate top-line data to be available in early 2013.
In the U.S., we've also focused on providing a better patient experience with the AVONEX PEN and the AVONEX Titration Kit to make self-administration more convenient and to help reduce flu-like symptoms at the outset of therapy. The PDUFA date for both the AVONEX PEN and the Titration Kit is in the first half of this year.
Turning to the rest of our neurology pipeline. Top-line data for the EMPOWER study, the first Phase III study of dexpramipexole and ALS is anticipated in the second half of 2012. Dex is a novel, oral compound that appears to have neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function by improving mitochondrial energy utilization. EMPOWER, which has been conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment approved by the FDA, utilizes a novel primary endpoint, which combines survival and functional decline. The Phase II results of dex published in Nature Medicine in November of last year, was the first positive dose-ranging study of a new agent in ALS in nearly 15 years. In this study, the combined endpoint of survival and functional decline was statistically significant when comparing low versus high doses of dex. Our current plans are to initiate endeavor, the second Phase III study of dexpramipexole, which incorporates higher drug doses subsequent to the EMPOWER data readout. This will allow us to incorporate any learnings from EMPOWER into the endeavor design. I want to clarify that the EMPOWER study is ongoing, and thus, remains blinded. We're not making the change in the second trial timing due to any knowledge or speculation about EMPOWER or due to any other signals, but rather as a way of optimizing the overall data set from the 2 clinical studies.
Moving on to our Hemophilia programs. Enrollment is nearly complete in our A-LONG study. We're dosing the last nonsurgical patients now, and we'll continue to enroll surgery patients through the first half of the year. We expect top-line data readout for both B-LONG and A-LONG studies for Long-Lasting Recombinant Factor IX and VIII, respectively, in the second half of this year. We believe that both of these product candidates have the potential to offer compelling innovation and benefits to Hemophilia patients.
Along with the substantial progress I just reviewed on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken concrete steps to bolster our earlier stage development pipeline. Rebuilding the Phase I and II pipeline is a long-term strategic imperative for the company and will be accomplished by disciplined investments in internal discoveries and targeted transactions to obtain highly differentiated assets in our core focus areas.
We previously announced the global collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, targeting spinal muscular atrophy, also known as SMA. SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness, and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. One child out of every 10,000 births worldwide is born with SMA. Children with SMA generally appear normal at birth, with symptoms developing as early as a few months after birth. The most severe forms of the disease children have significant neuromuscular defects and a lifespan of approximately 2 years. Isis anti-sense therapy is designed to correct the underlying genetic defect that causes SMA. This collaboration fits with our mission of bringing innovative therapies to patients with serious neurologic diseases. I'm also pleased with the progress that the R&D team has made advancing and adding to our Phase I and II portfolio. The Anti-Lingo and relapsing MS and the Anti-TWEAK antibody and lupus nephritis programs have been approved to go to Phase II, and we expect patient dosing to start in the first half and second half of 2012, respectively.
These 2 programs are highly differentiated therapies, discovered and developed internally, and we'll have more to say about these 2 programs as Phase II dosing begins.
We've also advanced 2 additional programs from research into development in 2011. We plan to hold an R&D day this year to highlight progress in the strength in innovation of our growing early-stage pipeline. More details to follow on this event.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has shown this past quarter. Our late-stage pipeline is one of the most enviable in the industry and we're making tangible progress on building a sustainable and high-value early-stage pipeline. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."

The MS franchise continued its strong momentum into the fourth quarter as we delivered double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX continued to show resilience in the U.S. while we experienced growth ex-U.S. Worldwide, units grew 1% while revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter, capping off a solid year for the franchise and highlighting our refocused commercial execution. Despite pressure on the ABCRE market, fourth quarter U.S. AVONEX units were in line with the previous quarter, with the anticipated U.S. approval of AVONEX PEN, and for the AVONEX Titration Kit in 2012, we will continue to build upon these 2011 results.
Outside the U.S., fourth quarter units and revenues both grew 4% year-on-year, and for the full year, units gained 6%. AVONEX remains the market leader, and share growth was strong in countries where we have launched the AVONEX PEN such as the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Netherlands.
Moving to TYSABRI. We made tremendous progress with both sales performance and the advancement of risk stratification, which continues to drive interest in the brand. The JCV assay became commercially available in both the EU and U.S. last year. And as of December 31, there have been approximately 87,000 JCV tests globally, some of which are patients being tested for the second time. We believe that the majority of TYSABRI patients have now been tested for their JCV antibody status. As we saw last quarter, the very rapid uptake of the assay created uneven net new patient growth due to increased discontinuation as more patients became aware of the their JCV antibody status. At the same time, demand for TYSABRI remained robust and we remain confident that the increased interest in risk stratification will continue to drive strong demand going forward.
Full-year global units increased 16% while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 20%. Net new patients increased by 7,200 for the year, an increase of 13%.
In the U.S., fourth quarter TYSABRI units grew 10% year-on-year. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. For the full year, units grew 12%. With the recent FDA label approval that identified the antiJCV antibody status as an additional risk factor, we are now able to speak actively with neurologists and provide the MS community with more confidence when considering treatment options. Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 19% for the full year and 20% in the fourth quarter. In these markets, TYSABRI also grew 2x faster than the overall MS market growth rate, driven by both patient growth and additional country launches.
While we're still in the beginning stages of the FAMPYRA launch, we're encouraged by the early strong results. There's been pent-up demand for the therapy, and given our strong position in the MS marketplace, we continue to gain access to physician and drive additional interest. 
In Germany, we've seen strong uptake, with more than 7,000 patients exposed to FAMPYRA through year end since its launch in September 2011. This important therapy is currently available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe and regulatory filings are planned in over 20 additional countries this year.
In 2012, our focus will be to drive our existing commercial therapies, keeping the momentum we've seen in 2011 going forward. We're excited about preparing our organization for potentially multiple product launches. With the expectation of the first-half 2013 launch for BG-12, we are making investments now in product positioning, promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supply chain. We plan to build customer-facing resources later in the year.
Similarly, preparations are underway as we make investments in our Hemophilia franchise for an expected mid-2013 launch. We are new to the Hemophilia market but we've already put in place a commercial team composed of seasoned professionals with significant experience in the Hemophilia space, which we will scale up as we get closer to launch. We are developing relationships with the medical and scientific community globally and we will be leveraging our strengths in patient services.
We believe that this will offer a competitive advantage to the Hemophilia marketplace. We're making great progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple product launches in the coming years. I'm confident that we'll continue to build upon our commercial foundation and that will drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.22 in the fourth quarter and $5.04 for the full year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter include $50 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $30 million for contingent consideration and $3 million in stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51 for Q4, representing a 6% increase versus prior year, and for the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.90, representing a 15% increase. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 9% to $1.3 billion and grew 7% for the full year, surpassing $5 billion.
In the U.S., AVONEX grew 10% in Q4 to $421 million, while the full year U.S. AVONEX revenues increased 9% to $1.6 billion. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks. Internationally, Q4 AVONEX revenue was $282 million, an increase of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact this quarter. For the full year and  -- international AVONEX revenue increased 3% to  $1.1 billion.
Foreign exchange strengthened AVONEX revenue by $51 million. However, this was offset by a $31 million hedge loss as compared to a $35 million hedge gain in 2010.
TYSABRI worldwide end-market sales were $381 million in Q4 and $1.5 billion for the year, up 14% and 23%, respectively. Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI revenue of $269 million in Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year.
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 25% to $87 million. Full year TYSABRI product revenue was $326 million, an increase of 29%.
Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $182 million and $753 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were impacted by a $14 million accrual related to a discount in our Italian affiliate. We received notification from the Italian National Medicines Agency stating that the sales of TYSABRI had exceeded a limit established during our 2006 price determination. We've challenged the agency's claim. However, our fourth quarter accounting treatment has resulted in a $14 million reserve related to this issue. We hope to have resolution in the first half of 2012.
The impact of foreign exchange for full year TYSABRI added $38 million to international revenues versus prior year, which was offset by a $6 million loss from hedging compared to an $11 million hedge gain in 2010.
Note also similar to prior quarters, we've updated prior quarter TYSABRI patient numbers to reflect the best information available.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $721 million in the fourth quarter, up 4%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.9 billion, up 6% driven by an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit-sharing expense reimbursement from this business was $228 million for Q4 and $879 million for the full year. Royalties and profit share in sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q4 were $30 million and $118 million for the full year.
The result was $258 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q4 and $997 million for the full year. FAMPYRA revenue was $10 million for Q4, largely driven by Germany, but also includes sales from select European countries and Australia.
Royalties were $53 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 16%. The increase was mainly due to  hitting a new royalty tier on sales of ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. For the full year 2011, royalty revenue was $158 million, an increase of 15%.
We recorded $20 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. For 2011, we recorded $57 million of corporate partner revenue.
Now turning to expense lines from the non-GAAP P&L. Fourth quarter cost of sales were $140 million or 11% of revenues, which included increased global JC virus assay test and the increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. Fourth quarter R&D expense was $338 million or 25% of revenues, which included the $36 million payment to Portola and an increased spending related to our late-stage programs.
For the full year, R&D expense was $1.2 billion or 24% of revenues. Q4 SG&A expense was $282 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $73 million in expense for the quarter and $318 million for the year.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, benefiting from a higher level of orphan drug research credits in favorable settlements from prior-year audits. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million, essentially flat versus prior quarters.
During Q4, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total cost of $111 million for the purpose of 2012 share stabilization. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.51 in the fourth quarter and $5.90 for full year. Now let me turn to full year 2012 guidance.
We expect full-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits. Cost of sales is expected to be between 9% and 10% of sales, driven by third-party manufacturing, JC virus assay test and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. R&D is expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue, a modest increase versus 2011. The R&D spend continues to be driven by several Phase III trials, which will be at the high point of patient accruals, including PEG-Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factor trials, Daclizumab and the safety extension studies for BG-12. Additionally, in January, we initiated sites for the new pediatric studies for Factor VIII and Factor IX. R&D also reflects the recent business development deals with Portola and Isis, which are important steps to rebuilding our early-stage pipeline.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, up from 2011, primarily driven by the commercial ramp-up in preparation for the potential multiple product launches in 2013.
We expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be between 24% and 26% of pretax income. We expect the tax rate to benefit from higher orphan drug credit and also benefit from the expected conclusion in mid-2012 of the interferon beta royalty payment from our foreign affiliate to our U.S. affiliate.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $6.10 and $6.20 and GAAP EPS to be between $5.46 and $5.56. These anticipated results assume the current FX rates and exclude any material risk related to the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Also full-year EPS guidance assumes share stabilization. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out that we expect the first quarter of 2012 to be unfavorably impacted by certain items. Specifically, ANGIOMAX royalties will reset to a low revenue level in Q1 as in the past, and our R&D expenses will include the $29 million upfront payment to Isis. 
Overall, we expect 2012 to be a very important financial year. Our business plan strikes a proper balance in making prudent, pre-launch investments, continuing to build in advance to promising pipeline while delivering earnings growth. These investments by design should have a relatively quick and meaningful put payback, poising our company for future bottom-line expansion.

We are facing on a country-by-country basis in Europe, somewhat of a repeat of that in the later part of 2011 into early 2012. So I think that's what you've seen. If the U.S. experience plays out, we're confident that those numbers will recover because we see more demand for the product after you get through that initial discount.

I mean, if the results are compelling, I think it's really not too much else for these patients except for Riluzole, which has a very, very modest treatment effect. So I think a lot of patients would probably opt to go on the drug.

It's -- you know what is true is that the $300 million in savings that we achieved are still there, they're in there. We are in a year now when our clinical -- our late-stage clinical trial enrollment is likely at its maximum points. As Paul went through in his statement, PEGylated Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factors, daclizumab, the safety extension studies for BG-12 are all at their peak. And so a large fraction of our R&D dollars, now way over half of our R&D dollars, is going just to pay for those trial. They enrolled more quickly than we had anticipated, which means we got up to the maximum costs more quickly than we had anticipated. And frankly, as you think about the company going forward, you expect to have some attrition. And that's the normal. We didn't have any. And failure is cheap and success costs money, and so we are paying for those trials. At the same time, because we know the data for BG-12, and we are, let's say, preparing and optimistic about Factor VIII and IX, we're spending substantially -- let's say, substantial amount of resources to prepare for the launches of those products. You can look at many of the product launches that have been done recently. Some of them have gone well, some of them haven't. And we need to make sure we get ours right, and that takes some preparation. And so we're spending on those as well. So we have -- I think, there's a difference in spend where you are inefficient and wasting money. Not spending adequately on the commercial preparation would be foolish savings. So we're not, not doing that. We're spending, I think, prudently and thoughtfully, but we are investing appropriately. And we are, I guess, saddled with a lot of Phase III costs, which is, in the end, a good thing. But this is the year when I think all those are maximized."

And this year, where we have all the late-stage trials to invest in, we have to invest in them. And that's really what's causing R&D budget to be higher. And those will naturally come to an end and the cost will taper down and R&D costs will come down. And assuming that our early-stage pipeline develops along normal metrics, yes, it'll probably come down to that number you said. If the pipeline is less successful than we hoped, it could be lower. If it's more successful than we hoped, it could be somewhat higher. But I think that's a reasonable target."

Yes, the guidance for 2012 shows a little bit of improvement vis-à-vis our last few years of guidance. And that's a couple of factors. The orphan drug programs that we have, specifically Factor VIII, Factor IX, dex, all have this ability to capture orphan drug research credits, which over the long haul, it depends on the shape of programs kind of coming forward that may kind of apply for that. Isis would be one that would. But that is a number of years off. Additionally, what I had noted is that outside the United States, we have heretofore had a royalty payment that is paid from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. affiliate that will end in mid-2012. So that is sustainable going forward. Over the longer term, I think that all in all, there's downward pressure on our effective tax rate as BG-12 becomes a greater part of our profit mix. And conversely, the RITUXAN cash flow that is subject to essentially all U.S. taxes becomes a lower percentage of our profit mix. Both of those are probably offset by the fact that we intend to do or continue to do cost sharing on programs. So we intend to still -- which has the effect of -- for a portion of R&D not capturing some tax deduction on those expenses. But all told, I think it's a modestly favorable story over the next couple of years and a good story over the longer term."

Yes, I think the other reason it ticked up a little bit was we had a little bit more than normal write-offs in Q4 of 2011. Most of those write-offs were excess in obsolescence write-offs related to ZEVALIN. So we have actually a supply agreement that is, obviously, a number of years old related to the divested product and just literally because the end market sales have attenuated there. We've had to take a write-off in Q4. We think that is for the most part, behind us. Our yields across the plant have been on track. And then I think the other thing going into 2012 is that we will benefit a little bit from a more productive, if you will, biologics manufacturing going back in late 2009 and into 2010. So I mean, curiously, our productivity in a given year benefits the P&L a number of years down the line simply because of the inventory balances that we hold in this business. We will continue to have costs that are related to the assay that we do think that are very important, particularly at this stage of TYSABRI and in risk stratification to be behind the brand. There's an opportunity for improvement if we can get that reimbursed in the United States, because currently we and Elan bear the burden of that on the P&L. As you had inferred that as RITUXAN may become lower percentage of the mix, that has a very favorable gross margin obviously. But I think the products that come on also are pretty strong gross margins, kind of BG-12, et cetera.

We had a very productive fourth quarter and -- which concluded a really, I think, great year for Biogen Idec. Recall that in 2011, our goals were to deliver double-digit EPS growth, grow AVONEX and TYSABRI share while pursuing the serological assay and risk stratification to further unlock the value of TYSABRI, advance our late stage pipeline and continue to drive cultural change. We delivered on all these goals and we've run a long way towards building a foundation for long term growth for Biogen Idec. 
In 2011, our product -- total product revenues were up 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS ended the year at $5.90, a 15% increase over 2010. In 2011, our AVONEX commercial team substantially improved the business and AVONEX global sales reached $2.7 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year.
We introduced the AVONEX PEN to the European markets and Canada, thereby improving the administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest and we filed for marketing authorization of the AVONEX PEN in the U.S.
TYSABRI end-market sales grew 23% year-over-year to reach $1.5 billion in 2011, and we hit key milestones that are important for unlocking the value of TYSABRI. First, the assay for JC virus antibodies was made broadly available in both the U.S. and the EU. Second, the TYSABRI product label was updated in both the EU and the U.S. to include JC virus antibody status as a risk factor for the development of PML.
There's been tremendous interest from the MS community in risk stratification and we believe that the large majority of TYSABRI patients now know their antibody status and that increasing numbers of patients considering TYSABRI are being tested as well.
Against long odds, we were able to convince the EMA to reverse their initially negative opinion for FAMPYRA and we obtained conditional EU marketing approval. We launched FAMPYRA in Germany in 2011 and plan additional launches this year.
Turning to R&D, our late-stage pipeline advanced substantially in 2011, led obviously by BG-12, but also including significant advances in many other portfolio compounds, both early and late. As you know, BG-12 data in 2 large clinical trials were very encouraging. These 2 clinical trials, with more than 2,600 patients, represent the largest data set for any new drug in relapsing-remitting MS to date. We're now focused on bringing this potentially major new therapy to patients with MS as soon as possible.
SELECT, the first of 2 registrational trials for Daclizumab, showed impressive clinical results in 2011 and supported the continuation of the second registrational study, DECIDE. We also completed enrollment for ADVANCE, our Phase III trial, evaluating once monthly subcutaneous PEGylated Interferon for relapsing-remitting MS, and we completed enrollment for EMPOWER, the first global Phase III study of dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
Turning to our Hemophilia programs, Phase I/II data were presented for our Long-Lasting Factor VIII product in Kyoto candidate [ph] in Japan in 2011, addressing an important unmet need in the Hemophilia community, where less frequent injections will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes for patients.
Our Phase III trials continued to enroll successfully during the year. In fact, our clinical trial enrollment improved so much during the year that we substantially overspent our budget for these trials. That, of course, is a good over-expenditure that resulted from improved execution. In 2011, we were able to meet or exceed our enrollment targets for almost everyone of our clinical trials.
And I'd like to point out that even with these additional clinical expenses, we surpassed our earnings target. As part of our goal to drive cultural change and reinvigorate R&D, we focused on the areas where we have the most expertise and where we have the most promising assets: neurology, immunology and Hemophilia. We increased our efforts to move internal programs forward and looked for new high-quality assets to grow our early-stage pipeline.
We successfully advanced our Anti-Lingo program in relapsing MS, as well as our Anti-TWEAK program for lupus nephritis. We announced the  collaboration with Portola Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize an oral, highly selective Syk Inhibitor and with ISIS for compounds to target spinal muscular atrophy. We also announced the joint venture with Samsung for the development of Biosimilars, leveraging our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities while allowing us to remain focus -- maintain focus on discovering, developing and delivering innovative new therapies for patients.
Because of our successes in 2011, we've entered 2012 with a lot to do. We'll continue to focus on execution as we invest in our future success. Our goals for this year are to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market shares, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue. We'll invest significantly to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include successful regulatory filings for BG-12 this year and the appropriate ramp-up of commercial and medical capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches.
2012 is a building year for Biogen Idec. All of these activities, of course, take substantial resources. Additionally, we'll continue to build our early-stage pipeline and continue our focus on culture. I'm pleased to say that we expect to accomplish this year of building and preparation for product launches while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams, our Executive VP of R&D."
29726,145982448,213322,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.During Q4, we co",1098,"Thanks, George. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D organization for all their efforts and success in 2011. It's been a year of significant accomplishments, spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.
During Q4, we continued to make considerable progress on several aspects of our late stage R&D programs, which positions the company to launch a series of meaningful new drugs, addressing significant unmet medical needs for patients and positioning the company for future revenue growth.
Let me recap progress in Q4, starting with our MS pipeline. Earlier this month, we announced that the FDA approved a product label change for TYSABRI, which identifies antiJCV antibody status as a risk factor for developing PML. This is the third distinct risk factor identified, and reflects our commitment to providing important benefit risk information to treating physicians and their patients when considering TYSABRI as a treatment option.
Infection with the JC virus is required for the development of PML, and patients who are antiJCV antibody positive, therefore, have a greater risk of developing PML.
Moving on to BG-12, the team is aggressively working on regulatory submissions for BG-12 and we plan to file with the FDA and EMA in the first half of this year. The profile of BG-12 seen in the DEFINE and CONFIRM Phase III studies indicates a favorable benefit risk profile for this drug with the convenience of oral dosing. While we conducted the Phase III studies with the formulation administered as 2 capsules twice or 3 times a day, we have since completed a bioequivalent study for 1 capsule formulation, which could allow for 1 capsule twice a day. We plan to also include this new formulation as part of the filing.
ADVANCE, the Phase III registrational study of PEG-Interferon and 1,500 patients with relapsing-remitting MS completed enrollment in Q4. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA with an annualized relapse rate at 1 year as the primary endpoint. We anticipate top-line data to be available in early 2013.
In the U.S., we've also focused on providing a better patient experience with the AVONEX PEN and the AVONEX Titration Kit to make self-administration more convenient and to help reduce flu-like symptoms at the outset of therapy. The PDUFA date for both the AVONEX PEN and the Titration Kit is in the first half of this year.
Turning to the rest of our neurology pipeline. Top-line data for the EMPOWER study, the first Phase III study of dexpramipexole and ALS is anticipated in the second half of 2012. Dex is a novel, oral compound that appears to have neuroprotective properties based on experimental and preclinical studies and may slow the loss of motor neuron function by improving mitochondrial energy utilization. EMPOWER, which has been conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment approved by the FDA, utilizes a novel primary endpoint, which combines survival and functional decline. The Phase II results of dex published in Nature Medicine in November of last year, was the first positive dose-ranging study of a new agent in ALS in nearly 15 years. In this study, the combined endpoint of survival and functional decline was statistically significant when comparing low versus high doses of dex. Our current plans are to initiate endeavor, the second Phase III study of dexpramipexole, which incorporates higher drug doses subsequent to the EMPOWER data readout. This will allow us to incorporate any learnings from EMPOWER into the endeavor design. I want to clarify that the EMPOWER study is ongoing, and thus, remains blinded. We're not making the change in the second trial timing due to any knowledge or speculation about EMPOWER or due to any other signals, but rather as a way of optimizing the overall data set from the 2 clinical studies.
Moving on to our Hemophilia programs. Enrollment is nearly complete in our A-LONG study. We're dosing the last nonsurgical patients now, and we'll continue to enroll surgery patients through the first half of the year. We expect top-line data readout for both B-LONG and A-LONG studies for Long-Lasting Recombinant Factor IX and VIII, respectively, in the second half of this year. We believe that both of these product candidates have the potential to offer compelling innovation and benefits to Hemophilia patients.
Along with the substantial progress I just reviewed on our late-stage clinical programs, we've also taken concrete steps to bolster our earlier stage development pipeline. Rebuilding the Phase I and II pipeline is a long-term strategic imperative for the company and will be accomplished by disciplined investments in internal discoveries and targeted transactions to obtain highly differentiated assets in our core focus areas.
We previously announced the global collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, targeting spinal muscular atrophy, also known as SMA. SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness, and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. One child out of every 10,000 births worldwide is born with SMA. Children with SMA generally appear normal at birth, with symptoms developing as early as a few months after birth. The most severe forms of the disease children have significant neuromuscular defects and a lifespan of approximately 2 years. Isis anti-sense therapy is designed to correct the underlying genetic defect that causes SMA. This collaboration fits with our mission of bringing innovative therapies to patients with serious neurologic diseases. I'm also pleased with the progress that the R&D team has made advancing and adding to our Phase I and II portfolio. The Anti-Lingo and relapsing MS and the Anti-TWEAK antibody and lupus nephritis programs have been approved to go to Phase II, and we expect patient dosing to start in the first half and second half of 2012, respectively.
These 2 programs are highly differentiated therapies, discovered and developed internally, and we'll have more to say about these 2 programs as Phase II dosing begins.
We've also advanced 2 additional programs from research into development in 2011. We plan to hold an R&D day this year to highlight progress in the strength in innovation of our growing early-stage pipeline. More details to follow on this event.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has shown this past quarter. Our late-stage pipeline is one of the most enviable in the industry and we're making tangible progress on building a sustainable and high-value early-stage pipeline. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations."

The MS franchise continued its strong momentum into the fourth quarter as we delivered double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX continued to show resilience in the U.S. while we experienced growth ex-U.S. Worldwide, units grew 1% while revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter, capping off a solid year for the franchise and highlighting our refocused commercial execution. Despite pressure on the ABCRE market, fourth quarter U.S. AVONEX units were in line with the previous quarter, with the anticipated U.S. approval of AVONEX PEN, and for the AVONEX Titration Kit in 2012, we will continue to build upon these 2011 results.
Outside the U.S., fourth quarter units and revenues both grew 4% year-on-year, and for the full year, units gained 6%. AVONEX remains the market leader, and share growth was strong in countries where we have launched the AVONEX PEN such as the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Netherlands.
Moving to TYSABRI. We made tremendous progress with both sales performance and the advancement of risk stratification, which continues to drive interest in the brand. The JCV assay became commercially available in both the EU and U.S. last year. And as of December 31, there have been approximately 87,000 JCV tests globally, some of which are patients being tested for the second time. We believe that the majority of TYSABRI patients have now been tested for their JCV antibody status. As we saw last quarter, the very rapid uptake of the assay created uneven net new patient growth due to increased discontinuation as more patients became aware of the their JCV antibody status. At the same time, demand for TYSABRI remained robust and we remain confident that the increased interest in risk stratification will continue to drive strong demand going forward.
Full-year global units increased 16% while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 20%. Net new patients increased by 7,200 for the year, an increase of 13%.
In the U.S., fourth quarter TYSABRI units grew 10% year-on-year. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. For the full year, units grew 12%. With the recent FDA label approval that identified the antiJCV antibody status as an additional risk factor, we are now able to speak actively with neurologists and provide the MS community with more confidence when considering treatment options. Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 19% for the full year and 20% in the fourth quarter. In these markets, TYSABRI also grew 2x faster than the overall MS market growth rate, driven by both patient growth and additional country launches.
While we're still in the beginning stages of the FAMPYRA launch, we're encouraged by the early strong results. There's been pent-up demand for the therapy, and given our strong position in the MS marketplace, we continue to gain access to physician and drive additional interest. 
In Germany, we've seen strong uptake, with more than 7,000 patients exposed to FAMPYRA through year end since its launch in September 2011. This important therapy is currently available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Additional launch preparation is underway for the rest of Europe and regulatory filings are planned in over 20 additional countries this year.
In 2012, our focus will be to drive our existing commercial therapies, keeping the momentum we've seen in 2011 going forward. We're excited about preparing our organization for potentially multiple product launches. With the expectation of the first-half 2013 launch for BG-12, we are making investments now in product positioning, promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supply chain. We plan to build customer-facing resources later in the year.
Similarly, preparations are underway as we make investments in our Hemophilia franchise for an expected mid-2013 launch. We are new to the Hemophilia market but we've already put in place a commercial team composed of seasoned professionals with significant experience in the Hemophilia space, which we will scale up as we get closer to launch. We are developing relationships with the medical and scientific community globally and we will be leveraging our strengths in patient services.
We believe that this will offer a competitive advantage to the Hemophilia marketplace. We're making great progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple product launches in the coming years. I'm confident that we'll continue to build upon our commercial foundation and that will drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.22 in the fourth quarter and $5.04 for the full year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter include $50 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $30 million for contingent consideration and $3 million in stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51 for Q4, representing a 6% increase versus prior year, and for the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.90, representing a 15% increase. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 9% to $1.3 billion and grew 7% for the full year, surpassing $5 billion.
In the U.S., AVONEX grew 10% in Q4 to $421 million, while the full year U.S. AVONEX revenues increased 9% to $1.6 billion. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.3 weeks. Internationally, Q4 AVONEX revenue was $282 million, an increase of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact this quarter. For the full year and  -- international AVONEX revenue increased 3% to  $1.1 billion.
Foreign exchange strengthened AVONEX revenue by $51 million. However, this was offset by a $31 million hedge loss as compared to a $35 million hedge gain in 2010.
TYSABRI worldwide end-market sales were $381 million in Q4 and $1.5 billion for the year, up 14% and 23%, respectively. Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI revenue of $269 million in Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year.
In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 25% to $87 million. Full year TYSABRI product revenue was $326 million, an increase of 29%.
Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $182 million and $753 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were impacted by a $14 million accrual related to a discount in our Italian affiliate. We received notification from the Italian National Medicines Agency stating that the sales of TYSABRI had exceeded a limit established during our 2006 price determination. We've challenged the agency's claim. However, our fourth quarter accounting treatment has resulted in a $14 million reserve related to this issue. We hope to have resolution in the first half of 2012.
The impact of foreign exchange for full year TYSABRI added $38 million to international revenues versus prior year, which was offset by a $6 million loss from hedging compared to an $11 million hedge gain in 2010.
Note also similar to prior quarters, we've updated prior quarter TYSABRI patient numbers to reflect the best information available.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $721 million in the fourth quarter, up 4%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $2.9 billion, up 6% driven by an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL and continued uptake in CLL. Our profit-sharing expense reimbursement from this business was $228 million for Q4 and $879 million for the full year. Royalties and profit share in sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q4 were $30 million and $118 million for the full year.
The result was $258 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q4 and $997 million for the full year. FAMPYRA revenue was $10 million for Q4, largely driven by Germany, but also includes sales from select European countries and Australia.
Royalties were $53 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 16%. The increase was mainly due to  hitting a new royalty tier on sales of ANGIOMAX. This new tier is applied to all year-to-date revenue in our accounting model. For the full year 2011, royalty revenue was $158 million, an increase of 15%.
We recorded $20 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter, driven by third-party manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. For 2011, we recorded $57 million of corporate partner revenue.
Now turning to expense lines from the non-GAAP P&L. Fourth quarter cost of sales were $140 million or 11% of revenues, which included increased global JC virus assay test and the increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. Fourth quarter R&D expense was $338 million or 25% of revenues, which included the $36 million payment to Portola and an increased spending related to our late-stage programs.
For the full year, R&D expense was $1.2 billion or 24% of revenues. Q4 SG&A expense was $282 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $73 million in expense for the quarter and $318 million for the year.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, benefiting from a higher level of orphan drug research credits in favorable settlements from prior-year audits. In the fourth quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 245 million, essentially flat versus prior quarters.
During Q4, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total cost of $111 million for the purpose of 2012 share stabilization. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.51 in the fourth quarter and $5.90 for full year. Now let me turn to full year 2012 guidance.
We expect full-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits. Cost of sales is expected to be between 9% and 10% of sales, driven by third-party manufacturing, JC virus assay test and increased costs for the AVONEX PEN. R&D is expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue, a modest increase versus 2011. The R&D spend continues to be driven by several Phase III trials, which will be at the high point of patient accruals, including PEG-Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factor trials, Daclizumab and the safety extension studies for BG-12. Additionally, in January, we initiated sites for the new pediatric studies for Factor VIII and Factor IX. R&D also reflects the recent business development deals with Portola and Isis, which are important steps to rebuilding our early-stage pipeline.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, up from 2011, primarily driven by the commercial ramp-up in preparation for the potential multiple product launches in 2013.
We expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be between 24% and 26% of pretax income. We expect the tax rate to benefit from higher orphan drug credit and also benefit from the expected conclusion in mid-2012 of the interferon beta royalty payment from our foreign affiliate to our U.S. affiliate.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $6.10 and $6.20 and GAAP EPS to be between $5.46 and $5.56. These anticipated results assume the current FX rates and exclude any material risk related to the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Also full-year EPS guidance assumes share stabilization. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to call out that we expect the first quarter of 2012 to be unfavorably impacted by certain items. Specifically, ANGIOMAX royalties will reset to a low revenue level in Q1 as in the past, and our R&D expenses will include the $29 million upfront payment to Isis. 
Overall, we expect 2012 to be a very important financial year. Our business plan strikes a proper balance in making prudent, pre-launch investments, continuing to build in advance to promising pipeline while delivering earnings growth. These investments by design should have a relatively quick and meaningful put payback, poising our company for future bottom-line expansion.

We are facing on a country-by-country basis in Europe, somewhat of a repeat of that in the later part of 2011 into early 2012. So I think that's what you've seen. If the U.S. experience plays out, we're confident that those numbers will recover because we see more demand for the product after you get through that initial discount.

I mean, if the results are compelling, I think it's really not too much else for these patients except for Riluzole, which has a very, very modest treatment effect. So I think a lot of patients would probably opt to go on the drug. Remember that when we opened enrollment in this trial, the interest was so high that we enrolled patients in record speed and we completed enrollment far ahead of schedule.

I think your plan was to improve strategic focus, deliver $300 million in savings and 350 basis points improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. But if I look at the midpoint of the guidance range for 2012, we're looking at 47% of revenues going to SG&A and R&D, which is about, in my calculation, is 40 -- about 40 basis points better than 2010.

It's -- you know what is true is that the $300 million in savings that we achieved are still there, they're in there. We are in a year now when our clinical -- our late-stage clinical trial enrollment is likely at its maximum points. As Paul went through in his statement, PEGylated Interferon, dexpramipexole, the 2 blood factors, daclizumab, the safety extension studies for BG-12 are all at their peak. And so a large fraction of our R&D dollars, now way over half of our R&D dollars, is going just to pay for those trial. They enrolled more quickly than we had anticipated, which means we got up to the maximum costs more quickly than we had anticipated. And frankly, as you think about the company going forward, you expect to have some attrition. And that's the normal. We didn't have any. And failure is cheap and success costs money, and so we are paying for those trials. At the same time, because we know the data for BG-12, and we are, let's say, preparing and optimistic about Factor VIII and IX, we're spending substantially -- let's say, substantial amount of resources to prepare for the launches of those products. You can look at many of the product launches that have been done recently. Some of them have gone well, some of them haven't. And we need to make sure we get ours right, and that takes some preparation. And so we're spending on those as well. So we have -- I think, there's a difference in spend where you are inefficient and wasting money. Not spending adequately on the commercial preparation would be foolish savings. So we're not, not doing that. We're spending, I think, prudently and thoughtfully, but we are investing appropriately. And we are, I guess, saddled with a lot of Phase III costs, which is, in the end, a good thing. But this is the year when I think all those are maximized."

And those will naturally come to an end and the cost will taper down and R&D costs will come down. And assuming that our early-stage pipeline develops along normal metrics, yes, it'll probably come down to that number you said. If the pipeline is less successful than we hoped, it could be lower.

Yes, the guidance for 2012 shows a little bit of improvement vis-à-vis our last few years of guidance. And that's a couple of factors. The orphan drug programs that we have, specifically Factor VIII, Factor IX, dex, all have this ability to capture orphan drug research credits, which over the long haul, it depends on the shape of programs kind of coming forward that may kind of apply for that. Isis would be one that would. But that is a number of years off. Additionally, what I had noted is that outside the United States, we have heretofore had a royalty payment that is paid from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. affiliate that will end in mid-2012. So that is sustainable going forward. Over the longer term, I think that all in all, there's downward pressure on our effective tax rate as BG-12 becomes a greater part of our profit mix. And conversely, the RITUXAN cash flow that is subject to essentially all U.S. taxes becomes a lower percentage of our profit mix. Both of those are probably offset by the fact that we intend to do or continue to do cost sharing on programs. So we intend to still -- which has the effect of -- for a portion of R&D not capturing some tax deduction on those expenses. But all told, I think it's a modestly favorable story over the next couple of years and a good story over the longer term."

We've had to take a write-off in Q4. We think that is for the most part, behind us. Our yields across the plant have been on track. And then I think the other thing going into 2012 is that we will benefit a little bit from a more productive, if you will, biologics manufacturing going back in late 2009 and into 2010. So I mean, curiously, our productivity in a given year benefits the P&L a number of years down the line simply because of the inventory balances that we hold in this business. We will continue to have costs that are related to the assay that we do think that are very important, particularly at this stage of TYSABRI and in risk stratification to be behind the brand. There's an opportunity for improvement if we can get that reimbursed in the United States, because currently we and Elan bear the burden of that on the P&L. As you had inferred that as RITUXAN may become lower percentage of the mix, that has a very favorable gross margin obviously.

Just if you could help us reconcile the different numbers on the cumulative TYSABRI patient count. So what is in your slides today is 95,200 as of the end of December, but in the FDA communication, when the JC virus assay was approved, they had mentioned 96,582 as of January 4. And I thought that maybe I was getting confused and it was the clinical trial patient numbers that was throwing things off. But then you mentioned today that, that number is 4,700. So I'm actually not sure what the disconnect there is and maybe if you could help us understand that a little bit better?"

Look, we always go back at this point in every quarter and try to, particularly on the international TYSABRI patient numbers, reflect the best of information available that generally will move numbers around a not very meaningful amount. That probably is the biggest reason for the change vis-à-vis the January 4 medical communication. We'll look into and try to get back to you if there's anything further than that. But I believe it's owing to, in essence, the international numbers. The U.S. numbers aren't subject to a lot of changes because of the TOUCH program. We have a tremendous amount of visibility so we don't see a lot of changes in that. It's just that country by country, there are different methodologies that we use on the TYSABRI patient numbers and we always try to look hard and quality-control those to try to get the best information available."

By now, I'm sure that most of you had a chance to review our press release for the first quarter of 2012. We reported revenue growth of 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. 
While most of our performance measures met or exceeded expectations, the EPS number, of course, is below the external estimates, although it is in line with our internal estimates. While every quarter includes a lot of gives and takes, this quarter was a bit more complicated than usual. The bottom line notice that AVONEX orders were below expectations in January and without this factor, we would have met the external estimates, even with a significant investment for the future that we may during the quarter. 
So the question is whether or not there's an underlying issue with the AVONEX business or whether there were isolated factors that contributed to the January results, and the answer is basically good use. We believe that the fundamental for AVONEX remains solid and that they January revenues were the result of isolated events, which we'll go into a little later in the call. 
While we're not satisfied with this events, we're heartened by the fact that AVONEX sales rebounded quickly with both revenues and units on track in February and March. 
So let me now turn to the many positive aspects of the quarter. Both TYSABRI and RITUXAN delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q1, and TYSABRI was particularly strong with 14% year-over-year growth. 
TYSABRI net patient adds continue to show strength, as we begin to roll out risk stratification based and JC virus antibody status to the neurology community. Patuxent also had a strong quarter and sales of Emperia in EU were encouraging. All of these aspects of courts are positive and with AVONEX back on track, we're quite optimistic about the full year. Paul will go into the details, but I just want say here that we believe we're now on track to achieve in EPS of this year of greater than $6.15. 
During the first quarter, we achieved a number of very important product and pipeline milestones. The AVONEX PEN was approved in the U.S. and launched last week, improving AVONEX administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest. 
We simultaneously received approval for the Titration Kit, known as AVOSTARTGRIP, which will help reduce the incidence and severity of flulike symptoms for new AVONEX patients. We gained FDA approval to include the JC virus antibody status, as part of risk stratification for PML in the U.S. TYSABRI label. This change allows the sales force to talk to physicians and health care professionals about all 3 factors of risk stratification, which is a very important step towards realizing the full potential of this therapy. 
At the American Academy of Neurology meeting lastly, our pipeline was the subject of 49 platform presentations and posters, including new data for TYSABRI, BG-12, FAMPYRA, Daclizumab, dexpramipexole and Anti-Lingo. 
We were able to present the full data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, and highlight efficacy and safety data for the program. The ANN and also provides a platform for us to showcase the AVONEX and situation kit for the U.S. market. We made further progress this quarter ongoing our early-stage pipeline with the acquisition of Stromedix, thereby adding to our pipeline a noble full humanized monoclonal antibody for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPS. 
IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which they patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to discard of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe have IPF, and there is a high end met need for Battig therapies for these patients. 
Adding to our early-stage pipeline, we entered the collaboration with Isis earlier this quarter under which our companies will develop and commercialized Isis anti-cents investigational drug for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy or SMA. 
SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness and it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. And of course, most notably, we submitted applications for marketing approval of BG-12 in the U.S. and the EU this quarter, ahead of our internal target. 
And I'd like to thank the BG-12 team and the many people of Biogen Idec who worked many hours to make this happen. Our EU application had been validated by the EMA and is formally under review. Has most of you know, a couple of months have passed since we passed the BG-12 NDA with the FDA. All of our interactions with agency to date, including recent conversations, have led us to believe that our application is on track and will be accepted with standard review. 
We anticipate a confirmatory letter of acceptance within a couple of weeks. We continue to make progress in our clinical programs as well. Factor VIII, Factor IX and dexpramipexole is on track for data readouts later this year, and Peggy for a readout in the first part of next year. 
So all in all, a very productive quarter for product and pipeline accomplishments. So let me now turn the call over to Doug Williams, Head of R&D, and I'll come back at the end for the concluding comments."

During Q1, we continue to make progress on several aspects of our R&D programs, starting with important advances on the regulatory front. 
This quarter, the FDA approved the AVONEX PEN, the first intramuscular auto injector, and simultaneously approved AVOSTARTGRIP, a new dose Tatian regimen. As you know, we submitted BG-12 for marketing approval with the FDA and EMA earlier this year. As George indicated, we believe we are on track with the U.S. review process and expect a confirmatory letter in the coming weeks stating that our NDA has been accepted. 
In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is validated by Biogen Idec's marketing authorization application for a review of BG-12 in the European Union, and we recently filed for marketing approval of BG-12 in Canada and Switzerland. 
The NDA filing for BG-12 was the largest Biogen Idec has done to date, and it was the commitment of many dedicated people that made this happen. We continue to move closer to making this potential new oral treatment for NMS available for patients. 
Last week, important data on our neurology franchise were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline was demonstrated with 49 company sponsored platform and poster presentations. 
We shared comprehensive data for CONFIRM, the second registrational study of BG-12, at 3 platform presentations. Results from CONFIRM showed that BG-12 demonstrated strong efficacy across a variety of measures, including annualized relapse rate, and also met MRI endpoints in a cohort a patients, demonstrating a significant effect on these measures of disease activity. 
In a platform presentation focused on the safety profile of BG-12 and CONFIRM, both dose regimens of BG-12 showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles, which were consistent with those seen in DEFINE. The incidence of serious infection was slow and balanced across the study groups and there were no opportunistic infections. There were no malignancy seen in the BG-12 arms at CONFIRM. While there was one malignancy seen in the placebo and 4 malignancy seen in the German acetate friends of the trial. The most common side effects for BG-12 were flushing and GI events, which decreased substantially after the first month and resulted in a low incidence of discontinuations. 
Lastly, the poster presentation of a Phase I study of BG-12 in combination with aspirin in healthy volunteers demonstrated that the PK profile of BG-12 was not affected by aspirin and that pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of BG-12-related flushing without any adverse impact on G.I. symptoms. 
Turning to TYSABRI. 14 posters and presentations were presented at this year's AAN meeting, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the EMS market. The initial data from the TYSABRI observational program, or TOP, indicated that patients experienced significantly reduced annualized relapse rates after 4 years of treatment with TYSABRI and the level of disability progression, as measured by EDSS, remains stable over time. 
Additionally, interim results for the ongoing stratified 2 trial supported what has been seeing in other clinical research, where the overall antiJCV antibody prevalence among MS patients was approximately 50% to 60%. Recall that the primary objective of stratified 2 is to demonstrate prospectively that the PML risk in TYSABRI-treated patients were antiJCV antibody negative is lower than the PML risk in patients who are antiJCV antibody positive. An interim analysis conducted the data collected as of February 2012 showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of PML in antiJCV antibody negative versus positive patients. 
Stratified 2 also showed that anti-JCB antibody prevalence was lower in females than males and increased with age. Treatment with TYSABRI did not appear to affect patients antiJCV antibody status. 
Initial findings from the synergies study, a 12-month trial looking at MS-related fatigue in patients with relapsing remitting MS, showed that TYSABRI treatment was associated with improved MS-related fatigue. This result was very important as 50% to 60% of MS patients report fatigue is one of their most disabling symptoms, which can contribute to both cognitive and physical difficulties. 
We also presented further details of the daclizumab SELECT trial in the scientific program highlights plenary session, as well as the baseline features of the empower study, our first Phase III clinical trial of DAC spread axle for patients with ALS. 
Since the design of EMPOWER and the entry criteria are the scenes as the Phase II trial, we're hopeful that we can replicate the results we saw in that study. 
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline. We presented data from 2 Phase I studies of anti-lingo monoclonal antibody or BIIB 33 that has been showed an animal mode is to promote remyelination and Exxon survival. The first Phase I study was a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, while the second study was a multiple ascending dose study in patients with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS. Primary endpoints for both studies with the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as other safety evaluations. 
Secondary end points for both studies included several measures of serum and cf levels of BIIB 33. They're presented indicated that single and multiple doses of BIIB 33 appear to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and subjects with MS, and that CSF levels achieved were in the predicted range needed for efficacy, based on animal models of remyelination. 
Importantly, the result supported advancing the development of the agent into Phase II proof of concept studies, which we expect to initiate in the second half of 2012. 
Moving onto other early-stage compounds in our portfolio. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made expanding our early-stage pipeline this quarter. Through the recent acquisition of Stromedix, we added STX-100, on noble humanized monoclonal antibody that disrupts the TGF data signaling pathways, specifically in tissues where fibrotic changes are occurring. 
We're excited about STX-100 because it exhibited significant activity in preclinical animal models of fibrotic disease and demonstrated an attracted safety and tolerability profile in the Phase I program. 
Stromedix is also identified as series of pathways specific biomarkers in the long to inform to selection of STX-100 for proof of concept studies. Molecule has potential in several additional fibrotic indications, given that selective mechanism of action and the central role of TGF-beta in fibrosis. We expect to initiate the Phase II study in IPF by midyear. 
This quarter, we also began dosing patients in the Phase I program for ISIS-SMN for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and expect to see results late in 2013. 
As we move forward into 2012, I look forward to providing you key top line data readouts from 3 pivotal trials in the second half of this year, namely the a long study of A long-lasting recovenant Factor VIII in Hemophilia A patients, the B-LONG study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor IX in Hemophelia B patients in the second half of 2012. And finally, the data readout from an power, the first study of dexpramipexole and ALS is expected to in the fourth quarter of this year. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our EVP of Global Commercial Operations."

AVONEX continues to show resilience, and we believe our strategy of focusing on frontline execution to drive share gains within the ABC or E-Class is succeeding, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
In the U.S., unfavorable channel dynamics drove lower-than-anticipated unit shipments. We'll walk you through the channel integrated detail shortly. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, as the AVONEX bank continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Netherlands. 
Last week, we introduced the AVONEX spend and AVOSTARTGRIP in the U.S. market. We believe these new divisions will help drive additional interest and allow for greater share of voice within the ABCRE market segments. The benefits of once weekly treatment in the importance of staying on the therapy make AVONEX PEN an attractive option for patients. This message is driving share growth in countries where we've launched the PEN, and we believe we are poised to experience similar success in the U.S. market. 
Moving onto TYSABRI. First quarter, global TYSABRI units increased 18%, while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 14% versus prior year. In the U.S., first quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. 
Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 24% in the first quarter versus prior year. We saw positive patient trends during the first quarter, as we added over 1,900 net new patients. Commercially, we continue to drive TYSABRI strong efficacy message used the as to build physician confidence with TYSABRI risk-benefit profile and move the product early in the treatment paradigm. 
Based on the U.S. data, discontinuation rates remain stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms increased at their highest level since 2008. TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients have historically been a low single-digit percentage, but rate in the high single-digits this quarter. This provides us confidence our commercial strategy is succeeding. 
We continue to believe TYSABRI's growth may see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, but we remain confident in an overall solid growth trajectory. 
The FAMPYRA launch continues to progress as planned, as the product became commercially available in Canada last month. This innovative therapy is also available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. 
We are actively working with government agencies across Europe to achieve favorable reimbursement. We expect feedback to publish from IQWIG tomorrow, which is the next step in the German process. 
At the same time, our team continues to drive awareness in the patient physician communities, which is leading to healthy patient demand. In addition to showcasing our world-class scientific research during a and lastly, the significant foot traffic at our booth during the conference was an indicator of physician interest in our recently introduced innovation such as AVONEX, penetrate Tatian kit and other commercial products. 
We are also making significant progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple potential product launches in the coming years. We expect an early 2013 launch for BG-12 and 2 launches in Hemophilia in 2013. 
As mentioned last quarter, we continue to make investments in product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supply chain. These developments, in addition to this drug patient demand in TYSABRI seen during the quarter, demonstrates our commitment and ability to drive longer-term commercial results, and we look forward to building upon this encouraging progress.

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of our acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.40. We had expected the first quarter to be impacted by the ENG MAX royalty stepping down and the $29 million payment to Isis. So while we need to overcome the shortfall in AVONEX in Q1, we are on track for a full year financial plan. 
Let me now walk down the P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 7% to $1.3 billion. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 3% to $401 million. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.2 weeks of slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. U.S. unit volumes was down 8% versus both prior year in last quarter. 
As George noted, our AVONEX U.S. business was unfavorably impacted by what we believe were temporary channel related headwinds as ongoing patient metrics remain solid. We believe that a few pharmacy wholesalers, which are downstream from our customers, had very soft purchases in January presumably the result of advanced purchases in the fourth quarter. There was also a transition from a clear to CVS Caremark to serve as a federal play program prescription benefit. With this transitioned Caremark build up inventory last quarter while wound down inventory in Q1. 
While January often experience a modest channel swings, this year the impact was exaggerated. We estimate that favorable impact in Q1 was approximately $19 million to U.S. AVONEX revenue. We provided the monthly breakdown of AVONEX U.S. units in our earnings slides. As shown, the channel affects for isolated primarily to January and our shipments have normalized over the following months. 
Internationally, Q1 AVONEX revenue was $261 million, an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2011. The impact of foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $8 million, which was offset by a $4 million hedge gain in the quarter. 
Additionally, AVONEX worldwide revenues were impacted by a voluntary product recalls of material whose expiration date were shorter than stated on the label. This unfavorably impacted AVONEX revenue by approximately $7 million. In certain geographies, we either withdraw product or accounted for the withdrawal without a corresponding resupply, as the execution was in the last week of the quarter. 
As a result, the temporary impact to worldwide AVONEX revenue in Q1 from the channel dynamics in product withdrawal was approximately $26 million. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide end-market sales were $399 million and Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI product revenues of $286 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 19% to $87 million. 
Q1 international TYSABRI revenue was $198 million. The first quarter revenues were impacted by $17 million of deferred revenue in Italy, which is the same as we highlighted in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the accounting and national medicines agency claim. We hope to have a commission meeting in the coming months with the Italian authorities, and we're working to have resolution in 2012. 
The impact of foreign exchange for the first quarter softened revenue by $5 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $2 million gain from hedging. 
U.S. Rituxan sales were $792 million, up 10%, driven by a number of factors, including an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL, continued uptake in CLL and longer treatment duration. 
Our U.S. profit share was $258 million. Royalties and profit sharing sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $27 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q1, up double-digit. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $15 million. Royalties were $29 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year, but a decreased of 45% versus the prior quarter. As mentioned, END UMAX royalties reset to a lower royalty rate in Q1, as seen in previous years. 
As we move to the second half of 2012, we expect to benefit from increased GMX royalties. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 constant goods sold were $133 million, or 10% of revenues. This includes approximately $9 million of write-offs and $6 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. 
Q1 R&D expense was $354 million, or 27% of revenues, which was driven by the $29 million payment to Isis and the maturing late-stage pipeline. 
Additionally, in Q1, we expensed approximately $26 million for product development and manufacturing campaigns for the Factor VIII index.textile programs. These expenses were incurred earlier in the year due to the manufacturing lead times associated with each products. 
Q1 SG&A expense was $300 million, or 23% of revenues, an increase of 23% over last year and 6% sequential quarterly increase. This was driven by an increased investment medical affairs and medical education to support the marketed therapies and the potential product launches in 2013. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $86 million. Other income and expense was a gain of $15 million in Q1. Included in this amount were $11 million of net gains related to various strategic investments, including a one-time $9 million gain for our prior equity investment in Stromedix. 
Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. From the year-over-year basis, we benefited from higher orphan drug tax credits and determination of certain intercompany royalties. Also in Q1, we benefited from a one-time determination from the IRS, allowing us to deduct the pharmacy expense for our Rituxan business. 
In the first quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $242 million. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4 million shares or total cost of $463 million, completing our share stabilization program for 2012. 
We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S.. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.40 in the first quarter. 
Now turning to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single-digits at the higher end of our previously communicated range. Our expense targets, as a percentage of sales, are unchanged from previous guidance, with cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenues, R&D between 24% and 25% of total revenue and SG&A between 22% and 23% of total revenue. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income. We also plan to execute an additional $500 million share repurchase under our existing share authorization with the objective of returning capital to shareholders. We plan to execute this with open market purchases over the balance of 2012. 
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.15 and GAAP earnings per share above $5.54. This modest improvement in EPS guidance reflects continued execution of our business plan and delivering the benefits of the new share repurchase program. 
Now I'll hand over the call to George for his closing comments."

Because of the successes we had in 2011, we entered 2012 with a lot to do, and we're focus on execution. Our goals for this year, to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market share, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue. And we're on our way to accomplish those goals. We're also propylene investing to ensure that we are well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 NMS and factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include a ramp-up of medical and commercial capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches. 
We'll continue to advance our Phase III programs for dexpramipexole and PEGylated Interferon, which will read out later this year and early next year, respectively, as well as the trials for Daclizumab and for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which will read out in 2014 and '15, respectively. 
And of course, we continue to ADVANCE and grow our early-stage pipeline to ensure that we're poised for future growth. As we sit here, we're eagerly the Phase III data readouts isolated this year for the blood factors for Hemophilia for dexpramipexole, which is a therapy that has the potential to be the first treatment for ALS patients in more than 15 years. 
We expect to accomplish all of that while, at the same time, delivering revenue and EPS growth. So we are updating our guidance to reflect our confidence in the business and our plan for the future. But lastly, we look forward to presenting highlights of both our early and late stage R&D programs, as well as our commercial strategy at our upcoming Analyst Day on June 12. We'll provide additional details about this event later this month. 
And so with that, I will close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

And while we're just a little bit ready to give exact targets for next year. I mean, there's certainly the upward pressure on spending this year is the result of a very fortunate late stage program that set of programs that we have. Our company supports 6 or 7, depending on how you count it, late-stage program that the bulk of our spending, as I've characterized it in the past, if you look at this on a project basis, the late-stage programs consume over half of the R&D expenses. When we spin a post pivotal trial to certainly, the spinning doesn't go away. We're seeing that this year, we BG-12 where patients have moved out of the trial, we continue to have spending on BG-12 for the expansions study. We continue to have spending for product, as you move into safety. But it does decline on a project-by-project basis. So I think that we don't have the upward pressure on R&D spending as we go into 2013 that we're seeing now. As I also noted, for Q1, we had some spending for DAC on manufacturing campaigns, as well as the blood factors. Those are at-risk. Those are things that we, nevertheless, feel important to do. So if these product do get to the marketplace that we're getting to the marketplace with the most, the adequate product supply, obviously, in good kind of product presentations, which are complex kind of for both of those programs. And then, obviously, in the first quarter, we had the $29 million payment to Isis. So I think that's kind of directionally where we see it going as we move into 2013. And then, I think the other key factor, obviously, is the range of business development activity, which to date, has really been focused on building the early-stage pipeline, which by a large consumers are far more manageable amount to spending."

Just always to caution it on a short term basis. The exact idea Max in the patient can go up and down a little bit. But we see, as you see on the unit growth numbers and the overall patient numbers, we feel very good on that front. In terms of testing dynamics, no, all positives have not, by any means, come off. I think we're very early days in that cycle. We've actually seen the majority of positives continue to stay on the product. The long-term discontinuation for that group, I think, as an open question.

By now I'm sure that most of you had a chance to review our press release for the first quarter of 2012. We reported revenue growth of 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. 
While most of our performance measures met or exceeded expectations, the EPS number, of course, is below the external estimates, although it is in line with our internal estimates. While every quarter includes a lot of gives and takes, this quarter was a bit more complicated than usual. The bottom line though is that AVONEX orders were below expectations in January and without this factor, we would have met the external estimates, even with a significant investment for the future that we made during the quarter. 
So the question is whether or not there's an underlying issue with the AVONEX business or whether there were isolated factors that contributed to the January results, and the answer is basically good news. We believe that the fundamental [indiscernible] for AVONEX remains solid and that they January revenues were the result of isolated events, which we'll go into a little later in the call. 
While we're not satisfied with this events, we're heartened by the fact that AVONEX sales rebounded quickly with both revenues and units on track in February and March. 
So let me now turn to the many positive aspects of the quarter. Both TYSABRI and RITUXAN delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q1, and TYSABRI was particularly strong with 14% year-over-year growth. 
TYSABRI net patient adds continue to show strength, as we begin to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status to the neurology community. RITUXAN also had a strong quarter and sales of FAMPYRA in EU were encouraging. All of these aspects, of course, are positive and with AVONEX back on track, we're quite optimistic about the full year. Paul will go into the details, but I just want say here that we believe we're now on track to achieve an EPS this year of greater than $6.15. 
During the first quarter, we achieved a number of very important product and pipeline milestones. The AVONEX PEN was approved in the U.S. and launched last week, improving AVONEX administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest. 
We simultaneously received approval for the titration kit, known as AVOSTARTGRIP, which will help reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms for new AVONEX patients. We gained FDA approval to include the JC virus antibody status, as part of risk stratification for PML in the U.S. TYSABRI label. This change allows the sales force to talk to physicians and health care professionals about all 3 factors of risk stratification, which is a very important step towards realizing the full potential of this therapy. 
At the American Academy of Neurology meeting lastly, our pipeline was the subject of 49 platform presentations and posters, including new data for TYSABRI, BG-12, FAMPYRA, daclizumab, dexpramipexole and Anti-Lingo. 
We were able to present the full data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, and highlight the efficacy and safety data for the program. The AAN also provided a platform for us to showcase the AVONEX PEN and titration kit for the U.S. market. We made further progress this quarter ongoing our early-stage pipeline with our acquisition of Stromedix, thereby adding to our pipeline a noble full humanized monoclonal antibody for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF.
IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to scarring of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe have IPF, and there is a high-end met need for better therapies for these patients. 
Adding to our early-stage pipeline, we entered a collaboration with ISIS earlier this quarter under which our companies will develop and commercialize ISIS anti-sense investigational drug for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy or SMA. 
SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness and it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. And of course, most notably, we submitted applications for marketing approval of BG-12 in the U.S. and the EU this quarter, ahead of our internal target. 
And I'd like to thank the BG-12 team and the many people of Biogen Idec who worked many hours to make this happen. Our EU application has been validated by the EMA and is formally under review. As most of you know, a couple of months have passed since we filed the BG-12 NDA with the FDA. All of our interactions with the agency, to date, including recent conversations, have led us to believe that our application is on track and will be accepted with standard review. 
We anticipate a confirmatory letter of acceptance within a couple of weeks. We continue to make progress in our clinical programs as well. Factor VIII, Factor IX and dexpramipexole is on track for data readouts later this year, and PEGylated Interferon for a readout, first part of next year. 
So all in all, a very productive quarter for product and pipeline accomplishments. So let me now turn the call over to Doug Williams, Head of R&D, and I'll come back at the end for the concluding comments."

During Q1, we continue to make progress on several aspects of our R&D programs, starting with important advances on the regulatory front. 
This quarter, the FDA approved the AVONEX PEN, the first intramuscular auto injector, and simultaneously approved AVOSTARTGRIP, a new dose titration regimen. As you know, we submitted BG-12 for marketing approval with the FDA and EMA earlier this year. As George indicated, we believe we are on track with the U.S. review process and expect a confirmatory letter in the coming weeks stating that our NDA has been accepted. 
In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has validated Biogen Idec's marketing authorization application for a review of BG-12 in the European Union, and we recently filed for marketing approval of BG-12 in Canada and Switzerland. 
The NDA filing for BG-12 was the largest Biogen Idec has done to date, and it was the commitment of many dedicated people that made this happen. We continue to move closer to making this potential new oral treatment for MS available for patients. 
Last week, important data on our neurology franchise were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline was demonstrated with 49 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. 
We shared comprehensive data for the CONFIRM, the second registrational study of BG-12, at 3 platform presentations. Results from CONFIRM showed that BG-12 demonstrated strong efficacy across a variety of measures, including annualized relapse rate, and also met MRI endpoints in a cohort of patients, demonstrating a significant effect on these measures of disease activity. 
In a platform presentation focused on the safety profile of BG-12 and CONFIRM, both dose regimens of BG-12 showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles, which were consistent with those seen in DEFINE. The incidence of serious infection was slow and balanced across the study groups and there were no opportunistic infections. There were no malignancy seen in the BG-12 arms at CONFIRM. While there was one malignancy seen in the placebo and 4 malignancy seen in the Glaterimer Acetate arms of the trial. The most common side effects for BG-12 were flushing and GI events, which decreased substantially after the first month and resulted in a low incidence of discontinuations. 
Lastly, the poster presentation of a Phase I study of BG-12 in combination with aspirin in healthy volunteers demonstrated that the PK profile of BG-12 was not affected by aspirin and that pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of BG-12-related flushing without any adverse impact on GI symptoms. 
Turning to TYSABRI. 14 posters and presentations were presented at this year's AAN meeting, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. The initial data from the TYSABRI observational program, or TOP, indicated that patients experienced significantly reduced annualized relapse rates after 4 years of treatment with TYSABRI and the level of disability progression, as measured by EDSS, remains stable over time. 
Additionally, interim results from the ongoing STRATIFY 2 trial supported what has been seen in other clinical research, where the overall anti-JCV antibody prevalence among MS patients was approximately 50% to 60%. Recall that the primary objective of STRATIFY 2 is to demonstrate, prospectively, that the PML risk in TYSABRI-treated patients who are anti-JCV antibody negative is lower than the PML risk in patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive. 
An interim analysis, conducted with data collected as of February 2012, showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of PML in anti-JCV antibody negative versus positive patients. 
STRATIFY 2 also showed that anti-JCV antibody prevalence was lower in females than males and increased with age. Treatment with TYSABRI did not appear to affect patients' anti-JCV antibody status. 
Initial findings from the TYNERGY study, a 12-month trial looking at MS-related fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, showed that TYSABRI treatment was associated with improved MS-related fatigue. This result was very important as 50% to 60% of MS patients report fatigue is one of their most disabling symptoms, which can contribute to both cognitive and physical difficulties. 
We also presented further details of daclizumab SELECT trial in the scientific program highlights plenary session, as well as the baseline features of the EMPOWER study, our first Phase III clinical trial of dexpramipexole for patients with ALS. 
Since the design of EMPOWER and the entry criteria are the same as the Phase II trial, we're hopeful that we can replicate the results we saw in that study. 
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline. We presented data from 2 Phase I studies of Anti-Lingo monoclonal antibody or BIIB33 that has been shown an animal models to promote remyelination and axon survival. The first Phase I study was a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, while the second study was a multiple ascending dose study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS. Primary endpoints for both studies were the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as other safety evaluations. 
Secondary end points for both studies included several measures of serum and CSF  levels of BIIB33. Data presented indicated that single and multiple doses of BIIB33 appear to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and subjects with MS, and that CSF levels achieved were in the predicted range needed for efficacy, based on animal models of demyelination. 
Importantly, the result supported advancing the development of the agent into Phase II proof of concept studies, which we expect to initiate in the second half of 2012. 
Moving on to other early-stage compounds in our portfolio. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made expanding our early-stage pipeline this quarter. Through the recent acquisition of Stromedix, we added STX-100, a noble humanized monoclonal antibody that disrupts the TGF-beta signaling pathway, specifically in tissues where fibrotic changes are occurring. 
We're excited about STX-100 because it exhibited significant activity in preclinical animal models of fibrotic disease and demonstrated an attractive safety and tolerability profile in the Phase I program. 
Stromedix has also identified a series of pathways specific biomarkers in the lung to inform dose selection of STX-100 for proof of concept studies. Molecule has potential in several additional fibrotic indications, given the selective mechanism of action and the central role of TGF-beta in fibrosis. We expect to initiate the Phase II study in IPF by midyear. 
This quarter, we also began dosing patients in the Phase I program for ISIS-SMN for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and expect to see results late in 2013. 
As we move forward into 2012, I look forward to providing you key top line data readouts from 3 pivotal trials in the second half of this year, namely the A-Long study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII in Hemophilia A patients, the B-LONG study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor IX in Hemophelia B patients in the second half of 2012. And finally, the data readout from EMPOWER, the first study of dexpramipexole and ALS is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our EVP of Global Commercial Operations."

AVONEX continues to show resilience, and we believe our strategy of focusing on frontline execution to drive share gains within the ABC or E class is succeeding, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., unfavorable channel dyn",595,"Thank you, Doug. AVONEX continues to show resilience, and we believe our strategy of focusing on frontline execution to drive share gains within the ABC or E class is succeeding, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
In the U.S., unfavorable channel dynamics drove lower-than-anticipated unit shipments. We'll walk you through the channel dynamics in greater detail shortly. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, as the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany, Canada and The Netherlands. 
Last week, we introduced the AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP in the U.S. market. We believe these new innovations will help drive additional interest and allow for greater share of voice within the ABC or E market segments. The benefits of once weekly treatment and the importance of staying on therapy make AVONEX PEN an attractive option for patients. This message is driving share growth in countries where we've launched the PEN, and we believe we are poised to experience similar success in the U.S. market. 
Moving on to TYSABRI. First quarter global TYSABRI units increased 18%, while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 14% versus prior year. In the U.S., first quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. 
Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 24% in the first quarter versus prior year. We saw positive patient trends during the first quarter, as we added over 1,900 net new patients. Commercially, we continue to drive TYSABRI strong efficacy message used  the assay to build physician confidence with TYSABRI's benefit risk profile and move the product earlier in the treatment paradigm. 
Based on the U.S. data, discontinuation rates remain stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms increased at their highest level since 2008. TOUCH forms for the newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients have historically been a low single-digit percentage, but were in the high single-digits this quarter. This provides us confidence our commercial strategy is succeeding. 
We continue to believe TYSABRI's growth may see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, but we remain confident in an overall solid growth trajectory. 
The FAMPYRA launch continues to progress as planned, as the product became commercially available in Canada last month. This innovative therapy is also available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. 
We are actively working with government agencies across Europe to achieve favorable reimbursement. We expect feedback publish from IQWIG tomorrow, which is the next step in the German process. 
At the same time, our team continues to drive awareness in the patient physician communities, which is leading to healthy patient demand. In addition to showcasing our world-class scientific research during AAN last week, the significant foot traffic at our booths during the conference was an indicator of physician interest in our recently introduced innovation, such as AVONEX PEN and titration kit and other commercial products. 
We are also making significant progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple potential product launches in the coming years. We expect an early 2013 launch for BG-12 and 2 launches in Hemophilia in 2013. 
As mentioned last quarter, we continue to make investments in product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supplier chain. These developments, in addition to the strong patient demand in TYSABRI seen during the quarter, demonstrate our commitment and ability to drive longer-term commercial results, and we look forward to building upon this encouraging progress. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,183978045,293728,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles.",1175,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.40. We had expected the first quarter to be impacted by the ANGIOMAX royalty stepping down and the $29 million payment to ISIS. So while we need to overcome the shortfall in AVONEX from Q1, we are on track for a full year financial plan. 
Let me now walk down the P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 7% to $1.3 billion. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 3% to $401 million. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.2 weeks of slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. U.S. unit volume was down 8% versus both prior year and last quarter. 
As George noted, our AVONEX U.S. business was unfavorably impacted by what we believe were temporary channel-related headwinds as ongoing patient metrics remain solid. We believe that a few pharmacy wholesalers, which are downstream from our customers, had very soft purchases in January, presumably the result of advanced purchases in the fourth quarter. There was also a transition from Accredo to CVS Caremark to serve as the federal employee program prescription benefit. With this transition, Caremark built up inventory last quarter while Accredo wound down inventory in Q1. 
While January often experiences the modest channel swings, this year the impact was exaggerated. We estimate that the unfavorable impact in Q1 was approximately $19 million to U.S. AVONEX revenue. We provided the monthly breakdown of AVONEX U.S. units in our earnings slides. As shown, the channel affects were isolated primarily to January and our shipments have normalized over the following months. 
Internationally, Q1 AVONEX revenue was $261 million, an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2011. The impact of foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $8 million, which was offset by a $4 million hedge gain in the quarter. 
Additionally, AVONEX worldwide revenues were impacted by a voluntary product recall of some material whose expiration date were shorter than stated on the label. This unfavorably impacted AVONEX revenue by approximately $7 million. In certain geographies, we either withdrew product or accounted for the withdrawal without a corresponding resupply, as the execution was in the last week of the quarter. 
As a result, the temporary impact to worldwide AVONEX revenue in Q1 from the channel dynamics in product withdrawal was approximately $26 million. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide end-market sales were $399 million and Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI product revenues of $286 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 19% to $87 million. 
Q1 international TYSABRI revenue was $198 million. The first quarter revenues were impacted by $17 million of deferred revenue in Italy, which is the same as we highlighted in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the Italian National Medicines agency claim. We hope to have a commission meeting in the coming months with the Italian authorities, and we're working to have resolution in 2012. 
The impact of foreign exchange for the first quarter softened revenue by $5 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $2 million gain from hedging. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $792 million, up 10%, driven by a number of factors, including an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL, continued uptake in CLL in longer treatment duration. 
Our U.S. profit share was $258 million. Royalties and profit sharing sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $27 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q1, up double-digit. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $15 million. Royalties were $29 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year, but a decrease of 45% versus the prior quarter. As mentioned, ANGIOMAX royalties reset to a lower royalty rate in Q1, as seen in previous years. 
As we move to the second half of 2012, we expect to benefit from increased ANGIOMAX royalties. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $133 million or 10% of revenues. This includes approximately $9 million of write-offs and $6 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. 
Q1 R&D expense was $354 million or 27% of revenues, which was driven by the $29 million payment to ISIS and the maturing late-stage pipeline. 
Additionally in Q1, we expensed approximately $26 million for product development and manufacturing campaigns for the Factor VIII in dexpramipexole programs. These expenses were incurred early in the year due to the manufacturing lead times associated with each products. 
Q1 SG&A expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues, an increase of 23% over last year and 6% sequential quarterly increase. This was driven by increased investment medical affairs and medical education to support the marketed therapies and the potential product launches in 2013. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $86 million. Other income and expense was a gain of $15 million in Q1. Included in this amount were $11 million of net gains related to various strategic investments, including a onetime $9 million gain for our prior equity investment in Stromedix. 
Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. From the year-over-year basis, we benefited from higher orphan drug tax credits and determination of certain intercompany royalties. Also in Q1, we benefited from a onetime determination from the IRS, allowing us to deduct the pharma [ph] fee expense for our RITUXAN business. 
In the first quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $242 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total cost of $463 million, completing our share stabilization program for 2012. 
We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S.. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.40 in the first quarter. 
Now turning to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single-digits at the higher end of our previously communicated range. Our expense targets, as a percentage of sales, are unchanged from previous guidance, with cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue, R&D between 24% and 25% of total revenue and SG&A between 22% and 23% of total revenue. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income. We also plan to execute an additional $500 million share repurchase under our existing share authorization with the objective of returning capital to shareholders. We plan to execute this with open market purchases over the balance of 2012. 
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.15 and GAAP earnings per share above $5.54. This modest improvement in EPS guidance reflects continued execution of our business plan and delivering the benefits of the new share repurchase program. 
Now I'll hand over the call to George for his closing comments."

Our goals for this year: to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market share; stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share; and growing FAMPYRA revenue. And we're on our way to accomplish those goals. 
We're also appropriately investing to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include a ramp-up of medical and commercial capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches. 
We'll continue to advance our Phase III programs for dexpramipexole and PEGylated Interferon, which will read out later this year and early next year, respectively, as well as the trials for Daclizumab and for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which will read out in 2014 and '15, respectively. 
And of course, we continue to advance and grow our early-stage pipeline to ensure that we're poised for future growth. As we sit here, we're eagerly anticipating the Phase III data readouts later this year for the long-lasting blood factors for Hemophilia and for dexpramipexole, which is a therapy that has the potential to be the first treatment for ALS patients in more than 15 years. 
We expect to accomplish all of that while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth. So we are updating our guidance to reflect our confidence in the business and our plan for the future. Lastly, we look forward to presenting highlights of both our early and late stage R&D programs, as well as our commercial strategy at our upcoming Analyst Day on June 12.

And while we're just a little bit reticent to give exact targets for next year, I mean, there's certainly the upward pressure on spending this year is the result of a very fortunate late stage program, set of programs that we have. Our company supports 6 or 7, depending on how you count it, late-stage programs that the bulk of our spending, as I've characterized it in the past, if you look at this on a project basis, the late-stage programs consume over half of the R&D expenses. When we spin a post pivotal trial and certainly the spinning doesn't go away, we're seeing that this year with BG-12 while patients have moved out of the trial, we continue to have spending on BG-12 for the extension study. We continue to have spending for a product as you move into safety. But it does decline on a project-by-project basis. So I think that we don't have the upward pressure on R&D spending as we go into 2013 that we're seeing now. As I also noted, for Q1, we had some spending for DAC on manufacturing campaigns, as well as the blood factors. Those are at risk. Those are things that we, nevertheless, feel important to do. So if this product do get to the marketplace that we're getting to the marketplace with the most, the adequate product supply, obviously, in good kind of product presentations, which are complex kind of for both of those programs. And then obviously, in the first quarter, we had the $29 million payment to. ISIS. So I think that's kind of directionally where we see it going as we move into 2013. And then I think the other key factor, obviously, is the range of business development activity, which to date, has really been focused on building the early-stage pipeline, which, by and large consumes a far more manageable amount of spending."

But that's a very -- I mean, if you think about that, that's a very sizable number on what is currently in the magnitude of 640,000 to 650,000 treated patients on disease modifying therapies. Certainly, all of those won't come back to therapy simply for a safer oral, but there's certainly a big number of those. And the second part was with respect to the DAC. And to give you a little bit more flavor on both of those, and I'm probably getting out of my league here a little bit. But Factor VIII, it just takes a number of a long lead time to really, to get to manufacturing campaigns done. And we're doing some product development work, important product development work, such that the product presentations that we bring to the market and that it gets right down to kind of vials and all that type of stuff in kind of devices is highly competitive, vis-à-vis, the incumbents in the marketplace. And DAC is simply a matter of a little bit of a complicated API that we wanted to make sure that we're kind of well ahead of that. Obviously, DAC is the kind of meaningfully at risk spending that we're doing. But given this patient population, the high-end met need, we felt that it was important to put that average month spending to work."

By now, I'm sure that most of you had a chance to review our press release for the first quarter of 2012. We reported revenue growth of 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. 
While most of our performance measures met or exceeded expectations, the EPS number, of course, is below the external estimates, although it is in line with our internal estimates. While every quarter includes a lot of gives and takes, this quarter was a bit more complicated than usual. The bottom line, though, is that AVONEX orders were below expectations in January and without this factor we would have met the external estimates, even with a significant investment for the future that we made during the quarter. 
So the question is whether or not there's an underlying issue with the AVONEX business or whether there were isolated factors that contributed to the January results, and the answer is basically good news. We believe that the fundamental demand for AVONEX remains solid and that the January revenues were the result of isolated events, which we'll go into a little later in the call. 
While we're not satisfied with these events, we're heartened by the fact that AVONEX sales rebounded quickly with both revenues and units on track in February and March. 
So let me now turn to the many positive aspects of the quarter. Both TYSABRI and RITUXAN delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q1, and TYSABRI was particularly strong with 14% year-over-year growth. 
TYSABRI net patient adds continued to show strength, as we began to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status to the neurology community. RITUXAN also had a strong quarter and sales of FAMPYRA in EU were encouraging. All of these aspects, of course, are positive and with AVONEX back on track, we're quite optimistic about the full year. Paul will go into the details, but I just want say here that we believe we're now on track to achieve an EPS this year of greater than $6.15. 
During the first quarter, we achieved a number of very important product and pipeline milestones. The AVONEX PEN was approved in the U.S. and launched last week, improving AVONEX administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest. 
We simultaneously received approval for the titration kit, known as AVOSTARTGRIP, which will help reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms for new AVONEX patients. We gained FDA approval to include the JC virus antibody status as part of risk stratification for PML in the U.S. TYSABRI label. This change allows the sales force to talk to physicians and health care professionals about all 3 factors of risk stratification, which is a very important step towards realizing the full potential of this therapy. 
At the American Academy of Neurology meeting last week, our pipeline was the subject of 49 platform presentations and posters, including new data for TYSABRI, BG-12, FAMPYRA, daclizumab, dexpramipexole and Anti-Lingo. 
We were able to present the full data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, and highlight the efficacy and safety data for the program. The AAN also provided a platform for us to showcase the AVONEX PEN and titration kit for the U.S. market. We made further progress this quarter ongoing our early-stage pipeline with our acquisition of Stromedix, thereby adding to our pipeline a novel humanized monoclonal antibody for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF.
IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to scarring of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe have IPF, and there is a high unmet need for better therapies for these patients. 
Adding to our early-stage pipeline, we entered a collaboration with ISIS earlier this quarter under which our companies will develop and commercialize ISIS anti-sense investigational drug for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy or SMA. 
SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness and it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. And of course most notably, we submitted applications for marketing approval of BG-12 in the U.S. and the EU this quarter, ahead of our internal target. And I'd like to thank the BG-12 team and the many people of Biogen Idec who worked many hours to make this happen. Our EU application has been validated by the EMA and is formally under review. As most of you know, a couple of months have passed since we filed the BG-12 NDA with the FDA. All of our interactions with the agency to date, including recent conversations, have led us to believe that our application is on track and will be accepted with standard review. 
We anticipate a confirmatory letter of acceptance within a couple of weeks. We continue to make progress in our clinical programs as well. Factor VIII, Factor IX and dexpramipexole remain on track for data readouts later this year, and PEGylated Interferon for a readout in the first part of next year. So all in all, a very productive quarter for product and pipeline accomplishments. 
So let me now turn the call over to Doug Williams, Head of R&D, and I'll come back at the end for a few concluding comments."

During Q1, we continued to make progress on several aspects of our R&D programs, starting with important advances on the regulatory front. 
This quarter, the FDA approved the AVONEX PEN, the first intramuscular auto injector, and simultaneously approved AVOSTARTGRIP, a new dose titration regimen. As you know, we submitted BG-12 for marketing approval with the FDA and EMA earlier this year. As George indicated, we believe we are on track for the U.S. review process and expect a confirmatory letter in the coming weeks stating that our NDA has been accepted. 
In addition the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has validated Biogen Idec's marketing authorization application for a review of BG-12 in the European Union, and we recently filed for marketing approval of BG-12 in Canada and Switzerland. 
The NDA filing for BG-12 was the largest Biogen Idec has done to date, and it was the commitment of many dedicated people that made this happen. We continue to move closer to making this potential new oral treatment for MS available for patients. 
Last week, important data on our neurology franchise were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline was demonstrated with 49 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. 
We shared comprehensive data for CONFIRM, the second registrational study of BG-12, at 3 platform presentations. Results from CONFIRM showed that BG-12 demonstrated strong efficacy across a variety of measures, including annualized relapse rate, and also met MRI endpoints in a cohort of patients, demonstrating a significant effect on these measures of disease activity. 
In a platform presentation focused on the safety profile of BG-12 and CONFIRM, both dose regimens of BG-12 showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles, which were consistent with those seen in DEFINE. The incidence of serious infection was slow and balanced across the study groups and there were no opportunistic infections. There were no malignancies seen in the BG-12 arms at CONFIRM, while there was one malignancy seen in the placebo and 4 malignancies seen in the Glaterimer Acetate arms of the trial. The most common side effects for BG-12 were flushing and GI events, which decreased substantially after the first month and resulted in a low incidence of discontinuations. 
Lastly, the poster presentation of a Phase I study of BG-12 in combination with aspirin in healthy volunteers demonstrated that the PK profile of BG-12 was not affected by aspirin and that pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of BG-12-related flushing without any adverse impact on GI symptoms. 
Turning to TYSABRI. 14 posters and presentations were presented at this year's AAN meeting, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. The initial data from the TYSABRI observational program, or TOP, indicated that patients experienced significantly reduced annualized relapse rates after 4 years of treatment with TYSABRI and the level of disability progression, as measured by EDSS, remains stable over time. 
Additionally, interim results from the ongoing STRATIFY 2 trial supported what has been seen in other clinical research, where the overall anti-JCV antibody prevalence among MS patients was approximately 50% to 60%. Recall that the primary objective of STRATIFY 2 is to demonstrate, prospectively, that the PML risk in TYSABRI-treated patients who are anti-JCV antibody negative is lower than the PML risk in patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive. 
An interim analysis conducted with data collected as of February 2012 showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of PML in anti-JCV antibody negative versus positive patients. 
STRATIFY 2 also showed that anti-JCV antibody prevalence was lower in females than males and increased with age. Treatment with TYSABRI did not appear to affect patients' anti-JCV antibody status. 
Initial findings from the TYNERGY study, a 12-month trial looking at MS-related fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, showed that TYSABRI treatment was associated with improved MS-related fatigue. This result was very important, as 50% to 60% of MS patients report fatigue as one of their most disabling symptoms, which can contribute to both cognitive and physical difficulties. 
We also presented further details of the daclizumab SELECT trial in the scientific program highlights plenary session, as well as the baseline features of the EMPOWER study, our first Phase III clinical trial of dexpramipexole for patients with ALS. 
Since the design of EMPOWER and the entry criteria are the same as the Phase II trial, we're hopeful that we can replicate the results we saw in that study. 
Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline. We presented data from 2 Phase I studies of Anti-Lingo monoclonal antibody or BIIB33 that has been shown an animal models to promote remyelination and axon survival. The first Phase I study was a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, while the second study was a multiple ascending dose study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS. Primary endpoints for both studies were the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as other safety evaluations. 
Secondary end points for both studies included several measures of serum and CSF levels of BIIB33. Data presented indicated that single and multiple doses of BIIB33 appear to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and subjects with MS, and that CSF levels achieved were in the predicted range needed for efficacy, based on animal models of demyelination. 
Importantly, the result supported advancing the development of the agent into Phase II proof of concept studies, which we expect to initiate in the second half of 2012. 
Moving on to other early-stage compounds in our portfolio, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made expanding our early-stage pipeline this quarter. Through the recent acquisition of Stromedix, we added STX-100, a noble humanized monoclonal antibody that disrupts the TGF-beta signaling pathway, specifically in tissues where fibrotic changes are occurring. 
We're excited about STX-100 because it exhibited significant activity in preclinical animal models of fibrotic disease and demonstrated an attractive safety and tolerability profile in the Phase I program. 
Stromedix has also identified a series of pathway-specific biomarkers in the lung to inform dose selection of STX-100 for proof of concept studies. Molecule has potential in several additional fibrotic indications, given the selective mechanism of action and the central role of TGF-beta in fibrosis. We expect to initiate the Phase II study in IPF by midyear. 
This quarter, we also began dosing patients in the Phase I program for ISIS-SMN for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and expect to see results late in 2013. 
As we move forward into 2012, I look forward to providing you key top line data readouts from 3 pivotal trials in the second half of this year, namely the A-Long study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII in Hemophilia A patients, the B-LONG study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor IX in Hemophelia B patients in the second half of 2012. And finally, the data readout from EMPOWER, the first study of dexpramipexole and ALS is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our EVP of Global Commercial Operations."

AVONEX continues to show resilience, and we believe our strategy of focusing on frontline execution to drive share gains within the ABC or E class is succeeding, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
In the U.S., unfavorable channel dynamics drove lower-than-anticipated unit shipments. We'll walk you through the channel dynamics in greater detail shortly. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, as the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany, Canada and The Netherlands. 
Last week, we introduced the AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP in the U.S. market. We believe these new innovations will help drive additional interest and allow for greater share of voice within the ABC or E market segments. The benefits of once weekly treatment and the importance of staying on therapy make AVONEX PEN an attractive option for patients. This message is driving share growth in countries where we've launched the PEN, and we believe we are poised to experience similar success in the U.S. market. 
Moving on to TYSABRI. First quarter global TYSABRI units increased 18%, while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 14% versus prior year. In the U.S., first quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. 
Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 24% in the first quarter versus prior year. We saw positive patient trends during the first quarter, as we added over 1,900 net new patients. Commercially, we continue to drive TYSABRI's strong efficacy message, use the assay to build physician confidence with TYSABRI's benefit risk profile and move the product earlier in the treatment paradigm. 
Based on the U.S. data, discontinuation rates remain stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms increased at their highest level since 2008. TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients have historically been a low single-digit percentage, but were in the high single-digits this quarter. This provides us confidence our commercial strategy is succeeding. 
We continue to believe TYSABRI's growth may see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, but we remain confident in an overall solid growth trajectory. 
The FAMPYRA launch continues to progress as planned, as the product became commercially available in Canada last month. This innovative therapy is also available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. 
We are actively working with government agencies across Europe to achieve favorable reimbursement. We expect feedback published from IQWIG tomorrow, which is the next step in the German process. 
At the same time, our team continues to drive awareness in the patient physician communities, which is leading to healthy patient demand. In addition to showcasing our world-class scientific research during AAN last week, the significant foot traffic at our booths during the conference was an indicator of physician interest in our recently introduced innovation, such as AVONEX PEN and titration kit and other commercial products. 
We are also making significant progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple potential product launches in the coming years. We expect an early 2013 launch for BG-12 and 2 launches in Hemophilia in 2013. 
As mentioned last quarter, we continue to make investments in product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supplier chain. These developments, in addition to the strong patient demand in TYSABRI seen during the quarter, demonstrate our commitment and ability to drive longer-term commercial results, and we look forward to building upon this encouraging progress. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles.",1179,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.40. We had expected the first quarter to be impacted by the ANGIOMAX royalty stepping down and the $29 million payment to ISIS. So while we need to overcome the shortfall in AVONEX from Q1, we are on track for a full year financial plan. 
Let me now walk down the P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 7% to $1.3 billion. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 3% to $401 million. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.2 weeks of slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. U.S. unit volume was down 8% versus both prior year and last quarter. 
As George noted, our AVONEX U.S. business was unfavorably impacted by what we believe were temporary channel-related headwinds as ongoing patient metrics remain solid. We believe that a few pharmacy wholesalers, which are downstream from our customers, had very soft purchases in January, presumably the result of advanced purchases in the fourth quarter. There was also a transition from Accredo to CVS Caremark to serve as the federal employee program prescription benefit. With this transition, Caremark built up inventory last quarter for these patients, while Accredo wound down inventory in Q1. 
While January often experiences some modest channel swings, this year the impact was exaggerated. We estimate that the unfavorable impact in Q1 was approximately $19 million to U.S. AVONEX revenue. We provided the monthly breakdown of AVONEX U.S. units in our earnings slides. As shown, the channel affects were isolated primarily to January and our shipments have normalized over the following months. 
Internationally, Q1 AVONEX revenue was $261 million, an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2011. The impact of foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $8 million, which was offset by a $4 million hedge gain in the quarter. 
Additionally, AVONEX worldwide revenues were impacted by a voluntary product recall of some material whose expiration date were shorter than stated on the label. This unfavorably impacted AVONEX revenue by approximately $7 million. In certain geographies, we either withdrew product or accounted for the withdrawal without a corresponding resupply, as the execution was in the last week of the quarter. 
As a result, the temporary impact to worldwide AVONEX revenue in Q1 from the channel dynamics in product referral was approximately $26 million. 
Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide end-market sales were $399 million and Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI product revenues of $286 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 19% to $87 million. 
Q1 international TYSABRI revenue was $198 million. The first quarter revenues were impacted by $17 million of deferred revenue in Italy, which is the same issues we highlighted in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the Italian National Medicines agency claim. We hope to have a commission meeting in the coming months with the Italian authorities, and we're working to have resolution in 2012. 
The impact of foreign exchange for the first quarter softened revenue by $5 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $2 million gain from hedging. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $792 million, up 10%, driven by a number of factors, including an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL, continued uptake in CLL in longer treatment duration. 
Our U.S. profit share was $258 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $27 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q1, up double-digit. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $15 million. Royalties were $29 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year, but a decrease of 45% versus the prior quarter. As mentioned, ANGIOMAX royalties reset to a lower royalty rate in Q1, as seen in previous years. 
As we move to the second half of 2012, we expect to benefit from increased ANGIOMAX royalties. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $133 million or 10% of revenues. This includes approximately $9 million of write-offs and $6 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. 
Q1 R&D expense was $354 million or 27% of revenues, which was driven by the $29 million payment to ISIS and the maturing late-stage pipeline. 
Additionally in Q1, we expensed approximately $26 million for product development and manufacturing campaigns for the Factor VIII in dexpramipexole programs. These expenses were incurred early in the year due to the manufacturing lead times associated with each product. 
Q1 SG&A expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues, an increase of 23% over last year and 6% sequential quarterly increase. This was driven by increased investment medical affairs and medical education to support the marketed therapies and the potential product launches in 2013. 
Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $86 million. Other income and expense was a gain of $15 million in Q1. Included in this amount were $11 million of net gains related to various strategic investments, including a onetime $9 million gain for our prior equity investment in Stromedix. 
Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. From a year-over-year basis, we benefited from higher orphan drug tax credits and determination of certain intercompany royalties. Also in Q1, we benefited from a onetime determination from the IRS, allowing us to deduct the pharma [ph] fee expense for our RITUXAN business. 
In the first quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $242 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total cost of $463 million, completing our share stabilization program for 2012. 
We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.40 in the first quarter. 
Now turning to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single-digits at the higher end of our previously communicated range. Our expense targets as a percentage of sales are unchanged from previous guidance, with cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue, R&D between 24% and 25% of total revenue and SG&A between 22% and 23% of total revenue. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income. We also plan to execute an additional $500 million share repurchase under our existing share authorization with the objective of returning capital to shareholders. We'll plan to execute this with open market purchases over the balance of 2012. 
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.15 and GAAP earnings per share above $5.54. This modest improvement in EPS guidance reflects continued execution of our business plan and delivering the benefits of the new share repurchase program. 
Now I'll hand over the call to George for his closing comments."

Because of the successes we had in 2011, we entered 2012 with a lot to do, and we're focused on execution. Our goals for this year: to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market share; stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share; and growing FAMPYRA revenue. And we're on our way to accomplish those goals. 
We're also appropriately investing to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include a ramp-up of medical and commercial capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches. 
We'll continue to advance our Phase III programs for dexpramipexole and PEGylated Interferon, which will read out later this year and early next year, respectively, as well as the trials for Daclizumab and for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which will read out in 2014 and '15, respectively. 
And of course, we continue to advance and grow our early-stage pipeline to ensure that we're poised for future growth. As we sit here, we're eagerly anticipating the Phase III data readouts later this year for the long-lasting blood factors for Hemophilia and for dexpramipexole, which is a therapy that has the potential to be the first treatment for ALS patients in more than 15 years. 
We expect to accomplish all of that while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth. So we're updating our guidance to reflect our confidence in the business and our plan for the future. Lastly, we look forward to presenting highlights of both our early and late stage R&D programs, as well as our commercial strategy at our upcoming Analyst Day on June 12. We'll provide additional details about this event later this month. 
And so with that, I will close our remarks and open up the call for questions."

And while we're just a little bit reticent to give exact targets for next year, I mean certainly, the upward pressure on spending this year is the result of a very fortunate late stage program, set of programs that we have. Our company supports 6 or 7, depending on how you count it, late-stage programs that the bulk of our spending, as I've characterized it in the past, if you look at this on a project basis, the late-stage programs consume over half of the R&D expenses. When we spin a post pivotal trial and certainly the spinning doesn't go away, we're seeing that this year with BG-12 while patients have moved out of the trial, we continue to have spending on BG-12 for the extension study. We continue to have spending for a product as you move into safety. But it does decline on a project-by-project basis. So I think that we don't have the upward pressure on R&D spending as we go into 2013 that we're seeing now. As I also noted, for Q1, we had some spending for DAC on manufacturing campaigns, as well as the blood factors. Those are at risk. Those are things that we, nevertheless, feel important to do. So if these products do get to the marketplace that we're getting to the marketplace with the most, the adequate product supply, obviously, in good kind of product presentations, which are complex kind of for both of those programs. And then obviously in the first quarter, we had the $29 million payment to ISIS. So I think that's kind of directionally where we see it going as we move into 2013. And then I think the other key factor, obviously, is the range of business development activity, which to date has really been focused on building the early-stage pipeline which, by and large, consumes a far more manageable amount of spending."

We've just seen that over the time frame. But we feel collectively, when you add those all together, the pattern looks good, and we feel like we're on the right trajectory. So no particular headwinds, just always to caution it on a short-term basis. The exact dynamics in the patients can go up and down a little bit. But we see, as you saw in the unit growth numbers and in the overall patient growth numbers, we feel very good on that front. In terms of testing dynamics no, all positives have not, by any means, come off. I think we're very early days in that cycle. We've actually seen the majority of positives continue to stay on the product. The long-term discontinuation for that group, I think, is an open question. We think we will lose more positives over time. But today, it's been actually quite sticky with the majority of positives staying on."

We have a very good pulse on the inventory levels with our customers in the United States. In fact, we have contractual relationships where they exchange, electronically exchange data with us in order for us to supply and in order for us to know those inventory levels.

We had an excellent second quarter, and we're on track to achieve our financial business and R&D goals for the year. Revenues and earnings for the quarter were solid. Costs were in line with expectations. We continue to make headway preparing for the approval and launch of the BG-12. We completed enrollment in the trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX and expect to have top line data within the next several months. We continue to expect data for dexpramipexole and ALS later this year, and we made real progress advancing the rest of our pipeline as well. 
So some highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 34% to $1.82. These numbers are a bit inflated since a year ago, we took a charge related to Genentech's arbitration with sanofi. However, even with that charge backed out, we posted solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
AVONEX had a particularly strong quarter with revenues of $762 million, up 16% year-over-year. The introduction of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector and AVOSTARTGRIP titration dosing regimen in the U.S., as well as our continued rollout in the EU and Canada is not only improving the AVONEX experience for patients but also driving renewed physician interest in one of the world's most trusted MS therapies. 
Global in-market sales of TYSABRI grew 2% to $395 million while revenues to Biogen Idec were $280 million, which is flat compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to the deferral of revenue in our Italian affiliate. While revenue growth slowed, TYSABRI unit sales were up 10% as we continue to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status. 
Patient demand for FAMPYRA in the EU continues to be encouraging, and RITUXAN revenues from our partnership with Roche and Genentech generated $285 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our pipeline. We achieved a number of important milestones in the second quarter. While Doug Williams will provide more details, I wanted to highlight a few of those achievements. 
U.S. and EU regulatory authorities accepted our marketing applications for the review of our oral MS drug candidate, BG-12, and we submitted additional filings in Australia, Canada and Switzerland. In addition to completing the enrollment in our Phase III trials for Long-Lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX, we initiated 2 global pediatric clinical studies for the programs to support our global regulatory strategy and ultimately, we hope to address the significant need for longer-acting therapies for children with Hemophilia. 
Through our second collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, we added an interesting preclinical program intended to develop and commercialize a treatment for myotonic dystrophy. This program fits squarely within our strategy to focus on highly differentiated therapies for serious unmet needs in neurology. So it was a productive quarter in which we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while continuing to invest in the company's future success. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug Williams. Doug?"

But for those of you weren't able to attend, let me briefly recap some of the important takeaways from that meeting. 
We've executed very well on our Phase III pipeline either meeting or beating our internal timelines. At the same time, we strengthened the early stage pipeline by advancing internal Phase I and Phase II candidates and bringing in 4 high-quality innovative candidates that fit squarely within our areas of strategic focus. 
More recently, we've stepped up the pace of revitalizing our discovery efforts. I believe that an increased focus on target identification and validation, both internally and through growing collaborations with academia, is a key to that effort. Research into the underlying biology and genetic causes of disease points to pathways that other companies aren't already chasing and paves the way for us to discover first-in-class, truly novel approaches to address the difficult and devastating diseases in our sites. 
In short, our goal is to build a world-class R&D organization that promises to deliver significant innovation over the long term. We continue to make progress on those fronts during Q2, positioning the company to launch a series of highly differentiated new drugs that address significant unmet needs for patients and that poised the company for future growth.
Starting with the late-stage pipeline. We began 2 global pediatric clinical studies, Kids A-LONG and Kids B-LONG, for our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX FC fusion proteins. In Hemophelia A and B, for children with Hemophilia and their parents, long-lasting factor products would offer less frequent injections, which will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes. The initiation of these studies represents an important clinical development milestone as they're required for regulatory approval in the EU and support our broader global regulatory strategy. We expect to enroll approximately 50 patients in the Kids A-LONG trial and approximately 26 patients in the Kids B-LONG trial in sites around the world. 
Moving on to daclizumab. We completed enrollment in this side, the second registrational trial for daclizumab and relapsing-remitting MS with more than 1,800 patients. The trial will determine whether these significant reduction in annualized relapses and disability progression seen after 1 year of treatment in the SELECT trial can be sustained or enhanced over a period of 2 years. Top line data from the side is expected in 2014. 
I'm also pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this month in the Phase IIa study for STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to fibrosis of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe have IPF, and there's no FDA-approved treatment for the disease at this time. We expect to enroll about 30 patients at 15 U.S. sites in this study.
Turning now to the early stage pipeline and research. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in building out the early stage pipeline over the past year. As George mentioned, we recently added a promising preclinical program targeting myotonic dystrophy or DM1 through a second collaboration with Isis. DM1 is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects about 150,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Japan. It's caused by a genetic defect in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase or DMPK gene, and there are currently no disease modifying therapies to treat DM1. 
As discussed during our Analyst Day, one of our focus areas within neurology is genetically well-defined diseases. DM1 fits squarely within that particular approach. The disease is caused by the accumulation of toxic RNAs in the nucleus of affected individuals because of CTG repeats, and the Isis molecule is designed to specifically correct this accumulation. Isis is working to discover lead drug candidate for the program, which we hope to take into Phase I next year.
Consistent with my earlier comments about revitalizing discovery, last week, we announced that we entered into a consortium that brings together world-class ALS researchers from 6 institutions to obtain the complete sequence of the genomes of up to 1,000 ALS patients over 5 years. The effort should give us a deeper understanding of the fundamental genetic causes of ALS, potentially yielding new targets for therapeutic intervention or patient stratification. Biogen Idec is leading the project, which will be led from Duke University and Hudson Alfa Institute for Biotechnology and include top researchers from Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the University of Montréal. We plan to supplement these activities with additional collaborations and internal efforts to better understand the cell biology of ALS. 
Looking ahead, we have a steady drumbeat of data readouts over the next few years, starting with long-lasting Factors VIII and IX, the first potential innovations in Hemophilia treatment in more than 2 decades. Then dexpramipexole, a therapy that has the potential to be the first ADVANCE for ALS patients in more than 15 years. Those will be followed early next year with PEGylated interferon and then by a series of molecules expected to provide data for proof-of-concept studies thereafter. 
I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters, and with that, I'll now pass the call off to Tony Kingsley."

In the second quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong execution of our product strategies. Second quarter global AVONEX units increased 11% while revenues increased 16% versus prior year. We continue to experience share gains within the ABCRE class in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
Our strategy of focusing on first-line use and bringing convenience to the marketplace has allowed us to further differentiate AVONEX in the injectable segment, making the once-weekly treatment a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. 
The AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP were recently introduced to the U.S. market. The AVONEX PEN has been shown to help reduce the anxiety patients may experience while self injecting. And for patients initiating treatment, titration could reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that they may have when beginning AVONEX therapy. We're pleased by the early indications and believe that the strong demand in the U.S. AVONEX business was a combination of both patient demand for the PEN and PEN inventory stocking related to the recent launch. 
Market data also suggest there's been a strong conversion to the AVONEX PEN from existing patients, and that the majority of patients new to AVONEX therapy have chosen the PEN. The AVOSTARTGRIP performance has also shown very positive preliminary signs in U.S. During the quarter, approximately 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX were with the AVOSTARTGRIP. Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, and the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands.
Now turning to TYSABRI. Second quarter global TYSABRI units increased 10% versus prior year. In the U.S., second quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 11% in the second quarter versus prior year. 
We believe risk stratification is working. There is high awareness of the essay among neurologist, testing volumes are growing nicely. Our most recent estimates are over 100,000 tests completed globally, and an increasing portion of patients tested are new TYSABRI candidates. While we continue to see some fluctuations in discontinuation rates among JCV antibody positive patients, overall, discontinuations are modest. We're seeing solid growth in new patients with 2,400 added during the second quarter. 
We continue to see success with FAMPYRA as revenues approach $20 million in the second quarter, largely driven by Germany. FAMPYRA is now approved across the entire EU, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We expect regulatory filings in 30 additional countries in 2012 and have planned launches in many EU countries. We are actively working with government agencies with a goal of achieving favorable reimbursement. 
In Germany, our interactions with the GBA this quarter continued as we further demonstrated the benefit that FAMPYRA has for patients with MS. The GBA will issue the final assessments in early August 2012, at which time pricing negotiations will commence. We will continue to focus on strong execution to these projects strategies in the second half. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,213576704,329040,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.61 in the second quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $1.82. The financial results this quarter were obviously very strong. We always have puts and takes across the P&L. This quarter, we're fortunate to have a disproportionate number of favorable items. These included a resupply in certain AVONEX international markets, benefits from hedging on AVONEX, a step up in our ANGIOMAX royalties, a low level of write-offs, and we gained a P&L benefit from collections in Spain. I'll highlight these as I walk through the financial results. Nevertheless, we're quite satisfied with where we are on a year-to-date basis.
Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 16% versus prior year to $762 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 13% year-over-year to $464 million. U.S. unit volume was down 2% versus prior year and up 7% versus last quarter. Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at just under 2 weeks, a decrease compared to prior quarter. We're heartened that the U.S. channel dynamics we experienced in the first quarter appear to have been isolated.
Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $298 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For AVONEX, the combined impact of currency and hedging was not a headwind for us in the year-over-year comparison. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $23 million. It was offset by a $10 million hedge gain in the quarter as compared to a $15 million hedge loss in Q2 2011.
AVONEX second quarter global sales also benefited by approximately $7 million from the resupply arising out of the voluntary product recall, which drew down sales at the very end of Q1. And additionally, we benefited from the timing of tender sales in Brazil.
TYSABRI worldwide in market sales were $395 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $280 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenues to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $93 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $187 million to Biogen Idec. 
There are 3 drivers why units increased double digit year-over-year, and revenue growth did not match. First, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $16 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate related to the Italian National Medicines Agency claim. Second, the impact of foreign exchange for the second quarter softened revenue by $19 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $4 million gain from hedging compared to a $3 million hedge loss in the prior year. The amount of the hedge gain that helped mitigate the effects of currency during the quarter for TYSABRI was more modest than AVONEX as we have a natural hedge in our collaboration profit-sharing line. And third, we experienced a modest price in country mix shift. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $784 million, up 5% versus prior year. Performance is solid in the maintenance setting in NHL, CLL, RA and the new vasculitis indications. Our U.S. profit share was $259 million. Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $25 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q2. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $20 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by sales in Germany. Our 1-year anniversary of the FAMPYRA launch in Germany is in August. At that time, we won't have a fixed price from an accounting perspective as our negotiations with the GBA will be ongoing. As a result, we plan to record revenue at a lower price until the price negotiations are final, and therefore, we expect revenues for the remainder of the year to be approximately half of year-to-date sales.
Royalties were $37 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Second quarter royalties were favorable to our business plan, which was the result of achievement of a higher royalty tier on ANGIOMAX sales during Q2. We had previously anticipated to reach this new tier in the third quarter. 
We recorded $22 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 COGS were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX and FAMPYRA revenue and includes approximately $7 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. We experienced essentially no write-offs this quarter. 
Q2 R&D expense was $329 million or 23% of revenues, which includes the $12 million payment to Isis on the DM1 program. Q2 SG&A expense was $301 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 13% over last year and essentially flat versus first quarter. Our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $79 million. 
Other income and expense was a gain of $3 million in Q2. during the quarter, we had a high level of collections in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain where the Spanish government executed the program across the pharma industry to pay down past due receivables, many of which were greater than 1  year old. We received $120 million of accounts receivable due from various Spanish regions. In addition to improving the balance sheet, this resulted in a positive impact in the P&L statement of approximately $5 million due to accelerating previously imputed interest. This was recorded in the OI&E line. 
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $241 million. During the quarter, we made great progress in the $500 million share repurchase program we announced 90 days ago. We purchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total cost of $447 million, and we completed this program in early July, and all shares have been retired. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.82 in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid single digits, unchanged from previous guidance. I'll provide some detail on our revenue outlook. We're encouraged certainly by the second quarter AVONEX strength yet remain mindful about a couple of dynamics, including that downstream retailers are managing both pen and prefilled syringe inventories. And in the U.S., we anticipate a second competitive oral to be approved later this year. 
While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012 and assumes we continue some TYSABRI product revenue being deferred for the rest of the year. If we resolve this, this obviously will be upside. 
Our current guidance does not include sales from BG-12 as we expect launching in early 2013. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of year assumes that revenue will be approximately half of year-to-date sales owing to the German reimbursement process. 
Our expense targets as a percentage of sales are unchanged from previous guidance. Cost of sale is expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue. R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue. Included is a $23 million milestone payment to Portola, which we expect to occur in the third quarter. 
SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the second half, we expect increased investment in prelaunch activity closer to the BG-12 launch. We expect to put large-scale manufacturing facility into service in the second half of this year, which is a very positive milestone. The P&L impact of this will be a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. The result is that we expect our other income and expense line to go from approximately $18 million of favorability year-to-date to approximately $10 million to $20 million of expense for the second half of the year. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% to pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.20 and GAAP EPS above $5.44. This modest improvement in non-GAAP reflects the continued investments in the late-stage pipeline and preparing for upcoming product launches, which intensify in the second half. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

I'm not sure I can break down very specific metrics on second line, first line, third line, but we are continuing to see evidence in the patient and that we're seeing patients tested and then new patients move on to the product, which is very positive. Not a lot of news from our standpoint on Gilenya. We continue on, why we continue to see them sort of chugging along nicely at the level that they have. We think that TYSABRI has a significant efficacy advantage with risk stratification has significant advantage for patients who need that higher efficacy. So just netted out, we did add 2,400 net patient adds in the quarter, which we feel was a very good performance."

Yes, it's exactly what you said. The GBA prices now is such that the price that you go into the market you keep and you have that ""free price"" through your 1-year anniversary. Subsequent to the 1-year anniversary, we will be in price -- we expect to be in price negotiations. Those price negotiations we expect that they could lead into the first quarter of 2013, and whatever that is decided, it goes retroactively back into the first, to the date of the first year anniversary. As a result, as you know, there's 4 requirements for revenue recognition. One of those requirements is a fixed and determinable price. Given that there'll be ambiguity, it is very much strictly an accounting perspective that we'll take a view of what our fixed and determinable prices will be. We expect to be booking revenue at that lower -- at a lower level. That will be reconciled once we get the final kind of price negotiations. So I think it's probably pretty close to the way you characterized it. But and it really and as you know, what we came out of the process with so far is a pretty wide range in terms of and actually a range that is within what our price today is in Germany. So I think it's an accounting convention that we'll be living with for the second half, and I think as importantly, we underscore that the actual demand for the product is quite strong in Germany. And as we move into the other markets, we expect it to be quite strong. So exactly how you characterized it. Al, BG-12 psoriasis?"

In terms of broader macro, the forward pricing environment is certainly a risk factor for our business. In the big 5, we have experienced, and it's already embedded in the P&L.

So I think we think about not just AVONEX but the interferon franchise over time and what it will take. So my statement's about competing in the injectable segment, competing really referred to the AVONEX PEN and then we would hope PEG. Look, the PEG, the kind of profile that PEG potentially could have makes it the clear winner of the injectable segment in my mind for patients. I mean, the convenience factor of a once every 2 week or once a month if that's the way that plays out is very good. So we would likely see the interferon franchise transition over to PEG over time, and we would -- so you wouldn't have a significant increase in sales force and promotion other than what you normally could have around was essentially a pretty significant line extension."

We had an excellent second quarter, and we're on track to achieve our financial business and R&D goals for the year. Revenues and earnings for the quarter were solid. Costs were in line with expectations. We continue to make headway preparing for the approval and launch of BG-12. We completed enrollment in the trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX and expect to have top line data within the next several months. We continue to expect data for dexpramipexole and ALS later this year, and we made real progress advancing the rest of our pipeline as well. 
So some highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 34% to $1.82. These numbers are a bit inflated. Since a year ago, we took a charge related to Genentech's arbitration with sanofi. However, even with that charge backed out, we posted solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
AVONEX had a particularly strong quarter with revenues of $762 million, up 16% year-over-year. The introduction of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector and AVOSTARTGRIP titration dosing regimen in the U.S., as well as our continued rollout in the EU and Canada, is not only improving the AVONEX experience for patients, but also driving renewed physician interest in one of the world's most trusted MS therapies. 
Global in-market sales of TYSABRI grew 2% to $395 million while revenues to Biogen Idec were $280 million, which is flat compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to the deferral of revenue in our Italian affiliate. While revenue growth slowed, TYSABRI unit sales were up 10%, as we continue to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status. 
Patient demand for FAMPYRA in the EU continues to be encouraging, and RITUXAN revenues from our partnership with Roche and Genentech generated $285 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our pipeline. We achieved a number of important milestones in the second quarter. While Doug Williams will provide more details, I wanted to highlight a few of those achievements: U.S. and EU regulatory authorities accepted our marketing applications for the review of our oral MS drug candidate, BG-12, and we submitted additional filings in Australia, Canada and Switzerland. In addition to completing the enrollment in our Phase III trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX, we initiated 2 global pediatric clinical studies for the programs to support our global regulatory strategy. And ultimately, we hope to address the significant need for longer-acting therapies for children with Hemophilia. 
Through a second collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, we added an interesting preclinical program intended to develop and commercialize a treatment for myotonic dystrophy. This program fits squarely within our strategy to focus on highly differentiated therapies for serious unmet needs in neurology. 
So it was a productive quarter in which we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while continuing to invest in the company's future success. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug Williams. Doug?"

We recently had an Analyst Day that many of you attended where we discussed in detail the progress that we've made as an R&D organization over the past 1.5 years.

We recently had an Analyst Day that many of you attended where we discussed in detail the progress that we've made as an R&D organization over the past 1.5 years. But for those of you who weren't able to attend, let me briefly recap some of the important takeaways from that meeting. 
We've executed very well on our Phase III pipeline either meeting or beating our internal timelines. The same time, we've strengthened the early stage pipeline by advancing internal Phase I and Phase II candidates and bringing in 4 high-quality innovative candidates that fit squarely within our areas of strategic focus. 
More recently, we've stepped up the pace of revitalizing our discovery efforts. I believe that an increased focus on target identification and validation, both internally and through growing collaborations with Academia, is a key to that effort. Research into the underlying biology and genetic causes of disease points to pathways that other companies aren't already chasing and paves the way for us to discover first in class, truly novel approaches to address the difficult and devastating diseases in our sites. 
In short, our goal is to build a world-class R&D organization that promises to deliver significant innovation over the long term. We continue to make progress on those fronts during Q2, positioning the company to launch a series of highly differentiated new drugs that address significant unmet needs for patients and that poised the company for future growth.
Starting with the late-stage pipeline, we began 2 global pediatric clinical studies, Kids A-LONG and Kids B-LONG, for our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX Fc fusion proteins. 
In Hemophelia A and B, for children with Hemophilia and their parents, long-lasting factor products would offer less frequent injections, which will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes. The initiation of these studies represents an important clinical development milestone, as they're required for regulatory approval in the EU and support our broader global regulatory strategy. We expect to enroll approximately 50 patients in the Kids A-LONG trial and approximately 26 patients in the Kids B-LONG trial in sites around the world. 
Moving on to daclizumab. We completed enrollment in this side, the second registrational trial for daclizumab and relapsing-remitting MS with more than 1,800 patients. The trial will determine whether the significant reduction in annualized relapses and disability progression seen after 1 year of treatment in the SELECT trial can be sustained or enhanced over a period of 2 years. Top line data from this side is expected in 2014. 
I'm also pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this month in the Phase IIa study for STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease, in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to fibrosis of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe have IPF, and there's no FDA-approved treatment for the disease at this time. We expect to enroll about 30 patients at 15 U.S. sites in this study.
Turning now to the early stage pipeline and research. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in building out the early stage pipeline over the past year. As George mentioned, we recently added a promising preclinical program targeting myotonic dystrophy or DM1 through a second collaboration with Isis. DM1 is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects about 150,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Japan. It's caused by a genetic defect in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase or DMPK gene, and there are currently no disease-modifying therapies to treat DM1. 
As discussed during our Analyst Day, one of our focus areas within neurology is genetically well-defined diseases. DM1 fits squarely within that particular approach. The disease is caused by the accumulation of toxic RNAs in the nucleus of affected individuals because of CTG repeats. And the Isis molecule is designed to specifically correct this accumulation. Isis is working to discover the lead drug candidate for the program, which we hope to take into Phase I next year.
Consistent with my earlier comments about revitalizing discovery, last week, we announced that we entered into a consortium that brings together world-class ALS researchers from 6 institutions to obtain the complete sequence of the genomes of up to 1,000 ALS patients over 5 years. The effort should give us a deeper understanding of the fundamental genetic causes of ALS, potentially yielding new targets for therapeutic intervention or patient stratification. 
Biogen Idec is funding the project, which will be led from Duke University and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnolog and include top researchers from Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the University of Montréal. We plan to supplement these activities with additional collaborations and internal efforts to better understand the cell biology of ALS. 
Looking ahead, we have a steady drumbeat of data readouts over the next few years, starting with long-lasting Factors VIII and IX, the first potential innovations in Hemophilia treatment in more than 2 decades. Then dexpramipexole, a therapy that has the potential to be the first advance for ALS patients in more than 15 years. Those will be followed early next year with PEGylated interferon and then by a series of molecules expected to provide data and proof-of-concept studies thereafter. 
I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll now pass the call off to Tony Kingsley."

In the second quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong execution of our product strategies. Second quarter global AVONEX units increased 11%, while revenues increased 16% versus prior year. We continue to experience share gains within the ABCRE class in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
Our strategy of focusing on first-line use and bringing convenience to the marketplace has allowed us to further differentiate AVONEX in the injectable segment, making the once weekly treatment a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. 
The AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP were recently introduced to the U.S. market. The AVONEX PEN has been shown to help reduce the anxiety patients may experience while self injecting. And for patients initiating treatment, titration could reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that they may have when beginning AVONEX therapy. We're pleased by the early indications and believe that the strong demand in the U.S. AVONEX business was a combination of both patient demand for the PEN and PEN inventory stocking relating to the recent launch. 
Market data also suggests there's been a strong conversion to the AVONEX PEN from existing patients, and that the majority of patients new to AVONEX therapy have chosen the PEN. The AVOSTARTGRIP performance has also shown very positive preliminary signs in the U.S. During the quarter, approximately 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX were with the AVOSTARTGRIP. Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, and the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands.
Now turning to TYSABRI. Second quarter global TYSABRI units increased 10% versus prior year. In the U.S., second quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 11% in the second quarter versus prior year. 
We believe risk stratification is working. There is high awareness of the assay among neurologists, testing volumes are growing nicely. Our most recent estimates are over 100,000 tests completed globally, and an increasing portion of patients tested are new TYSABRI candidates. While we continue to see some fluctuations in discontinuation rates among JCV antibody positive patients, overall, discontinuations are modest. We're seeing solid growth in new patients with 2,400 added during the second quarter. 
We continue to see success with FAMPYRA as revenues approach $20 million in the second quarter, largely driven by Germany. FAMPYRA is now approved across the entire EU, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We expect regulatory filings in 30 additional countries in 2012 and have planned launches in many EU countries. We are actively working with government agencies with a goal of achieving favorable reimbursement. 
In Germany, our interactions with the GBA this quarter continued as we further demonstrated the benefit that FAMPYRA has for patients with MS. The GBA will issue the final assessment in early August 2012, at which time pricing negotiations will commence. We will continue to focus on strong execution to these product strategies in the second half. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.61 in the second quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.82. The financial results this quarter were obviously very strong. We always have puts and takes across the P&L. This quarter, we're fortunate to have a disproportionate number of favorable items. These included a resupply in certain AVONEX international markets, benefits from hedging on AVONEX, a step-up in our ANGIOMAX royalties, a low level of write-offs, and we gained a P&L benefit from collections in Spain. I'll highlight these as I walk through the financial results. Nevertheless, we're quite satisfied with where we are on a year-to-date basis.
Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 16% versus prior year to $762 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 13% year-over-year to $464 million. U.S. unit volume was down 2% versus prior year and up 7% versus last quarter. Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at just under 2 weeks, a decrease compared to prior quarter. We're heartened that the U.S. channel dynamics we experienced in the first quarter appear to have been isolated.
Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $298 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For AVONEX, the combined impact of currency and hedging was not a headwind for us in the year-over-year comparison. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $23 million. It was offset by a $10 million hedge gain in the quarter as compared to a $15 million hedge loss in Q2 2011.
AVONEX second quarter global sales also benefited by approximately $7 million from the resupply arising out of the voluntary product recall, which drew down sales at the very end of Q1. And additionally, we benefited from the timing of tender sales in Brazil.
TYSABRI worldwide in market sales were $395 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $280 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $93 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $187 million to Biogen Idec. 
There are 3 drivers why units increased double digit year-over-year and revenue growth did not match. First, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $16 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate related to the Italian National Medicines Agency claim. Second, the impact of foreign exchange for the second quarter softened the revenue by $19 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $4 million gain from hedging compared to a $3 million hedge loss in the prior year. The amount of the hedge gain that helped mitigate the effect of currency during the quarter for TYSABRI was more modest than AVONEX as we have a natural hedge in our collaboration profit-sharing line. And third, we experienced a modest price in country mix shifts. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $784 million, up 5% versus prior year. Performance is solid in the maintenance setting in NHL, CLL, RA and the new vasculitis indications. Our U.S. profit share was $259 million. Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $25 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q2. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $20 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by sales in Germany. Our 1-year anniversary of the FAMPYRA launch in Germany is in August. At that time, we won't have a fixed price from an accounting perspective as our negotiations with the GBA will be ongoing. As a result, we plan to record revenue at a lower price until the price negotiations are final. And therefore, we expect revenues for the remainder of the year to be approximately half of year-to-date sales.
Royalties were $37 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Second quarter royalties were favorable to our business plan, which was the result of achievement of a higher royalty tier on ANGIOMAX sales during Q2. We had previously anticipated to reach this new tier in the third quarter. We recorded $22 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 COGS were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX and FAMPYRA revenue and includes approximately $7 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. We experienced essentially no write-offs this quarter. 
Q2 R&D expense was $329 million or 23% of revenues, which includes the $12 million payment to Isis on the DM1 program. Q2 SG&A expense was $301 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 13% over last year and essentially flat versus first quarter. Our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $79 million. 
Other income and expense was a gain of $3 million in Q2. During the quarter, we had a high level of collections in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain where the Spanish government executed a program across the pharma industry to pay down past due receivables, many of which were greater than 1  year old. We received $120 million of accounts receivable due from various Spanish regions. In addition to improving the balance sheet, this resulted in a positive impact in the P&L statement of approximately $5 million due to accelerating previously imputed interest. This was recorded in the OI&E line. 
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $241 million. During the quarter, we made great progress in the $500 million share repurchase program we announced 90 days ago. We purchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total cost of $447 million, and we completed this program in early July, and all shares have been retired. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.82 in the second quarter. 
Now, I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single digits unchanged from previous guidance. I'll provide some detail on our revenue outlook. We're encouraged certainly by the second quarter AVONEX strength, yet remain mindful about a couple of dynamics, including that downstream retailers are managing both PEN and prefilled syringe inventories. And in the U.S., we anticipate a second competitive oral to be approved later this year. 
While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012 and assumes we continue some TYSABRI product revenue being deferred for the rest of the year. If we resolve this, this obviously would be upside. 
Our current guidance does not include sales from BG-12 as we expect launching in early 2013. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of year assumes that revenue will be approximately half of year-to-date sales owing to the German reimbursement process. 
Our expense targets, as a percentage of sales, are unchanged from previous guidance. Cost of sale is expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue. R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue. Included is a $23 million milestone payment to Portola, which we expect to occur in the third quarter. 
SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the second half, we expect increased investment in prelaunch activity closer to the BG-12 launch. 
We expect to put our Denmark large-scale manufacturing facility into service in the second half of this year, which is a very positive milestone. The P&L impact of this will be a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. The result is that we expect our other income and expense line to go from approximately $18 million of favorability year-to-date to approximately $10 million to $20 million of expense for the second half of the year. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% to pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.20 and GAAP EPS above $5.44. This modest improvement in non-GAAP reflects the continued investments in the late-stage pipeline in preparing for upcoming product launches, which intensify in the second half. 
Now, I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

I'm not sure I can break down very specific metrics on second line, first line, third line, but we are continuing to see evidence in the patient demand that we're seeing patients tested and then -- or new patients moved on to the product, which is very positive. Not a lot of news from our standpoint on Gilenya. We continue on FTY, we continue to see them sort of chugging along nicely at the level that they have.

And then Al's going to try, at least, I don't think we have a lot of perspective on BG-12, but he'll give a little bit on that. Yes, it's exactly what you said. The IQWIG, GBA now is such that the price that you go into the market, you keep and you have that ""free price"" through your 1-year anniversary. Subsequent to the 1-year anniversary, we will be in price -- we expect to be in price negotiations. Those price negotiations, we expect that they could lead into the first quarter of 2013, and whatever that is decided, it goes retroactively back to the first, to the date of the first year anniversary. As a result, as you know, there's 4 requirements for revenue recognition. One of those requirements is a fixed and determinable price. Given that there'll be ambiguity, it is very much strictly an accounting perspective that we'll take a view of what our fixed and determinable prices and be -- we expect to be booking revenue at that lower -- at a lower level. That will be reconciled once we get the final kind of price negotiations. So I think it's probably pretty close to the way you characterized it. But -- and it really -- and as you know, what we came out of the IQWIG process with so far is a pretty wide range in terms of -- and actually, a range that is within what our price today is in Germany. So I think it's an accounting convention that we'll be living with for the second half. And I think as importantly, we've underscored that the actual demand for the product is quite strong in Germany. And as we move into the other markets, we expect it to be quite strong. So exactly how you characterized it. Al, BG-12 psoriasis?"

We're just trying to be mindful that around the world and certainly in the United States, there may be some retailers that are managing kind of both PEN and lyophilized. We may be getting a modest benefit from that. So I think really that's it. Nevertheless, I think we feel is a very, very strong, strong quarter. And then broadly speaking, the guidance is -- we're hoping -- we're going to be pushing hard as much as we can for the balance of the year, but the guidance also certainly is trying to point out that we have intensification of some of the prelaunch expenses for the second half as we get closer to BG-12 launch and even as we start to invest a little bit and prudently in Factor VIII and Factor IX potentially over the next 6 months."

In the other trial, we will be looking -- using state-of-the-art imaging technology to look very closely at MS lesions at the time they form, and then the evolution of those lesions in the month thereafter, where we think that some remyelination occurs naturally, but we hope to enhance that natural process with anti-LINGO.

We had an excellent second quarter, and we're on track to achieve our financial business and R&D goals for the year. Revenues and earnings for the quarter were solid. Costs were in line with expectations",507,"Okay, thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent second quarter, and we're on track to achieve our financial business and R&D goals for the year. Revenues and earnings for the quarter were solid. Costs were in line with expectations. We continue to make headway preparing for the approval and launch of BG-12. We completed enrollment in the trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX and expect to have top line data within the next several months. We continue to expect data for dexpramipexole in ALS later this year, and we made real progress advancing the rest of our pipeline as well. 
So some highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 34% to $1.82. These numbers are a bit inflated since a year ago, we took a charge related to Genentech's arbitration with sanofi. However, even with that charge backed out, we posted solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
AVONEX had a particularly strong quarter with revenues of $762 million, up 16% year-over-year. The introduction of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector and AVOSTARTGRIP titration dosing regimen in the U.S., as well as our continued rollout in the EU and Canada, is not only improving the AVONEX experience for patients, but also driving renewed physician interest in one of the world's most trusted MS therapies. 
Global in-market sales of TYSABRI grew 2% to $395 million while revenues to Biogen Idec were $280 million, which is flat compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to the deferral of revenue in our Italian affiliate. While revenue growth slowed, TYSABRI unit sales were up 10%, as we continued to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status. 
Patient demand for FAMPYRA in the EU continues to be encouraging, and RITUXAN revenues from our partnership with Roche and Genentech generated $285 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our pipeline. We achieved a number of important milestones in the second quarter. While Doug Williams will provide more details, I wanted to highlight a few of those achievements: U.S. and EU regulatory authorities accepted our marketing applications for the review of our oral MS drug candidate, BG-12, and we submitted additional filings in Australia, Canada and Switzerland. In addition to completing the enrollment in our Phase III trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX, we initiated 2 global pediatric clinical studies for the programs to support our global regulatory strategy. And ultimately, we hope to address the significant need for longer-acting therapies for children with hemophilia. 
Through a second collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, we added an interesting preclinical program intended to develop and commercialize a treatment for myotonic dystrophy. This program fits squarely within our strategy to focus on highly differentiated therapies for serious unmet needs in neurology. 
So it was a productive quarter in which we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while continuing to invest in the company's future success. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug Williams. Doug?"

I believe that an increased focus on target identification and validation, both internally and through growing collaborations with Academia, is a key to that effort. Research into the underlying biology and genetic causes of disease points to pathways that other companies aren't already chasing and paves the way for us to discover first in class, truly novel approaches to address the difficult and devastating diseases in our sights. 
In short, our goal is to build a world-class R&D organization that promises to deliver significant innovation over the long term. We continued to make progress on those fronts during Q2, positioning the company to launch a series of highly differentiated new drugs that address significant unmet needs for patients and that poise the company for future growth.
Starting with the late-stage pipeline, we began 2 global pediatric clinical studies, Kids A-LONG and Kids B-LONG, for our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX Fc fusion proteins in hemophilia A and B. For children with hemophilia in their parents, long-lasting factor products would offer less frequent injections, which will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes. The initiation of these studies represents an important clinical development milestone, as they're required for regulatory approval in the EU and support our broader global regulatory strategy. We expect to enroll approximately 50 patients in the Kids A-LONG trial and approximately 26 patients in the Kids B-LONG trial in sites around the world. 
Moving on to daclizumab. We completed enrollment in DECIDE, the second registrational trial for daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS with more than 1,800 patients. The trial will determine whether the significant reduction in annualized relapses and disability progression seen after 1 year of treatment in the SELECT trial can be sustained or enhanced over a period of 2 years. Top line data from DECIDE is expected in 2014. 
I'm also pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this month in the Phase IIa study for STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease, in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to fibrosis of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe have IPF, and there's no FDA-approved treatment for the disease at this time. We expect to enroll about 30 patients at 15 U.S. sites in this study.
Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in building out the early-stage pipeline over the past year. As George mentioned, we recently added a promising preclinical program targeting myotonic dystrophy or DM1 through a second collaboration with Isis. DM1 is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects about 150,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Japan. It's caused by a genetic defect in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase or DMPK gene, and there are currently no disease-modifying therapies to treat DM1. 
As discussed during our Analyst Day, one of our focus areas within neurology is genetically well-defined diseases. DM1 fits squarely within that particular approach. The disease is caused by the accumulation of toxic RNAs in the nucleus of affected individuals because of CTG repeats. And the Isis molecule is designed to specifically correct this accumulation. Isis is working to discover the lead drug candidate for the program, which we hope to take into Phase I next year.
Consistent with my earlier comments about revitalizing discovery, last week, we announced that we entered into a consortium that brings together world-class ALS researchers from 6 institutions to obtain the complete sequence of the genomes of up to 1,000 ALS patients over 5 years. The effort should give us a deeper understanding of the fundamental genetic causes of ALS, potentially yielding new targets for therapeutic intervention or patient stratification. 
Biogen Idec is funding the project, which will be led from Duke University and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and include top researchers from Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the University of Montréal. We plan to supplement these activities with additional collaborations and internal efforts to better understand the cell biology of ALS. 
Looking ahead, we have a steady drumbeat of data readouts over the next few years, starting with long-lasting Factors VIII and IX, the first potential innovations in hemophilia treatment in more than 2 decades. Then dexpramipexole, a therapy that has the potential to be the first advance for ALS patients in more than 15 years. Those will be followed early next year with PEGylated interferon and then by a series of molecules expected to provide data and proof-of-concept studies thereafter. 
I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll now pass the call off to Tony Kingsley."

In the second quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong execution of our product strategies. Second quarter global AVONEX units increased 11%, while revenues increased 16% versus prior year. We continue to experience share gains within the ABCRE class in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
Our strategy of focusing on first-line use and bringing convenience to the marketplace has allowed us to further differentiate AVONEX in the injectable segment, making the once weekly treatment a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. 
The AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP were recently introduced to the U.S. market. The AVONEX PEN has been shown to help reduce the anxiety patients may experience while self injecting. And for patients initiating treatment, titration could reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that they may have when beginning AVONEX therapy. We're pleased by the early indications and believe that the strong demand in the U.S. AVONEX business was a combination of both patient demand for the PEN and PEN inventory stocking relating to the recent launch. 
Market data also suggests there's been a strong conversion to the AVONEX PEN from existing patients, and that the majority of patients new to AVONEX therapy have chosen the PEN. The AVOSTARTGRIP performance has also shown very positive preliminary signs in the U.S. During the quarter, approximately 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX were with the AVOSTARTGRIP. Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, and the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands.
Now turning to TYSABRI. Second quarter global TYSABRI units increased 10% versus prior year. In the U.S., second quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 11% in the second quarter versus prior year. 
We believe risk stratification is working. There is high awareness of the assay among neurologists, testing volumes are growing nicely -- our most recent estimates are over 100,000 tests completed globally -- and an increasing portion of patients tested are new TYSABRI candidates. While we continue to see some fluctuations in discontinuation rates among JCV antibody positive patients, overall, discontinuations are modest. We're seeing solid growth in new patients with 2,400 added during the second quarter. 
We continue to see success with FAMPYRA as revenues approach $20 million in the second quarter, largely driven by Germany. FAMPYRA is now approved across the entire EU, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We expect regulatory filings in 30 additional countries in 2012 and have planned launches in many EU countries. We are actively working with government agencies with a goal of achieving favorable reimbursement. 
In Germany, our interactions with the GBA this quarter continued as we further demonstrated the benefit that FAMPYRA has for patients with MS. The GBA will issue the final assessment in early August 2012, at which time pricing negotiations will commence. We will continue to focus on strong execution of these product strategies in the second half. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer."
29726,213576704,329488,"Biogen Idec Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.61 in the second quarter.

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.61 in the second quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.82. The financial results this quarter were obviously very strong. We always have puts and takes across the P&L. This quarter, we're fortunate to have a disproportionate number of favorable items. These included a resupply in certain AVONEX international markets, benefits from hedging on AVONEX, a step-up in our ANGIOMAX royalties, a low level of write-offs, and we gained a P&L benefit from collections in Spain. I'll highlight these as I walk through the financial results. Nevertheless, we're quite satisfied with where we are on a year-to-date basis.
Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 16% versus prior year to $762 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 13% year-over-year to $464 million. U.S. unit volume was down 2% versus prior year and up 7% versus last quarter. Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at just under 2 weeks, a decrease compared to prior quarter. We're heartened that the U.S. channel dynamics we experienced in the first quarter appear to have been isolated.
Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $298 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For AVONEX, the combined impact of currency and hedging was not a headwind for us in the year-over-year comparison. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $23 million. It was offset by a $10 million hedge gain in the quarter as compared to a $15 million hedge loss in Q2 2011.
AVONEX second quarter global sales also benefited by approximately $7 million from the resupply arising out of the voluntary product recall, which drew down sales at the very end of Q1. And additionally, we benefited from the timing of tender sales in Brazil.
TYSABRI worldwide in market sales were $395 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $280 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $93 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $187 million to Biogen Idec. 
There are 3 drivers why units increased double digit year-over-year and revenue growth did not match. First, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $16 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate related to the Italian National Medicines Agency claim. Second, the impact of foreign exchange for the second quarter softened revenue by $19 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $4 million gain from hedging compared to a $3 million hedge loss in the prior year. The amount of the hedge gain that helped mitigate the effect of currency during the quarter for TYSABRI was more modest than AVONEX as we have a natural hedge in our collaboration profit-sharing line. And third, we experienced a modest price in country mix shifts. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $784 million, up 5% versus prior year. Performance is solid in the maintenance setting in NHL, CLL, RA and the new vasculitis indications. Our U.S. profit share was $259 million. Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $25 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q2. 
FAMPYRA revenue was $20 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by sales in Germany. Our 1-year anniversary of the FAMPYRA launch in Germany is in August. At that time, we won't have a fixed price from an accounting perspective as our negotiations with the GBA will be ongoing. As a result, we plan to record revenue at a lower price until the price negotiations are final. And therefore, we expect revenues for the remainder of the year to be approximately half of year-to-date sales.
Royalties were $37 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Second quarter royalties were favorable to our business plan, which was the result of achievement of a higher royalty tier on ANGIOMAX sales during Q2. We had previously anticipated to reach this new tier in the third quarter. We recorded $22 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by manufacturing contracts with strategic partners. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 COGS were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX and FAMPYRA revenue and includes approximately $7 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. We experienced essentially no write-offs this quarter. 
Q2 R&D expense was $329 million or 23% of revenues, which includes the $12 million payment to Isis on the DM1 program. Q2 SG&A expense was $301 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 13% over last year and essentially flat versus first quarter. Our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $79 million. 
Other income and expense was a gain of $3 million in Q2. During the quarter, we had a high level of collections in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain where the Spanish government executed a program across the pharma industry to pay down past due receivables, many of which were greater than 1 year old. We received $120 million of accounts receivable due from various Spanish regions. In addition to improving the balance sheet, this resulted in a positive impact in the P&L statement of approximately $5 million due to accelerating previously imputed interest. This was recorded in the OI&E line. 
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $241 million. During the quarter, we made great progress in the $500 million share repurchase program we announced 90 days ago. We purchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total cost of $447 million, and we completed this program in early July, and all shares have been retired. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.82 in the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single digits, unchanged from previous guidance. I'll provide some detail on our revenue outlook. We're encouraged certainly by the second quarter AVONEX strength, yet remain mindful about a couple of dynamics, including that downstream retailers are managing both PEN and prefilled syringe inventories. And in the U.S., we anticipate a second competitive oral to be approved later this year. 
While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012 and assumes we continue some TYSABRI product revenue being deferred for the rest of the year. If we resolve this, this obviously would be upside. 
Our current guidance does not include sales from BG-12 as we expect launching in early 2013. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of year assumes that revenue will be approximately half of year-to-date sales owing to the German reimbursement process. 
Our expense targets, as a percentage of sales, are unchanged from previous guidance. Cost of sales, expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue. R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue. Included is a $23 million milestone payment to Portola, which we expect to occur in the third quarter. 
SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the second half, we expect increased investment in prelaunch activity closer to the BG-12 launch. 
We expect to put our Denmark large-scale manufacturing facility into service in the second half of this year, which is a very positive milestone. The P&L impact of this will be a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. The result is that we expect our other income and expense line to go from approximately $18 million of favorability year-to-date to approximately $10 million to $20 million of expense for the second half of the year. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.20 and GAAP EPS above $5.44. This modest improvement in non-GAAP reflects the continued investments in the late-stage pipeline in preparing for upcoming product launches, which intensify in the second half. 
Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

I'm not sure I can break down very specific metrics on second line, first line, third line, but we are continuing to see evidence in the patient demand that we're seeing patients tested and then -- or new patients moved on to the product, which is very positive. Not a lot of news from our standpoint on Gilenya. We continue on FTY, we continue to see them sort of chugging along nicely at the level that they have. Again, we think that TYSABRI has a significant efficacy advantage, and with risk stratification, a significant advantage for patients who really need that higher efficacy. So just, it netted out. We did add 2,400 net patient adds in the quarter, which we feel was a very good performance."

I can't tell you that every existing patient has been tested, but as we tracked it, we believe that most of the existing TYSABRI patients have been tested. And again the testing mix is shifting now. We still have a significant number of existing patients being tested because people will be retested over time, but it's shifting more to new candidates over time. Discontinuation rates, again, we track that through a variety of indirect measures in the EU, including market research and speaking with physicians and other things.

And then Al's going to try, at least, I don't think we have a lot of perspective on BG-12, but he'll give a little bit on that. Yes, it's exactly what you said. The IQWIG, GBA process now is such that the price that you go into the market, you keep and you have that ""free price"" through your 1-year anniversary. Subsequent to the 1-year anniversary, we will be in price -- we expect to be in price negotiations. Those price negotiations, we expect that they could bleed into the first quarter of 2013, and whatever that is decided, it goes retroactively back to the first, to the date of the first year anniversary. As a result, as you know, there's 4 requirements for revenue recognition. One of those requirements is a fixed and determinable price. Given that there'll be ambiguity, it is very much strictly an accounting perspective that we'll take a view of what our fixed and determinable prices and be -- we expect to be booking revenue at that lower -- at a lower level. That will be reconciled once we get the final kind of price negotiations. So I think it's probably pretty close to the way you characterized it. But -- and it really -- and as you know, what we came out of the IQWIG process with so far is a pretty wide range in terms of -- and actually, a range that is within what our price today is in Germany. So I think it's an accounting convention that we'll be living with for the second half. And I think as importantly, we'd underscored that the actual demand for the product is quite strong in Germany. And as we move into the other markets, we expect it to be quite strong. So exactly how you characterized it. Al, BG-12 psoriasis?"

As you alluded to 3 different sales forces depending on what was being sold, if the PEGylated form of AVONEX is successful in the market or for in clinical development, how do you actually fragment that with that first injectable sales force, if I could just call it that, given it's extraordinarily promotionally sensitive?

So my statements about competing in the injectable segment and out-competing really referred to the AVONEX PEN, and then we would hope PEG. Look, PEG, the kind of profile that PEG potentially could have, makes it the clear winner in the injectable segment in my mind for patients. I mean the convenience factor of a once every 2 week or once a month, if that's the way that plays out is very good. So we would likely see the interferon franchise transition over to PEG over time. And we would -- so you wouldn't have a significant increase in sales force and promotion other than what you normally would have around what's essentially a pretty significant line extension."

We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. 
As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a one-time item of $32 million related to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. 
The AVONEX business continues to deliver improved contribution, driven by share performance within the ABCRE E-Class, both inside and outside of the U.S. The AVONEX pen, designed to improve the self-injection experienced, renewed physician interest and health to maintain Share of Voice and awareness of the branded in a competitive market. 
We continue to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units, both in and outside of the U.S, Awareness remains high for our risk ratification tools, and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. 
The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making and the product risk ratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction. We also made progress with our late-stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational with study for Factor IX in Hemophelia B and we're expecting results for Factor VIII in the near future.
Last week, the FDA informed as of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for the review of the New Drug Application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we continue to work with the agency to facilitate their review. And while this 3-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential BG-12 to benefit patients with M&S has not changed. Awareness remains high, aided by the recent publication of BG-12 pivotal data and the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment. 
Earlier this month, we also shared more than 50 company and partner-sponsored presentation at the meeting in Leon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI, AVONEX's 16-year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy, analysis of pool data from the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12, as well as supporting data on the postmodern anti-Lingo as possible treatments for MS.
And the breadth of our presence and the presentation highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bring better medicines to patients in all segments of the market. The well-established injectables, the high efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment. 
So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail."

These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline. 
Last month, we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our competent, long-lasting Factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top line results from the study.
Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting Factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study and a comparison of the annualized lead rates, or ABR, between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study.
The results showed that compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing ARMS of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting Factor IX. Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved the dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm.
No patients developed inhibitors to Factor IX, and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting Factor IX was generally well-tolerated in the study. While there are still ongoing analysis being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our competent long-lasting Factor VIII in the near future.
Moving now to our late-stage neurology franchise. We showcased the interim results from Endorsed as a latebreaking presentation at the ACTRIMS meeting. Endorse is the double blinded Phase 3 extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240 milligrams BID or TID. 
At the time of the analysis, Endorse had enrolled over 1,700 patients with relapsing remaining MS, who had completed the defined or confirmed studies. In Endorse, the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of De fine and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than 2 years. 
The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with Define and CONFIRM, and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment groups were expected in the population under study.
This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016. In a second latebreaking presentation at ACTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from Selection, the one-year extension study of Select, the first registration all study of that was above HYP or DAC. The results of selections supported the positive finding seen in Select and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of selection showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years 1 and 2 of therapy.
Moving onto TYSABRI. We continue to build and improve upon our risk ratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year, and we anticipate launching it in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV's specific antibodies. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of Long-Lasting Factor VIII in the near future and the Phase 3 study of PEGylated Interferon 1 beta, 1 Alpha and relapsing MS in early 2013. 
For EMPOWER, which is the Phase 3 DAC's dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded, and we expect top line data read-out by late this year or early next year. 
In late September, the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in Empower. As a result, all clinical sites are actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for the final study visit. That timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data readout.
I look forward to providing you with updates in our progress for our late-stage programs in the coming quarters. Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of Anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis and the Phase Ib study for BIIB37 for Alzheimer's disease. The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. The TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flairs and lupus nephritis patients, and the absence of the many effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatment, such as CellCept, which are primarily immunosuppressive. 
Our BIIB37 program is a multiple A sending does Phase Ib study of our anti-beta-amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta-amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.
Proof-of-concept studies for anti-Lingo are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS. 
Finally, we've decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA because of the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market. We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional 6 selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key path rate in chronic autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases.
We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through restructuring and reallocation of resources to support of those early-stage activities. The steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&D group, which I laid out in some detail at the Analyst Day in June.
With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony."

Solid execution of our products strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8%, driven by a 5% units increase year-over-year, as we continue to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets. 
We continue to be pleased with the uptake at the AVONEX PEN and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance. Conveniency is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class. And as once weekly treatment, the AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. 
During the third quarter, more than 2/3 of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. had been with the PEN. We have also seen strong conversion from the prefilled syringe to the PEN, which we believe will benefit longer-term retention.
Similarly, we've seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP, as over 2/3 of all-new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP. Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy, and we maintain our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX PEN is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.
Moving onto TYSABRI. Third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8%, respectively, in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients with 2,100 added during the third quarter. 
We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk ratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI, and we see greater confidence in moving the products earlier in the treatment paradigm.
During the quarter, U.S. discontinuations rates remain stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy.
In Europe, the rollout of the second-generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.
While we were obviously, disappointed by the Purdue for extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well-prepared, as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed practical planning. We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise given the recent positive readout in Factor IX and in the anticipation of the upcoming factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place and will continue to build out the team infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch. 
The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec but we understand that requirements for commercial success, as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent. 
We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches. With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair-value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As George noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related with Benlysta. 
In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the SYK inhibitor programming into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment. Let me walk through the financial results now.
Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter. 
Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than 2 weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in PEN. As a result, we're cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple of quarters. 
Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong, as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. 
Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX revenue by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011.
AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mixed shift to lower-priced distributor markets. 
TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million. 
In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between unit and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange. 
FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $3 million gain from hedging, compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year. 
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million. 
Royalties in profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $29 million. The result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.
FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GVA gave FAMPYRA level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately EUR 1,000 to EUR 3,000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013.
As of August 1, we've been recording FAMPYRA revenue at an net price that assumes the lower end of the range and will continue to do so until the final price has established. 
Royalties were $47 million, and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter. 
Now turning to that expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods solds were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN, nurse training fees and an increased funding related to the JCV assay. 
Q3 R&D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the SYK program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring.
Q3 SG&A expense was $298 million, or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $76 million. 
We now have a new line item on the P&L, as you may have noticed, called Gain on Sale of Rights. Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK in each GSI on global sales of Benlysta. We sold our Benlysta royalty and other rights to a DRI Capital Managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011 through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the Gain of Sale of Rights line. 
During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially 3 quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&L to be less than the amount paid this quarter independent on the uptake of Benlysta. 
Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%. In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 1/3 is outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 financial guidance. Overall, we're raising our full year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches. 
We expect full year revenue growth of mid-to high-single digits, modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012. 
Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of your revenues recorded at the lower end of the GVA range. Our full year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter, due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.
Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan. Cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue. R&D expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenue. 
Our R&D forecast includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for discovery collaboration, which we're in the process of negotiating. 
Additionally, we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.
SG&A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposely back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.
We pulled our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone. And we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid-2013. The short-term P&L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter, which will be recorded on the OI&E line. 
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pre-tax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50, and GAAP earnings per share to be $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the Benlysta-related transaction and the strength in the core business.
As you likely noted, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high watermark for the year. In the fourth quarter, conversely to be the low watermark. This is due to the many of the P&L items I've highlighted, included the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step down of the Benlysta-related gain and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.
So this was a solid quarter. And while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year. I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

But let's understand what the term, the major amendment is kind of a term of art. So in the notable review of an FDA, of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor and to reach the sponsor, in this case, us, response in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment. So by doing so, the FDA extends of PDUFA date for 3 months. And as far as we know, there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by 3 months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, to answer to the question and will not be able to meet the regional PDUFA date. And we believe that's the case with our application. And as you know, Eric, the 3-month extension has been applied to a lot of other compounds, including research approvals in MS.

Most of the imposition, if you will, is Rest of World patients, right? We have pretty darn good visibility with we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation. Outside the United States, it really is -- I apologize that we presented as if it's precise data. But outside the United States, it's a combination of registries and certain countries. Literally, unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't -- and we adjust those as we look backwards. I don't think that as we do that and we look back. It has at all changed the fundamental story. The disconnect outside the United States between units patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We've seen that in past years with TYSABRI, with drug suspension. We're not sensing that outside the United States in Europe. And many can be driven by inventory imparallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to  limit those. But there were some dynamics. And what ends up happening is unit show up in one quarter versus -- as opposed to the other quarter from the patient perspective. The second part of your question, Jeff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore it was modest. Price reductions, we had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those, as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter, the most notable one was France. We're just kind of normal kind of price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of a low single-digit decline in AVONEX price there. But I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate."

It's -- and then, as it relates to 2013, I mean, quite frankly, we really need the next few months under our belt, next 3 or 4 months under our belts, which will give us greater clarity on the next set of pivotal trial readouts. I think I've described that 2013 could be a year of launching 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 products. And that -- if it's the right-hand side of that equation, it obviously puts upward pressure on SG&A for all the great -- all great reasons. And if not, it puts a little bit less of upward pressure on SG&A. So I think -- as we spend into 2013, it very much is a function of the pivotal trial readouts that are upon us over the next -- this cohort of pivotal trial readouts.

No, it doesn't really change our thinking about the development of our own antibody.

I think the ability to remove plaque -- beta-amyloid plaque is going to be, perhaps more like the roach antibody that's been reported out, just based on our mechanism versus the mechanism for the other antibodies. So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta-amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy. I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is important and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population. So we're going about the study, and I think in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I'd characterized, sort of proper efficacy studies, where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like ignitions. So I think weren't learned from their previous studies that have been reported trying to apply that learning to our own molecule. But we're still excited about the antibody and the prospects."

So we benefited from that as well. The third quarter, I think, Spain has kind of gone back to what was more traditional over the last year or 2.

Our strong momentum continued into the third quarter. We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a onetime item of $32 million related to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. 
The AVONEX business continued to deliver improved contribution driven by share performance within the ABCRE class both inside and outside of the U.S. The AVONEX PEN, designed to improve the self-injection experience, renewed physician interest and helped to maintain share of voice and awareness of the brand in a competitive market.
We continued to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units both in and outside of the U.S. Awareness remains high for our risk stratification tools and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making in the product risk stratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction.
We also made progress with our late-stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational study for Factor IX in Hemophelia B and we're expecting results for Factor VIII in the near future.
Last week, the FDA informed us of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for the review of the new drug application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we'll continue to work with the agency to facilitate the review. And while this 3-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential of BG-12 to benefit patients with MS has not changed. Awareness remains high, aided by the recent publication of BG-12's pivotal data in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings, support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment.
Earlier this month, we also shared more than 50 company- and partner-sponsored presentations at the ECTRIMS meeting in Lyon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI; AVONEX's 16-year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy; analysis of pool data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12, as well as supporting data on daclizumab and anti-LINGO as possible treatments for MS. And the breadth of our presence and the presentations highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bring better medicines to patients in all segments of the market: the well-established injectables, the high-efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.
So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail."

During Q3, we continued to made progress on several fronts with our R&D programs. These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline.
Last month, we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our recombinant long-lasting Factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top line results from the study.
Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting Factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study and a comparison of the annualized bleed rates or ABR between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study. The results showed that, compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing arms of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting Factor IX. Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved the dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm.
No patients developed inhibitors to Factor IX and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting Factor IX was generally well tolerated in the study. While there are still ongoing analyses being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our recombinant long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future.
Moving now to our late-stage neurology franchise. We showcased the interim results from ENDORSE as a latebreaking presentation at the ECTRIMS meeting. ENDORSE is the double-blinded Phase III extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240 milligrams BID or TID. At the time of the analysis, ENDORSE had enrolled over 1,700 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had completed the DEFINE or CONFIRM studies. In ENDORSE, the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of DEFINE and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than 2 years. The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with DEFINE and CONFIRM, and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment groups were expected in the population under study. This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016.
In a second latebreaking presentation at ECTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from SELECTION, the one-year extension study of SELECT, the first registrational study of daclizumab HYP or DAC. The results of SELECTION supported the positive finding seen in SELECT and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of SELECTION showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years 1 and 2 of therapy.
Moving on to TYSABRI. We continue to build and improve upon our risk stratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year and we anticipate launching it in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV-specific antibodies.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future; and the Phase III study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a in relapsing MS in early 2013. For EMPOWER, which is the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded and we expect top line data readout by late this year or early next year. In late September, the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in EMPOWER. As a result, all clinical sites are now actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for the final study visit. That timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data readout. I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress for our late-stage programs in the coming quarters.
Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis and the Phase Ib study for BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease. The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. A TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flares in lupus nephritis patients and the absence of immune effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatments, such as CellCept, which are profoundly immunosuppressive.
Our BIIB037 program is a multiple ascending dose Phase Ib study of our anti-beta-amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta-amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.
Proof-of-concept studies for anti-LINGO are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS.
Finally, we've decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA because the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market. We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional 6 selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key pathway in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through restructuring and reallocation of resources to support those early-stage activities. These steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&D group which I laid out in some detail at the Analyst Day in June.
With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony."

Solid execution of our product strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8%, driven by a 5% units increase year-over-year, as we continued to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of the AVONEX PEN and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance. Convenience is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class, and as a once-weekly treatment, the AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. During the third quarter, more than 2/3 of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. had been with the PEN. We've also seen strong conversion from the prefilled syringe to the PEN, which we believe will benefit longer-term retention. Similarly, we've seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP as over 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP.
Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy and we maintained our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX PEN is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.
Moving on to TYSABRI. Third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8%, respectively, in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients, with 2,100 added during the third quarter.
We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk stratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI. And we see greater confidence in moving the products earlier in the treatment paradigm.
During the quarter, U.S. discontinuations rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy. In Europe, the rollout of the second-generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.
While we were obviously disappointed by the PDUFA extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well prepared as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed tactical planning. We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise given the recent positive readout in Factor IX and in anticipation of the upcoming Factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place and we'll continue to build out the team, infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch.
The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec, but we understand the requirements for commercial success as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent.
We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As George noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the Syk Inhibitor program into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment.
Let me walk through the financial results now.
Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter.
Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than 2 weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be some AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in PEN. As a result, we're -- cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple of quarters.
Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX revenue by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011. AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mix shift to lower-priced distributor markets.
TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million.
In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between unit and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange.
FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $30 million gain from hedging compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million.
Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $29 million. The result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.
FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GBA gave FAMPYRA a level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately EUR 1,000 to EUR 3,000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013. As of August 1, we've been recording FAMPYRA revenue at a net price that assumes the lower end of the range and we'll continue to do so until the final price has established.
Royalties were $47 million and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter.
Now turning to that expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods solds were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN, nurse training fees and an increased funding related to the JCV assay.
Q3 R&D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the Syk program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring.
Q3 SG&A expense was $298 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit sharing line totaled $76 million.
We now have a new line item on the P&L, as you may have noticed, called ""gain on sale of rights."" Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK in each GSI on global sales of Benlysta. We sold our Benlysta royalty and other rights to DRI Capital-managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011 through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the gain of sale of rights line. During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially 3 quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&L to be less than the amount paid this quarter, independent on the uptake of Benlysta.
Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%.
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million. And we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 1/3 is outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 financial guidance. Overall, we're raising our full year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches.
We expect full year revenue growth of mid-to high single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of the year assumes revenues recorded at the lower end of the GBA range. Our full year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.
Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan: cost of sales, expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue; R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenue. Our R&D forecast includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for a discovery collaboration which we're in the process of negotiating. Additionally, we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.
SG&A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity, building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposely back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.
We put our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone. And we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid 2013. The short-term P&L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter which will be recorded on the OI&E line.
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50 and GAAP earnings per share to be $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the Benlysta-related transaction and the strength in the core business.
As you likely noted, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high watermark for the year, in the fourth quarter, conversely to be the low watermark. This is due to the many of the P&L items I've highlighted, included the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step-down of the Benlysta-related gain and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.
So this was a solid quarter, and while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year.
I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

Okay, look, technically, the answer to your question is, yes, it is a major amendment. But let's understand what the term -- major amendment is kind of a term of art. So in the normal review of an FDA -- of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor and to which the sponsor, in this case, us, response in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine that any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment. And so by doing so, the FDA extends the PDUFA date for 3 months, and as far as we know, there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by 3 months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, to answer a set of questions, and will not be able to meet the original PDUFA date. And we believe that's the case with our application. And as you know, Eric, a 3-month extension has been applied to a lot of other compounds, including recent approvals in MS. So we believe we're on track, and we have a 3-month of delay."

Most of the imprecision, if you will, is rest of world patients, right? We have pretty darn good visibility, we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation. Outside the United States, it really is -- and I apologize that we presented as if it's precise data, but outside the United States, it's a combination of registries in certain countries, literally unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't -- and we adjust those as we look backwards. I don't think that, as we do that and we look back, it has at all changed the fundamental story. The disconnect outside the United States between units, patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We've seen that in past years with TYSABRI, with drug holidays, suspension. We're not sensing that outside the United States and in Europe. And many can be driven by inventory in parallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to limit those, but there were some dynamics. And what ends up happening is unit show up in one quarter versus -- as opposed to the other quarter from a patient perspective. The second part of your question, Geoff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore, it was modest price reductions. We had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those, as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter, the most notable one was France where just kind of normal kind of price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of like a low-single-digit decline in AVONEX price there. But not -- but I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate."

So on the ALSFRS, the community, the ALS physicians have decided that a change of greater than 20%, so a greater-than-20% change in the slope of decline is considered clinically meaningful. And then on the survival, Riluzole is sort of a benchmark for survival. As you know, in the states, Riluzole is not very commonly use, although in Europe and in Japan, it's quite commonly used. And Riluzole had about a 3-month extension of survival on average, and so I think that's certainly a benchmark that people will use."

So we have the ability to kind of -- and we purposely wanted to throttle that a bit more, going into the fourth quarter, closer to launch. So that's a bit purposeful. So I think that's it's just kind of a helpful framing. It's -- and then, as it relates to 2013, I mean, quite frankly, we really need the next few months under our belt, next 3 or 4 months under our belts, which will give us a greater clarity on the next set of pivotal trial readouts. I think I've described that 2013 could be a year of launching 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 products. And that -- if it's the -- if it's a right-hand side of that equation, it obviously puts upward pressure on SG&A for all the great -- all great reasons. And if not, it puts a little bit less of upward pressure on SG&A. So I think it's going to -- as we spin into 2013, it very much is a function of the pivotal trial readouts that are upon us over the next -- this cohort of pivotal trial readouts. And we'll get -- we should get greater visibility, obviously, as we've noted, soon with respect to Factor VIII by the end of the year or early 2013, for dex. And I think -- so then, we'll be able to talk a lot more about SG&A."

No, it hasn't really changed our thinking about the development of our own antibody. I think we're pretty bullish on the fact that the antibody we have is distinctly different in terms of its mechanism. I think the ability to remove plaque -- beta-amyloid plaque is going to be perhaps more like the Roche antibody that's been reported out, just based on our mechanism versus the mechanism for the other antibodies. So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta-amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy. I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is a prudent and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population. So we're going about the study, and, I think, in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I'd characterize as sort of proper efficacy studies where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like cognitions. So I think we're learning from the previous studies that have been reported and trying to apply that learning to our own molecule. But we're still excited about the antibody and the prospects."

Our strong momentum continued into the third quarter. We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a onetime item of $32 million relating to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. 
The AVONEX business continued to deliver improved contribution driven by share performance within the ABCRE class both inside and outside of the U.S. The AVONEX PEN, designed to improve the self-injection experience, renewed physician interest and helped to maintain share of voice and awareness of the brand in a competitive market.
We continued to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units both in and outside of the U.S. Awareness remains high for our risk stratification tools and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making in the product risk stratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction.
We also made progress with our late-stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational study for Factor IX in Hemophelia B and we're expecting results for Factor VIII in the near future.
Last week, the FDA informed us of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for the review of the new drug application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we continue to work with the agency to facilitate the review. And while this 3-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential of BG-12 to benefit patients with MS has not changed. Awareness remains high, aided by the recent publication of BG-12's pivotal data in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings, support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment.
Earlier this month, we also shared more than 50 company- and partner-sponsored presentations at the ECTRIMS meeting in Lyon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI; AVONEX's 16-year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy; analysis of pool data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12, as well as supporting data on daclizumab and anti-LINGO as possible treatments for MS. I think the breadth of our presence and the presentations highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bring better medicines to patients in all segments of the market: the well-established injectables, the high-efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.
So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail."

These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline.
Last month, we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our recombinant long-lasting Factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top line results from the study.
Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting Factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study and a comparison of the annualized bleed rates or ABR between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study. The results showed that, compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing arms of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting Factor IX. Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved a dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm.
No patients developed inhibitors to Factor IX and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting Factor IX was generally well tolerated in the study. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our recombinant long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future.
Moving now to our late-stage neurology franchise. We showcased the interim results from ENDORSE as a late-breaking presentation at the ECTRIMS meeting. ENDORSE is a double-blinded Phase III extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240 milligrams BID or TID. At the time of the analysis, ENDORSE had enrolled over 1,700 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had completed the DEFINE or CONFIRM studies. In ENDORSE, the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of DEFINE and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than 2 years. The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with DEFINE and CONFIRM, and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment groups were expected in the population under study. This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016.
In a second late-breaking presentation at ECTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from SELECTION, the one-year extension study of SELECT, the first registrational study of daclizumab HYP or DAC. The results of SELECTION supported the positive findings seen in SELECT and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of SELECTION showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years 1 and 2 of therapy.
Moving on to TYSABRI. We continue to build and improve upon our risk stratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year and we anticipate launching it in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV-specific antibodies.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future; and the Phase III study of PEGylated interferon beta-1 alpha in relapsing MS in early 2013. For EMPOWER, which is the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded and we expect top line data readout by late this year or early next year. In late September, the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in EMPOWER. As a result, all clinical sites are now actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for the final study visit. That timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data readout. I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress for our late-stage programs in the coming quarters.
Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis and the Phase Ib study for BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease. The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. The TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flares in lupus nephritis patients and the absence of immune effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatments, such as CellCept, which are profoundly immunosuppressive.
Our BIIB037 program is a multiple ascending dose Phase Ib study of our anti-beta-amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta-amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.
Proof-of-concept studies for anti-LINGO are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS.
Finally, we've decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA because the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market. We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional 6 selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key pathway in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through restructuring and reallocation of resources to support those early stage activities. These steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&D group which I laid out in some detail at the Analyst Day in June.
With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony."

Solid execution of our product strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8%, driven by a 5% units increase year-over-year, as we continued to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of the AVONEX PEN and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance. Convenience is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class, and as a once-weekly treatment, AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. During the third quarter, more than 2/3 of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. have been with the PEN. We've also seen strong conversion from the prefilled syringe to the PEN, which we believe will benefit longer-term retention. Similarly, we've seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP as over 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP.
Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy and we maintained our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX PEN is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.
Moving on to TYSABRI. Third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8%, respectively, in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients, with 2,100 added during the third quarter.
We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk stratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit-risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI. And we see greater confidence in moving the product earlier in the treatment paradigm.
During the quarter, U.S. discontinuations rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy. In Europe, the rollout of the second-generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.
While we were obviously disappointed by the PDUFA extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well prepared as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed tactical planning. We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise given the recent positive readout in Factor IX and in anticipation of the upcoming Factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place and we'll continue to build out the team, infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch.
The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec, but we understand the requirements for commercial success as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent.
We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As George noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the Syk Inhibitor program into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment.
Let me walk through the financial results now. Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter.
Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than 2 weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be some AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in PEN. As a result, we cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple quarters.
Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX revenue by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011. AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mix shift to lower-priced distributor markets.
TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million.
In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between unit and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange.
FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $30 million gain from hedging compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $29 million. The result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.
FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GBA gave FAMPYRA a level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately EUR 1,000 to EUR 3,000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013. As of August 1, we've been recording FAMPYRA revenue at a net price that assumes the lower end of the range and we'll continue to do so until the final price is established. Royalties were $47 million and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN, nurse training fees and an increased funding related to the JCV assay.
Q3 R&D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the Syk program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring.
Q3 SG&A expense was $298 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit sharing line totaled $76 million.
We now have a new line item on the P&L, as you may have noticed, called ""gain on sale of rights."" Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK in each GSI on global sales of Benlysta. We sold our Benlysta royalty and other rights to a DRI Capital-managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011 through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the gain of sale of rights line. During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially 3 quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&L to be less than the amount paid this quarter, independent on the uptake of Benlysta. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%.
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million. And we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 1/3 is outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 financial guidance. Overall, we're raising our full year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches.
We expect full year revenue growth of mid-to high single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of the year assumes revenues recorded at the lower end of the GBA range. Our full year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.
Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan: cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue; R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenue. Our R&D forecast includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for a discovery collaboration which we're in the process of negotiating. Additionally, we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.
SG&A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity, building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposely back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.
We put our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone. And we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid-2013. The short-term P&L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter which will be recorded on the OI&E line.
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50 and GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the Benlysta-related transaction and the strength in the core business.
As you likely noted, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high watermark for the year, and the fourth quarter, conversely to be the low watermark. This is due to the many of the P&L items I've highlighted, included the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step-down of the Benlysta-related gain and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.
So this was a solid quarter, and while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year.
I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

As we prepare for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years, we'll continue to be vigilant, keeping a tight lid on costs while investing where necessary to ensure that we have successful launches and a pipeline that delivers sustainable growth for the future.
We believe that we're on track to deliver solid revenue and EPS growth in a year in which we've had a number of pipeline successes and in which we're investing heavily for the future growth that we anticipate from our new products. And that's not an easy thing to do.

Okay, look, technically, the answer to your question is, yes, it is a major amendment. But let's understand what the term -- major amendment is kind of a term of art. So in the normal review of an FDA -- of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor and to which the sponsor, in this case us, response in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine that any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment. And so by doing so, the FDA extends the PDUFA date for 3 months, and as far as we know, there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by 3 months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, the answers to the questions, and will not be able to meet the original PDUFA date. And we believe that's the case with our application. And as you know, Eric, a 3-month extension has been applied to a lot of other compounds, including recent approvals in MS. So we believe we're on track, and we have a 3-month delay."

Most of the imprecision, if you will, is rest of world patients, right? We have pretty darn good visibility, we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation. Outside the United States, it really is -- and I apologize if we presented it as if it's precise data, but outside the United States, it's a combination of registries in certain countries, literally unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't -- and we adjust those as we look backwards. I don't think that, as we do that and we look back, it has at all changed the fundamental story. The disconnect outside the United States between units, patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We've seen that in past years with TYSABRI, with drug holidays, suspension. We're not sensing that outside the United States and in Europe. And then it can be driven by inventory in parallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to limit those, but there were some dynamics. And what ends up happening is units show up in one quarter versus -- as opposed to the other quarter from a patient perspective. The second part of your question, Geoff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore, it was modest price reductions. We had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those, as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter, the most notable one was France where just kind of normal kind of price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of a low-single-digit decline in AVONEX price there. But I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate."

So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta-amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy. I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is a prudent and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population. So we're going about the study, and I think in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I'd characterize as sort of proper efficacy studies where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like cognition.

We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. As you can see from the press",496,"Okay, thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everyone.
Our strong momentum continued into the third quarter. We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a onetime item of $32 million relating to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. 
The AVONEX business continued to deliver improved contribution driven by share performance within the ABCRE class both inside and outside of the U.S. The AVONEX PEN, designed to improve the self-injection experience, renewed physician interest and helped to maintain share of voice and awareness of the brand in a competitive market.
We continued to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units both in and outside of the U.S. Awareness remains high for our risk stratification tools and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making in the product risk stratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction.
We also made progress with our late-stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational study for Factor IX in Hemophelia B and we're expecting results for Factor VIII in the near future.
Last week, the FDA informed us of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for the review of the new drug application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we continue to work with the agency to facilitate the review. And while this 3-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential of BG-12 to benefit patients with MS has not changed. Awareness remains high, aided by the recent publication of BG-12's pivotal data in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings, support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment.
Earlier this month, we also shared more than 50 company- and partner-sponsored presentations at the ECTRIMS meeting in Lyon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI; AVONEX's 16-year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy; analysis of pool data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12, as well as supporting data on daclizumab and anti-LINGO as possible treatments for MS. I think the breadth of our presence and the presentations highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bring better medicines to patients in all segments of the market: the well-established injectables, the high-efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.
So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail."

These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline.
Last month, we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our recombinant long-lasting Factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top line results from the study.
Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting Factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study and a comparison of the annualized bleed rates or ABR between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study. The results showed that, compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing arms of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting Factor IX. Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved a dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm.
No patients developed inhibitors to Factor IX and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting Factor IX was generally well tolerated in the study. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our recombinant long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future.
Moving now to our late-stage neurology franchise. We showcased the interim results from ENDORSE as a late-breaking presentation at the ECTRIMS meeting. ENDORSE is a double-blinded Phase III extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240 milligrams BID or TID. At the time of the analysis, ENDORSE had enrolled over 1,700 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had completed the DEFINE or CONFIRM studies. In ENDORSE, the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of DEFINE and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than 2 years. The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with DEFINE and CONFIRM, and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment groups were expected in the population under study. This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016.
In a second late-breaking presentation at ECTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from SELECTION, the one-year extension study of SELECT, the first registrational study of daclizumab HYP or DAC. The results of SELECTION supported the positive findings seen in SELECT and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of SELECTION showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years 1 and 2 of therapy.
Moving on to TYSABRI. We continue to build and improve upon our risk stratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year and we anticipate launching it in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV-specific antibodies.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future; and the Phase III study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a in relapsing MS in early 2013. For EMPOWER, which is the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded and we expect top line data readout by late this year or early next year. In late September, the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in EMPOWER. As a result, all clinical sites are now actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for the final study visit. That timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data readout. I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress for our late-stage programs in the coming quarters.
Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis and the Phase Ib study for BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease. The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. The TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flares in lupus nephritis patients and the absence of immune effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatments, such as CellCept, which are profoundly immunosuppressive.
Our BIIB037 program is a multiple ascending dose Phase Ib study of our anti-beta-amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta-amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.
Proof-of-concept studies for anti-LINGO are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS.
Finally, we've decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA because the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market. We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional 6 selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key pathway in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through restructuring and reallocation of resources to support those early stage activities. These steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&D group which I laid out in some detail at the Analyst Day in June.
With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony."

Solid execution of our product strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8%, driven by a 5% units increase year-over-year, as we continued to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of the AVONEX PEN and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance. Convenience is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class, and as a once-weekly treatment, AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. During the third quarter, more than 2/3 of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. have been with the PEN. We've also seen strong conversion from the prefilled syringe to the PEN, which we believe will benefit longer-term retention. Similarly, we've seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP as over 2/3 of all new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP.
Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy and we maintained our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX PEN is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.
Moving on to TYSABRI. Third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8%, respectively, in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients, with 2,100 added during the third quarter.
We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk stratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit-risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI. And we see greater confidence in moving the product earlier in the treatment paradigm.
During the quarter, U.S. discontinuations rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy. In Europe, the rollout of the second-generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.
While we were obviously disappointed by the PDUFA extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well prepared as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed tactical planning. We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise given the recent positive readout in Factor IX and in anticipation of the upcoming Factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place and we'll continue to build out the team, infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch.
The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec, but we understand the requirements for commercial success as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent.
We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As George noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the Syk Inhibitor program into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment.
Let me walk through the financial results now. Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter.
Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than 2 weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be some AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in PEN. As a result, we cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple quarters.
Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX revenue by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011. AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mix shift to lower-priced distributor markets.
TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million.
In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between unit and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange.
FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $30 million gain from hedging compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $29 million. The result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.
FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GBA gave FAMPYRA a level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately EUR 1,000 to EUR 3,000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013. As of August 1, we've been recording FAMPYRA revenue at a net price that assumes the lower end of the range and we'll continue to do so until the final price is established. Royalties were $47 million and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN, nurse training fees and an increased funding related to the JCV assay.
Q3 R&D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the Syk program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring.
Q3 SG&A expense was $298 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit sharing line totaled $76 million.
We now have a new line item on the P&L, as you may have noticed, called ""gain on sale of rights."" Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK in each GSI on global sales of Benlysta. We sold our Benlysta royalty and other rights to a DRI Capital-managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011 through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the gain of sale of rights line. During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially 3 quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&L to be less than the amount paid this quarter, independent on the uptake of Benlysta. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%.
In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million. And we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 1/3 is outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 financial guidance. Overall, we're raising our full year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches.
We expect full year revenue growth of mid-to high single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of the year assumes revenues recorded at the lower end of the GBA range. Our full year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.
Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan: cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue; R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenue. Our R&D forecast includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for a discovery collaboration which we're in the process of negotiating. Additionally, we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.
SG&A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity, building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposely back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.
We put our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone. And we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid-2013. The short-term P&L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter which will be recorded on the OI&E line.
We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50 and GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the Benlysta-related transaction and the strength in the core business.
As you likely noted, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high watermark for the year, and the fourth quarter, conversely to be the low watermark. This is due to the many of the P&L items I've highlighted, included the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step-down of the Benlysta-related gain and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.
So this was a solid quarter, and while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year.
I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments."

Okay, look, technically, the answer to your question is, yes, it is a major amendment. But let's understand what the term -- major amendment is kind of a term of art. So in the normal review of an FDA -- of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor and to which the sponsor, in this case us, response in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine that any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment. And so by doing so, the FDA extends the PDUFA date for 3 months, and as far as we know, there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by 3 months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, the answers to the questions, and will not be able to meet the original PDUFA date.

So and I'm glad you asked the question because, certainly, this -- as my guidance implies, there's some lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter trends on SG&A expense, and that's very purposeful on our end. Costs for Q3 were a little bit lower than we expected for both R&D as well as, actually, SG&A. I mean, that's just kind of the way things kind of turned out for Q3 and resulted in some pull-through on the bottom line, but we do intend -- and it's more than just the personnel costs, right? It's more than just the customer-facing resources. We do intend to, over the next 90 days, or now nearing in on the next 60 days, to really prepare for BG-12 across customer facing, medical education, scientific education, preparing the whole organization. So I think that is very consistent with what we've said over the past is this is a rare opportunity that we have. We don't want to be pennywise and pound foolish, so we'll put kind of the investments in as we get ready for kind of what we hope is a BG-12 launch early in the second quarter of 2013. Tony?"

Most of the imprecision, if you will, is rest of world patients, right? We have pretty darn good visibility, we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation. Outside the United States, it really is -- and I apologize if we presented it as if it's precise data, but outside the United States, it's a combination of registries in certain countries, literally unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't -- and we adjust those as we look backwards. I don't think that, as we do that and we look back, it has at all changed the fundamental story. The disconnect outside the United States between units, patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We've seen that in past years with TYSABRI, with drug holidays, suspension. We're not sensing that outside the United States and in Europe. And then it can be driven by inventory in parallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to limit those, but there were some dynamics. And what ends up happening is units show up in one quarter versus -- as opposed to the other quarter from a patient perspective. The second part of your question, Geoff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore, it was modest price reductions. We had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those, as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter, the most notable one was France where just kind of normal kind of price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of a low-single-digit decline in AVONEX price there. But I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate."

And then on the survival, Riluzole is sort of a benchmark for survival. As you know, in the States, Riluzole is not very commonly used, although in Europe and in Japan, it's quite commonly used. And Riluzole had about a 3-month extension of survival on average, and so I think that that's certainly a benchmark that people will use."

We, as our partner, we're frustrated and disappointed that we weren't able to get it done this year. It's still not over, right?

So I think that's -- it's just kind of a helpful framing. It's -- and then, as it relates to 2013, I mean, quite frankly, we really need the next few months under our belt, next 3 or 4 months under our belts, which will give us a greater clarity on the next set of pivotal trial readouts. I think I've described that 2013 could be a year of launching 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 products. And that if it's the right-hand side of that equation, it obviously puts upward pressure on SG&A for all the great -- all great reasons. And if not, it puts a little bit less of upward pressure on SG&A. So I think it's going -- as we spin into 2013, it very much is a function of the pivotal trial readouts that are upon us over the next -- this cohort of pivotal trial readouts. And we'll get -- we should get greater visibility, obviously, as we've noted, soon with respect to Factor VIII by the end of the year or early 2013, for dex.

No, it hasn't really changed our thinking about the development of our own antibody. I think we're pretty bullish on the fact that the antibody we have is distinctly different in terms of its mechanism. I think the ability to remove plaque -- beta-amyloid plaque is going to be perhaps more like the Roche antibody that's been reported out, just based on our mechanism versus the mechanism for the other antibodies. So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta-amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy. I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is a prudent and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population. So we're going about the study, and I think in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I'd characterize as sort of proper efficacy studies where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like cognition. So I think we're learning from the previous studies that have been reported and trying to apply that learning to our own molecule. But we're still excited about the antibody and the prospects."

So specialty products in Brazil are purchased centrally by the government. AVONEX falls under what's effectively an administrative tender, which is essentially kind of a once-a-year price negotiation.

The other part of your question, I believe, was with respect to accounts receivable in Southern Europe. The second quarter was a very strong payment from Spain as many pharmaceutical companies -- so we benefited from that as well. The third quarter, I think, Spain has kind of gone back to what was more traditional over the last year or 2. We remain at those -- the 3 countries in Southern Europe: Italy, Spain and Portugal, as our areas of key focus from an accounts receivable perspective. We have, in aggregate, a little bit over $200 million of accounts receivable in those 3 countries.
