Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin is joining us from Dallas where he is participating in the World Economic Forum. Before we continue I would like to highlight the reporting change that we are preparing to implement. As we discussed early last year, we are aligning our resources with our platforms and software strategy. In 2012 we will conform our financial reporting to these business segments under the new segment structure, we expect certain product families to be reported under new segments. We will provide you 2 years of recast quarterly history, and we'll concede to provide keep other category data. 
Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call today are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis, and for purposes of today's discussion we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin."
30439,145706832,211692,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. Our results for Q4 in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance,",1530,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. Our results for Q4 in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance, the near-term macro environment and industry dynamics as well as our strategic approach, which is centered on innovation and customer value. I'll wrap up by sharing our operating principles for 2012 and update you on our innovation pipeline. 
Juniper's revenue growth was 9% for 2011. Annual revenue for 2011 represented a new record for the company. Profitability was solid, though lower than expected. Our Q4 results felt the effect of increased micro volatility that escalated over the second half of the year due to the sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slowing recoveries in APAC countries as well as the U.S. 
Here on our U.S. business we saw a number of our largest customers reducing the spend within the quarter, including Tier 1 service providers and financial services. Though another site just like Federal, we saw stronger spending than expected. Another factor that played into recent results is the fact that we're entering what is surely the most exciting new product cycle in our history. As we move to the launch phase on these products we've seen some short-term effects, particularly in core routing as customers awaited the T4000. This product is now shipping, and we are seeing very good early response. Our PTX Transport Core product line is also on track to release later this quarter. 
There are also some significant positives in our results, particularly in Enterprise. Even with the macro headwinds and product transitions I described, Enterprise yields were up 9% year-on-year for Q4 and 11% for the full year. This growth reflects good performance in both routing and switching, with the latter category up 28% in 2011. We are taking share in Enterprise business and with our stated objectives. Enterprise growth is one of several proof points that validate our strategy and reinforce the strength of our value proposition to customers. We are firmly grounded in our strategic direction, and we will continue to play offense, while managing through the current pressures in our industry. As we begin a very active 2012 period here at Juniper, I think it's a good time to refresh on the 5 key components of our strategy. 
One we are pure play in high-performance networking. All of our world-class talent is focused 100% on expanding our leadership in this category, which we firmly believe will encompass most of the networking market as the 2 megatrends of mobility and cloud computing accelerate. Two, we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly different stated products and outstanding value to our customers. Three, we are committed to leveraging our R&D investment to develop products and solutions to expand both our Service Provider customer base and our growing Enterprise customer base. Again, the trends of mobility and cloud computing make it easier for us to harness the strategy across the 2 sectors. Four, we are diversifying our customer base. We just significantly broadened our Service Provider business over the last several years, adding 155 net new Service Provider customers in 2011. We're also expanding our presence in the Enterprise, and we continue to take share. And five, we are complementing our system strategy with the Junos Space offers solutions. These solutions leverage the ones Junos platform and our highly synergistic toward systems business. We believe this strategy aligns very well with the powerful forces that are driving the new network. Innovation is that will drive long-term value-creation in networking industry. As customers abandon the complexity and unnecessary costs that plague old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across multiple dimensions of network growth. As our innovation takes hold in the market, we are seeing competition become more aggressive. This only reinforces that we're on the right track, and we need to maintain our investments and continue to innovate faster in the competition. We will stay the course that with organic R&D investment. 2012 is a major new product year for Juniper. We will be very focused on making investments that best monetize our innovations, while remaining thoughtful about spending levels across the business. It is important to recognize that Juniper's R&D commitment has rewarded the company time and time again. Five years ago we begin investing in the MX 3D Edge routing platform. We maintained our investment in MX establish Juniper 60 player as Service Provider Edge. 
Our EX switching portfolio is another example. Over a 3- to 5-year arc, the ex is further expanded our portfolio and has translated as we predicted into a share-taking position for Juniper in switching. We fully expect our new line art destination data center fabric will enable us to take that position to a new level. And of course there are some implications as we release new innovation to the market. For example, we just started shipping the T4000 as planned and this may have slowed T-Series orders over the last 6 months as customers awaited the new product. But these customers know that we're updating the performance that we deliver in the core. In Security, our customers are continuing to adopt Junos Space SRX offers. While our SRX portfolio for service providers is strong, there are some product features that we are focusing on for the Enterprise customers. You'll hear more about our action plan for security and other innovation development and special technology discussion with Stefan Dyckerhoff and Bob Muglia at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. 
So we are confident in our strategy, our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration we are achieving in both Service Provider and the Enterprise with the near-term environment remains to challenging. As we have done in the past few years we have established a set of operating principles by which we are managing through the year. For 2012, those principles are: first, we are assuming continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment; second, we plan to grow faster than the markets we serve, focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit the year; third, we will maintain investments that deliver innovation and our product roadmap; fourth, we are focused on prudent cost management; and fifth, we expect to generate solid cash flows to support our strategic needs, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As we operate the business within these principles, we are maximizing the success and accelerating the adoption of our new innovations coming to market. 
I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the customer feedback we are hearing. I'd like to share a few examples. Our T4000 routers now shipping and 2 major Service Provider customers Telefonic and Comcast placed initial orders in Q4. Our PTX trial process is going well, and we received customer orders for this product, which will ship as planned later this quarter. QFabric had its first full quarter of revenue contribution which exceeded our expectations. Most important at this stage, however, is securing early adopters for deploying QFabric and will serve as references to other interested customers. This creates and accelerates the demand cycle. We are pleased with the progress in this area as we now have a number of key customers in various stages of deployment across all 3 theaters. These wins, combined with a growing pipeline of opportunity, is also generating more and more partner retention on this important product. 
In the quarter, we released a next wave of Mobile Next features including Gateway as planned. Customers trials and third-party tests are showing that Mobile Next packet software running on an MX 3D delivers breakthrough performance results for customers. And that success is supported by an increased interest we're seeing with Service Providers. As an example, is Corporation the finished at ID services company, which has selected the Juniper networks Mobile Next portfolio as a unique mobile packet core solution in its network. 
To wrap up, we are aligned strategically to address what we firmly believe is a vibrant long-term growth opportunity in networking. There are some near-term challenges, but as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to investing in and innovation roadmap that best positions us to capture the long-term opportunity ahead. The two key trends of mobility and cloud are fully intact and in fact, are accelerating demand for the differentiated products we offer. Customers increasingly recognize that legacy networks are plagued by complexity unnecessary costs and inadequate performance. And customers around the world are embracing flatter networks of the reduced complexity and cost, while delivering dramatic improvements and performance and scale. We are the one of the very few companies delivering breakthrough technology in the networking category and we fully embrace that position. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming meeting at Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over now to Robyn to cover the results."
30439,145706832,211692,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised range as we provided in January 9. With the backdrop of continuing unc",2086,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised range as we provided in January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncertainty in the macro environment, two main factors contributed to the weakness. Firstly, our largest Service Provider customers reduced their spending expenses during the quarter, and secondly, while our Enterprise business did well, the growth was driven primarily by schedule with a softer finish than expected in other areas. 
Looking at our demand metrics, book-to-bill was 1.0 and product deferred revenue was up slightly sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. While we believe that the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact and the near-term outlook remains uncertain in this environment, a careful approach is appropriate as we anticipate the effect on customer demand and the prioritization of their investment and project deployment. We will continue to execute our strategy whilst remaining focused on prudent expense management. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $4,449,000,000, up 9% year-over-year. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter or for the full year. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 impact for restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which is unchanged sequentially and a 14% year-over-year decrease. As a reminder, last year's non-GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 favorable impact related to the renewal of the full year R&D tax credit in the quarter. 
For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $1.15 from the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19 versus $1.32 a year ago. Now let me provide you some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. 
In the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 46% of total revenue, EMEA was 36% and APAC was 18%. Americas revenue was down 6% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduction in demand from some of our largest service providers. This year-over-year decline was partially offset by a good Enterprise growth. EMEA revenue was up 28% sequentially and 11% year-over-year with both Service Provider and Enterprise gains. We saw good growth in Eastern Europe and The Netherlands. In addition, we saw the first revenue from a significant new win with the top Service Provider in Eastern Europe which spans a broad range of our product portfolio. APAC revenues decreased 16% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued weakness in Japan and the push-out of demand in China. 
Now looking at revenue by segment. Infrastructure revenue was $849,000, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router product revenue was $507 million, down 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Total MX product revenue was $255 million, up 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This reflects the healthy competitive position and incremental wins we've secured in the Edge. T-Series products were down sequentially as a result of weak overall demand it service providers, coupled with unexpected as we introduced the T4000. As planned, we shipped the first T4000 unit this quarter and expect first revenue in Q1. We also anticipate the first PTX in Q1 and both products are generating excellent customer interest. 
Total switching revenue was a record $168 million, up 28% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric and wireless LAN was $157 million, up 29% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This was driven by a strength in our EX product both in data center and campus deployment. We also recorded the initial revenues from our first deployment of our 4 QFabric solution. We are very encouraged by the strong customer interest in this disruptive technology. 
For the full year, Infrastructure revenue was $3.4 billion, up 12% from the prior year. This was comprised primarily of router product revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7%; and switching product revenue of $493 million, up 31%. 
Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $272 million, which was flat sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. For the full year, SLT revenue was just over $1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. SRX product revenue for the quarter was $81 million, down 12% from a strong third quarter. As we have noted in the past, SRX revenues will vary by quarter, influenced by the timing of high-end SRX Service Provider deployment. 
In the Enterprise, we have seen positive customer traction with the brand SRX, but the revenue growth from these products has not offset the decline of the older Enterprise security products. The Q4 release of the security design application in Junos space and the product roadmap, a promising step as we stabilize and ultimately regain growth in the Enterprise segment of the security market. We continue to see good adoption of Junos Pulse and had our first revenue from the new mobile security suite. Also, we began our first customer deployment of Mobile Next and had new video optimization design win, both of which will yield revenue this year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address. Service Provider revenue was $677 million, down 1% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Lower routing revenue was partially offset by strength in switching, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw strength in cable providers and T2 carriers. Enterprise revenue was $444 million, up 6% sequentially due primarily to strength in switching. We also saw strength in schedule in several European countries. 
Revenue was up 9% year-over-year as routing and switching growth offset a slight decline in security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 60% of total revenue and Enterprise was 40% of total revenue. For the full year, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Our increasingly diversified revenue, both in Service Provider and in Enterprise, helped offset some of the weakness with our top customers. 
Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP margins for the fourth quarter was 63.3% compared to 65.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.2% of product revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 5.1 points year-over-year. Gross margin for the quarter were negatively impacted by three mix-related factors. Firstly, a lower proportion of router sales. Secondly, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the Americas to EMEA, and lastly, a higher percentage of services in our total revenue. Performance for the year was impacted by the same factors as well as increased fixed overhead and inventory related costs. Whilst we recognize competitive positioning themselves aggressively, we've not seen any discernible difference in our discounting or in our win-loss ratio. 
Our strategy is to continue to differentiate our products through innovation and total cost of ownership. Services gross margins was 60.6%, up 3.2 points from the prior quarter and 2 points compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher overall services revenue and good cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses was flat sequentially at $501 million, driven by a lower variable compensation, offset by higher prototype and development costs and very good cost management. 
R&D expenses were down 1% from both the prior quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales at $38 million. 
Looking at headcount. We ended the year at 9,129 employees, a slight sequential decrease and a net increase of 357 heads or 4% from last year. We have slowed our hiring and are focused on the most strategic requirements as we address the near-term environment. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter was 18.6%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 5.9 points year-over-year. 
Looking at operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margins decreased 1.5 points sequentially and 9 points lower year-over-year. This was primarily due to lower revenue and product gross margin. For the full year, Infrastructure operating margin was 21% of sales, 4.4 points lower than last year. As a reminder, the results of the infrastructure segment includes routers, switches, Mobile Next and QFabric. 
SLT operating margin was 23.4%, 1.1 points lower sequentially and 3.7 points above last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, SLT operating margin was 19.4% of sales. 0.5 points lower than last year. 
The GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 23.7%, down 3.7 points from the prior quarter. This was due to our geographic mix of earnings and a onetime impact from the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of total cash and investment with approximately 50% on Our net cash and investment was $3.3 billion. DSO was 46 days in the quarter, up from 36 days last quarter but in line with Q4 last year. Cash from operations was a strong $244 million this quarter, up $58 million sequentially and down $127 million from the prior year. 
For the full year, we generated strong cash flows at $987 million from operation. Q4 CapEx totaled $78 million. For the full year CapEx was $266 million, an increase of $81 million over the prior year. This was driven primarily by the cost for our Sunnyvale camp corporate campus. Depreciation and amortization was flat with last quarter at approximately $43 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter was 533 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million from the third quarter. On a full year basis, we bought back $541 million of shares, which largely offset stock issued through our employee equity program. 
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we believe the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact, and we are confident about the growth potential of our new product portfolio. However, we are concerned by the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment and the effect it may have on the level, timing and prioritization of customer demand. Given this view, we expect Q1 2012 to be challenging. We are expecting revenues to range between $960 million and $990 million. This reflects seasonally lower Enterprise spending and continued caution by Service Providers. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%. We expect that first quarter revenue mix to have similar characteristics to last quarter's but should see progress from our continued focus on cost improvement. Operating expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as we incorporate the typical increases in employee expenses such as FICA and the reset of variable compensation. As we have done before, we will continue to make the strategic R&D and go-to-market investment that is necessary to successfully execute our strategies and capitalize on the new product cycles while carefully managing costs. As a result of lower revenue similar gross margins and higher operating expenses for the first quarter, we expect operating margin for the first quarter to range from 11% to 13%. This is expected to result in first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.11 and $0.14 per share. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. The tax rate includes an estimated $0.01 quarterly impact on EPS and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we are confident about our strategy of disruptive innovation, and our operating principles for the year position us very well going forward. In the near term, we anticipate the revenue environment will remain challenging. For the full year, we expect the to grow faster than the markets we serve based on new product cycles and conversion of current design wins. We also anticipate that we will improve our operating margin from the Q1 level throughout the year. We will navigate this near-term uncertain demand environment as we have in the past, remaining focused on prudent expense management, investing in critical areas of the business to drive growth and continuing to bring value to our customers as they address the market demands of mobile Internet and cloud computing. I want to thank our employees for their continued support, their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new network are key to our success. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

First, I think clearly, there's a shift of CapEx from wire line to wireless. And when we look at that shift, fundamentally, that plays into the architectural approach that we put together. Architecturally, when we look at that shift from wire line to wireless, we believe customers -- certainly there'll be a we've of investment around radio access networks but then as things come to the packet switched network, we believe in Fixed Mobile Convergence. So the unified Edge, which basically is what we architected the MX 3D to do to be able to handle both the wire line and wireless side. And so with that shift from wire line to wireless, we think that starts to play into the architectural value proposition that we have about helping customers collapse multiple networks into a single unified Edge, which gives them better economics in terms of carrying that traffic. In addition to that shift, there's also that trend that I think you say what is Service Provider with must work closely looking at the level of CapEx relative to revenue generation. And this is something too, that over the last 3 years we predicted as customers look at their revenues team and start to map the level of investment required to the drive that revenue. They're looking for efficiencies and efficient use of capital. We believe that too plays to our value proposition whether it's on the Edge with the unified Edge or whether in the core whether it's in the Converged Supercore and so with that market shift we think it plays to several things that have been a core part of our strategy over the last few years as we built these architectures and products. Now the question is, if you think about going through the year, when and how will CapEx unfold. First, I'll just remind you that the packet switched network a component of CapEx is a small percentage of the total Service Provider CapEx. I do believe that in talking to many customers, certainly a combination of the uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation and the implication that has on financial services and implication that has on access to capital is one of the reasons I think that service providers are being somewhat perhaps more cautious in the levels of capital expenditures, but they're also being more mindful of how those capital expenditures are aligned behind the revenue generation. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds, and our approach is going to be consistent with what we've done in the past is to remain very agile as we see that unfold yet staying true to our strategy, because we believe we have the right strategy that plays to the value proposition these customers need and are looking for, and we're going to have to just be agile as we work through the time period and see how these things start to pick up."

In terms of customers pausing for the T4000, we're expecting that in the quarter. If you recall back to last quarter's call, we had a surprisingly strong quarter in T in Q3, and we called that out. We actually were expecting a decline in the quarter and it did. In terms of the overall commentary about routing, we obviously did see that come down during the quarter as service providers change their spending intentions within the quarter. With respect to wireless LAN, I talked about the total switching growth in the quarter. We saw growth in all 3 areas of the switching of EX as well as wireless LAN as well as QFabric quarter-over-quarter. So we are pleased with the progress across the board for the switching portfolio. And with respect to MX, the strength in the quarter, we did see that come back up as we called out on the third quarter's earnings call. That's a result of both new design wins and continued deployment of existing design wins that we have on the MX side. And our view is that, that platform is very strong in the Universal Edge strategically, as Kevin commented, there is a convert from the Edge, and we believe that MX is very well-positioned for that. Kevin, anything you like to add?"

And we continue to deliver the innovation that customers need in order to do that. In terms of our pricing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not seeing any discernible difference in our discounting practices or in the win-loss ratios versus any other period of time. So there is obviously -- the competitive environment is intense but it's always been intense. So in our view is that, that hasn't changed. I think what has -- we are delivering innovation to the market that directly drives total cost of ownership different for our customers and they are seeing that translate to value for them.

In fact, the traffic driven by those market trends continues to grow. That's point number one. Point number two is the transition of how to carry that traffic to packet-switched networking, so the packet-switched networking is a subset of the total capital spent measures of these customers. And then number 3, you look at the fact that customers are trying to get more efficiency out of investment in CapEx, which in order to get that efficiency, we believe very strongly it's a combination of the architectural approach that we've taken with the new network and with the innovation that we put into our products. So we think that number one, the long-term demand trends remain strong. Number two, the customer trend and desire to get CapEx more aligned with their revenue is going to make the architectural approach and innovation we're delivering more valuable to them. And number three, I think it's going to come down to how well we compete in the markets to earn those opportunities. I do think that there will be places where they will be surgical action taken on price, but I think overall, we feel like we've got differentiation in technology and that comes from our investment in R&D.

In terms of how we're looking at things, as we've said in the prepared remarks, the demand fundamentals for the markets that we serve are absolutely intact. We continue to see progress in terms of things that are driving the demand for the new network. Our view is that -- so the first quarter service providers are going to continue to be cautious in their CapEx spending, and we also typically see a seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our Enterprise business as well. So that is what we're projecting for the first quarter in terms of guidance."

Just to add to that the microeconomic situation, I think, in Enterprise has some implications in financial services. And I think if you look at the financial services sector, you see some of the implications there. And we saw some of those customers pushed some of the deals out of Q4 into Q1, so there's some question of will they push again Q1 to Q2 depending on how things unfold in Europe. So there's a little bit of factoring that into the seasonal decline that we normally see in Enterprise from Q4 to Q1. The other factor is in Q4 of 2011, we had a very strong quarter in Federal, which was very unusual. Typically in U.S. Federal, you have your bigger quarter Q3 and then things decline in Q4, so we had a big federal quarter in Q4, which question is if the repeatable than in Q1? So there's a couple of things that I think were factored in as we look at the Q4 to Q1 guide. And then for service providers, as they're shifting to wireless oftentimes it depends customer by customer, but often times, they put a lot of capital first into the radio access network in the access side and as they do that, that's part of what that allows them to start to generate more traffic from smartphones, tablets, and as we go to LTE even significantly more traffic. And then as that cycle worst through, then it puts more traffic demands on the Edge and core the networks and that's where we play. So some of this is timing as the wireless is investments are made a nest that traffic pattern builds up. So those are a couple of factors that were part of the thinking on the guidance."

So we'll see how that unfolds for Q4, but that's part of the thesis we're watching as we're watching this unfold we had a big cycle deployments Q1 Q2 is it in the midyear 2011, the concerns about European sovereign debt and some of the other thing started to, perhaps, have some implications in the industry, and we'll see as the data comes out for Q4. Second part of your question is around M&A, and I think clearly we continue to drive a strategy that organic R&D is our primary value-creation strategy. We will continue to complement that with acquisitions. And we wanted to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to the R&D strategy that give us some how synergies in terms of the solution or the technology, the value we're delivering to customers. And I think over the last 2 years, we've done 6 or 7 different acquisitions that would be characterize probably more as tuck-ins. Things that are smaller that had intellectual property and some number of a counterbalance in the second area and it was intellectual property that was. The majority of things that we were doing in our overall organic R&D strategy.

And so that customer diversification and Service Provider, combined with our growth in the Enterprise in our diversification in the Enterprise, is the reason we have not seen a 10% customer last year. And it's possible we would have a 10% customer this year, but it's probably not a likely scenario. But we'll see how that unfolds. In terms of QFabric and your question about the strong results that we had in switching and fabric, I'll give you a little perspective. We released the QFabric nodes in Q2 or in late Q1 basically and start selling in Q2 and then we released the QFabric interconnect and director in Q3, late Q3. So Q4 was the first full quarter that we had the nodes interconnect and Director available for customer and customers. And that road map was all left plant and what we communicated when we announced QFabric. So through Q4 and Q4, we had over 100 customers of QFabric that, at a minimum, had purchased QFabric nodes and certain subset of those customers have purchased and are deploying for QFabric systems. We are very focused on working with those customers to ensure that they have a great customer experience and great early success as they adopt QFabric. And strategically, that's important because of those customers have great success to go they certainly are willing and enjoy talking to other customers and it's having those customer references where we can take a customer to go see another customers and limitation of QFabric hear directly from them, the success you're having in a good result there getting from it. That is integrating more interest and more pipeline. The increased pipeline in interest is generating now a lot of energy from our partners. We hosted our Global Partner conference last week, and we had record attendance at the Global Partner Conference. And in many cases, these are partners that some of them are new partners to Juniper and some of them have a significant business and networking today. And one of the big areas of interest for them is being able to grow their business and expand their business with new innovation like QFabric. So we're in the cycle right now where, I think, the demand and the pipeline is growing, and right now we're having to focus on how to build skills. I think now the pipeline and demand is growing at a rate, at a pace or the concern is are we now building skills and capabilities and our partner channel and certainly with the teams in the field that are working with customers to be able to continue to service that demand. So that gives you a little bit of color, a little bit of background on what we're seeing with QFabric."

The same phenomena that we had last quarter in terms of the proportion being out one quarter did not occur in the fourth quarter. So it was a one quarter phenomenon in the quarter. So we left the fiscal year of 2011 with more a normal proportion for the first quarter than we would have had if the year was ending at the end of Q3. So the backlog is healthy in terms of our first quarter. The deferred revenue balance are essentially flat year-over-year and a slight sequential increase from the third to fourth quarter. So in terms of the Q1 demand environment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting the cautious nature of the Service Provider orders to continue into the first quarter.

It doesn't feel like it's anything like as bad as that this year and yet year out in revenues are down. So I guess the question is do you agree with that and is that your opinion, you must have an opinion on your routing share, And do you think that it would make sense to get more on the pricing going forward to preserve your position in routing? And the other thing I'll just toss in there is Cisco clearly indicated more aggression starting back in September and made that happen early in the market. So it seems like they haven't been putting pressure in routing in Q4 so just address that for everyone and I think it's going to leave the call otherwise including you're losing share that would be great."

Year-to-date through Q3, our routing revenue has grown 19% versus Infonetics estimate of the addressable market growing 11%. We'll have to see what the Q4 numbers come out. I do suspect that with the T4000 releasing and the decline that we had at T-Series. We may see in the quarter that there was some share loss short-term in the quarter on T-Series as we are preparing to ship to T4000. On the MX, the MX grew and so I think on the Edge, I think, we probably are in different situation on the Edge relative to the core. So we'll have to wait and see others numbers come out, but I think, overall, we feel good about the product portfolio. We feel good about the value proposition an earlier comment I made, we are being very aware of pricing actions and what competitors are doing and specific accounts. And with the big router business and specific accounts, it's an account-by-account opportunity for us to be thoughtful about the value proposition and set of things we're doing in that account, and if we need to be surgical on price for certain things, we certainly are open and we'll be very thoughtful about doing that."

The booking rate in the fourth quarter as it relates to the book-to-bill for product being 1 was obviously slower than the third quarter. So in our view is the rate of orders from the service providers are going to continue in terms of their cautious view around CapEx for the first quarter. That is principally the reason for the reduction in terms of the guidance that we put out there on the Service Provider side. On the Enterprise side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we typically see a sequential decline between the fourth and first quarters each year. We're expecting that for the first quarter and so when you combine sequential decline for Service Provider and a sequential decline for Enterprise, we get the guidance that we've put out there."

Before we continue, I would like to highlight the reporting change that we are preparing to implement. As we discussed early last year, we are aligning our resources with our platforms and software strategy. In 2012 we will conform our financial reporting to these business segments. Under the new segment structure, we expect certain product families to be reported under new segments. We will provide you 2 years of recast quarterly history, and we'll continue to provide key product category data. 
Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.

Our results for Q4 in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance",1542,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for Q4 in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance, the near-term macro environment and industry dynamics, as well as our strategic approach, which is centered on innovation and customer value. I'll wrap up by sharing our operating principles for 2012 and update you on our innovation pipeline. 
Juniper's revenue growth was 9% for 2011. Annual revenue for 2011 represented a new record for the company. Profitability was solid, though lower than expected. Our Q4 results felt the effect of increased macro volatility that escalated over the second half of the year due to the sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slowing recoveries in APAC countries as well as the U.S. 
Here on our U.S. business, we saw a number of our largest customers reduce their spend within the quarter, including Tier 1 service providers and financial services. Though on other sectors like Federal, we saw stronger spending than expected. Another factor that played into recent results is the fact that we're entering what is surely the most exciting new product cycle in our history. As we move to the launch phase on these products, we've seen some short-term effects, particularly in core routing as customers awaited the T4000. This product is now shipping, and we are seeing very good early response. Our PTX transport core product line is also on track to release later this quarter. 
There are also some significant positives in our results, particularly in Enterprise. Even with the macro headwinds and product transitions I described, Enterprise sales were up 9% year-on-year for Q4 and 11% for the full year. This growth reflects good performance in both routing and switching, with the latter category up 28% in 2011. We are taking share in the Enterprise consistent with our stated objectives. Enterprise growth is one of several proof points that validate our strategy and reinforce the strength of our value proposition to customers. We are firmly grounded in our strategic direction, and we will continue to play offense, while managing through the current pressures in our industry. As we begin a very active 2012 here at Juniper, I think it's a good time to refresh on the 5 key components of our strategy. 
One, we are pure play in high-performance networking. All of our world-class talent is focused 100% on expanding our leadership in this category, which we firmly believe will encompass most of the networking market as the 2 megatrends of mobility and cloud computing accelerate. 
Two, we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers. 
Three, we are committed to leveraging our R&D investment to develop products and solutions that span both our Service Provider customer base and our growing Enterprise customer base. Again, the trends of mobility and cloud computing make it easier for us to harness the strategy across the 2 sectors. 
Four, we are diversifying our customer base. We just significantly broadened our Service Provider business over the last several years, adding 155 net new Service Provider customers in 2011. We're also expanding our presence in the Enterprise, and we continue to take share. 
And five, we are complementing our system strategy with the Junos Space software solutions. These solutions leverage the one Junos platform and are highly synergistic toward systems business. We believe this strategy aligns very well with the powerful forces that are driving the new network. Innovation is what will drive long-term value creation in the networking industry, as customers abandon the complexity and unnecessary costs that plague old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across multiple dimensions of network growth. As our innovation takes hold in the market, we are seeing competition become more aggressive. This only reinforces that we are on the right track, and we need to maintain our investments and continue to innovate faster than the competition. We will stay the course that with our organic R&D investment. 2012 is a major new product year for Juniper. We will be very focused on making investments that best monetize our innovations, while remaining thoughtful about spending levels across the business. It is important to recognize that Juniper's R&D commitment has rewarded the company time and time again. Five years ago we began investing in the MX 3D Edge routing platform. We maintained our investment, and MX has established Juniper as a key player to Service Provider Edge. 
Our EX switching portfolio is another example. Over a 3- to 5-year arc, the EX has further expanded our portfolio and has translated, as we predicted, into a share-taking position for Juniper in switching. We fully expect our new line of next generation data center fabric will enable us to take that position to a new level. Of course, there are some implications as we release new innovation into the market. For example, we've just started shipping the T4000 as planned, and this may have slowed T Series orders over the last 6 months as customers awaited the new product. These customers know that we are updating the performance that we deliver in the core. 
In Security, our customers are continuing to adopt Junos Space SRX offerings. While our SRX portfolio for service providers is strong, there are some product features that we are focusing on for our Enterprise customers. You'll hear more about our action plan for Security and other innovation development in a special technology discussion with Stefan Dyckerhoff and Bob Muglia at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. 
So we are confident in our strategy, our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration we are achieving in both Service Provider and the Enterprise, but the near-term environment remains challenging. As we have done in the past few years, we have established a set of operating principles by which we are managing through the year. For 2012, those principles are: first, we are assuming continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment; second, we plan to grow faster than the markets we serve, focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit the year; third, we will maintain investments that deliver innovation in our product roadmap; fourth, we are focused on prudent cost management; and fifth, we expect to generate solid cash flows to support our strategic needs, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As we operate the business within these principles, we are maximizing the success and accelerating the adoption of our new innovations coming to market. 
I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the customer feedback we are hearing. I'd like to share a few examples. Our T4000 router is now shipping, and 2 major Service Provider customers, Telefonica and Comcast, placed initial orders in Q4. Our PTX trial process is going well, and we received customer orders for this product, which will ship as planned later this quarter. QFabric had its first full quarter of revenue contribution, which exceeded our expectations. Most important at this stage, however, is securing early adopters for deploying QFabric and will serve as references to other interested customers. This creates and accelerates the demand cycle. We are pleased with the progress in this area as we now have a number of key customers in various stages of deployment across all 3 theaters. These wins, combined with the growing pipeline of opportunity, is also generating more and more partner retention on this important product. 
In the quarter, we released the next wave of Mobile Next features, including the S-gateway, as planned. Customers trials and third-party tests are showing that Mobile Next evolved packet core software running on an MX 3D delivers breakthrough performance results for customers. And that success is supported by an increased interest we are seeing with Service Providers. As an example is Elisa  Corporation, the Finnish telecoms and ICT services company, which has selected the Juniper Networks Mobile Next portfolio as a unique mobile packet core solution in its network. 
To wrap up, we are aligned strategically to address what we firmly believe is a vibrant long-term growth opportunity in networking. There are some near-term challenges, but as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to investing in an innovation roadmap that best positions us to capture the long-term opportunity ahead. The 2 key trends of mobility and cloud are fully intact and, in fact, are accelerating demand for the differentiated products we offer. Customers increasingly recognize that legacy networks are plagued by complexity unnecessary cost and inadequate performance. And customers around the world are embracing flatter networks that reduce complexity and cost, while delivering dramatic improvements in performance and scale. We are the one of the very few companies delivering breakthrough technology in the networking category, and we fully embrace that position. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming meeting at Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over now to Robyn to cover the results."

With the backdrop of continuing uncer",2099,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised ranges we provided on January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncertainty in the macro environment, 2 main factors contributed to the weakness. Firstly, our largest Service Provider customers reduced their spending intentions within the quarter. And secondly, while our Enterprise business did well, the growth was driven primarily by Federal with a softer finish than expected in other areas. 
Looking at our demand metrics, book-to-bill was 1.0 and product deferred revenue was up slightly sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. While we believe that the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact and the near-term outlook remains uncertain in this environment, a careful approach is appropriate as we anticipate the effect on customer demand and the prioritization of their investment and project deployment. We will continue to execute our strategy, whilst remaining focused on prudent expense management. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $4,449,000,000, up 9% year-over-year. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter or for the full year. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 impact for restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which is unchanged sequentially, and a $0.14 year-over-year decrease. As a reminder, last year's non-GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 favorable impact related to the renewal of the full year R&D tax credit in the quarter. 
For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $1.15 from the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19 versus $1.32 a year ago. Now let me provide you some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. 
In the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 46% of total revenue, EMEA was 36% and APAC was 18%. Americas revenue was down 6% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduction in demand by some of our largest service providers. This year-over-year decline was partially offset by good Enterprise growth. EMEA revenue was up 28% sequentially and 11% year-over-year with both Service Provider and Enterprise gains. We saw good growth in Eastern Europe and The Netherlands. In addition, we saw the first revenue from a significant new win with a top Service Provider in Eastern Europe, which spans a broad range of our product portfolio. APAC revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued weakness in Japan and the push out of some demand in China. 
Now looking at the revenue by segment. Infrastructure revenue was $849,000, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router product revenue was $507 million, down 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Total MX product revenue was $255 million, up 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This reflects the healthy competitive position and incremental wins we've secured in the Edge. T Series products were down sequentially as a result of weaker overall demand from service providers, coupled with unexpected pause as we introduced the T4000. As planned, we shipped the first T4000 units this quarter and expect first revenue in Q1. We also anticipate the first PTX shipments in Q1, and both products are generating excellent customer interest. 
Total switching revenue was a record $168 million, up 28% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric and wireless LAN, was $157 million, up 29% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This was driven by a strength in our EX product, both in data center and campus deployment. We also recorded the initial revenues from the first deployment of our 4 QFabric solution. We are very encouraged by the strong customer interest in this disruptive technology. 
For the full year, Infrastructure revenue was $3.4 billion, up 12% from the prior year. This was comprised primarily of router product revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7%; and switching product revenue of $493 million, up 31%. 
Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $272 million, which was flat sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. For the full year, SLT revenue was just over $1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. SRX product revenue for the quarter was $81 million, down 12% from a strong third quarter. As we have noted in the past, SRX revenues will vary by quarter, influenced by the timing of high-end SRX Service Provider deployment. 
In the Enterprise, we have seen positive customer traction with the branch SRX, but the revenue growth from these products has not offset the decline of the older Enterprise security products. The Q4 release of the security design application in Junos space and the product roadmap are promising steps as we stabilize and ultimately regain growth in the Enterprise segment of the security market. We continue to see good adoption of Junos Pulse and had our first revenue from the new mobile security suite. Also, we began our first customer deployment of Mobile Next and had new video optimization design win, both of which will yield revenue this year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address. Service Provider revenue was $677 million, down 1% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Lower routing revenue was partially offset by strength in switching, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw strength in sales to cable providers and T2 carriers. Enterprise revenue was $444 million, up 6% sequentially due primarily to strength in switching. We also saw strength in sales to Federal and several European countries. 
Revenue was up 9% year-over-year as routing and switching growth offset a slight decline in security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 60% of total revenue and Enterprise was 40% of total revenue. For the full year, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Our increasingly diversified revenue base, both in Service Provider and in Enterprise, helped offset some of the weakness with our top customers. 
Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP margins for the fourth quarter was 63.3% compared to 65.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.2% of product revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 5.1 points year-over-year. Gross margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by 3 mix-related factors: firstly, a lower proportion of router sales; secondly, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the Americas to EMEA; and lastly, a higher percentage of services in our total revenue. Performance for the year was impacted by these same factors, as well as increased fixed overhead and inventory-related costs. Whilst we recognize competitors are positioning themselves aggressively, we've not seen any discernible difference in our discounting or in our win-loss ratio. 
Our strategy is to continue to differentiate our products through innovation and total cost of ownership. Services gross margin was 60.6%, up 3.2 points from the prior quarter and 2 points compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher overall services revenue and good cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses was flat sequentially at $501 million, driven by lower variable compensation, offset by higher prototype and development costs and very good cost management. 
R&D expenses were down 1% from both the prior quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales at $38 million. 
Looking at headcount. We ended the year at 9,129 employees, a slight sequential decrease and a net increase of 357 heads or 4% from last year. We have slowed our hiring and are focused on the most strategic requirements as we address the near-term environment. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter was 18.6%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 5.9 points year-over-year. 
Looking at operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margin decreased 1.5 points sequentially and 9 points lower year-over-year. This was primarily due to lower revenue and product gross margin. For the full year, Infrastructure operating margin was 21% of sales, 4.4 points lower than last year. As a reminder, the results of the infrastructure segment include routers, switches, Mobile Next and QFabric. 
SLT operating margin was 23.4%, 1.1 points lower sequentially and 3.7 points above last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, SLT operating margin was 19.4% of sales. 0.5 point lower than last year. 
The GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for this quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 23.7%, down 3.7 points from the prior quarter. This was due to our geographic mix of earnings and a onetime impact from the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of total cash and investment with approximately 50% on shore. Our net cash and investment was $3.3 billion. DSO was 46 days in the quarter, up from 36 days last quarter, but in line with Q4 last year. Cash from operations was a strong $244 million this quarter, up $58 million sequentially and down $127 million from the prior year. 
For the full year, we generated strong cash flows at $987 million from operation. Q4 CapEx totaled $78 million. For the full year, CapEx was $266 million, an increase of $81 million over the prior year. This was driven primarily by the cost for our Sunnyvale camp corporate campus. 
Depreciation and amortization was flat with last quarter at approximately $43 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter was 533 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million from the third quarter. On a full year basis, we bought back $541 million of shares, which largely offset stock issued through our employee equity program. 
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we believe the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact, and we are confident about the growth potential of our new product portfolio. However, we are concerned by the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment and the effect it may have on the level, timing and prioritization of customer demand. Given this view, we expect Q1 2012 to be challenging. We are expecting revenues to range between $960 million and $990 million. This reflects seasonally lower Enterprise spending and continued caution by Service Providers. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%. We expect the first quarter's revenue mix to have similar characteristics to last quarter's, but should see progress from our continued focus on cost improvement. Operating expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as we incorporate the typical increases in employee expenses such as FICA and the reset of variable compensation. 
As we have done before, we will continue to make the strategic R&D and go-to-market investments that are necessary to successfully execute our strategies and capitalize on the new product cycles, while carefully managing costs. And as a result of lower [ph] revenue, similar gross margins and higher operating expenses for the first quarter, we expect operating margin for the first quarter to range from 11% to 13%. This is expected to result in first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.11 and $0.14 per share. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. The tax rate includes an estimated $0.01 quarterly impact on EPS and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we are confident of our strategy of disruptive innovation, and our operating principles for the year position us very well going forward. In the near term, we anticipate the revenue environment will remain challenging. For the full year, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve based on the new product cycles and the conversion of current design wins. We also anticipate that we will improve our operating margin from the Q1 level throughout the year. We will navigate this near-term uncertain demand environment as we have in the past, remaining focused on prudent expense management, investing in critical areas of the business to drive growth and continuing to bring value to our customers as they address the market demands of mobile Internet and cloud computing. I want to thank our employees for their continued support. Their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new network are keys to our success. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

First, I think clearly, there's a shift of CapEx from wireline to wireless. And when we look at that shift, fundamentally, that plays into the architectural approach that we put together. Architecturally, when we look at that shift from wireline to wireless, we believe customers -- certainly, there'll be a wave of investment around radio access networks, but then as things come to the packet-switched network, we believe in Fixed Mobile Convergence, so the unified Edge, which basically is what we architected the MX 3D to do -- was to be able to handle both the wireline and wireless side. And so with that shift from wireline to wireless, we think that starts to play into the architectural value proposition that we have about helping customers collapse multiple networks into a single unified Edge, which gives them better economics in terms of carrying that traffic. 
In addition to that shift, there's also the trend that I think you see with Service Providers where they're much more closely looking at the level of CapEx relative to revenue generation. And this is something, too, that over the last 3 years we've predicted as customers look at their revenues streams and start to map the level of investment required to drive that revenue, they're looking for efficiencies and efficient use of capital. We believe that, too, plays to our value proposition, whether it's on the Edge with the unified Edge or whether it's in the core or whether it's in the Converged Supercore. And so with that market shift, we think it plays to several things that have been a core part of our strategy over the last few years, as we've built these architectures and products. Now the question is, if you think about going through the year, when and how will CapEx unfold? 
First, I'll just remind you that the packet-switched networking component of CapEx is a small percentage of the total Service Provider CapEx. I do believe that in talking to many customers, certainly a combination of the uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation and the implication that has on financial services and the implication that has on access to capital is one of the reasons, I think, that service providers are being somewhat perhaps more cautious in the levels of capital expenditures, but they're also being more mindful of how those capital expenditures are aligned behind their revenue generation. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds, and our approach is going to be consistent with what we've done in the past, is to remain very agile as we see that unfold, yet staying true to our strategy. Because we believe we have the right strategy that plays to the value proposition these customers need and are looking for, and we're going to have to just be agile as we work through the time period and see how these things start to pick up."

So in terms of routing, as Kevin mentioned before, we are very confident in the strategies that we have both on the core and on the Edge in terms of the Universal Edge and the core. In terms of customers pausing for the T4000, we were expecting that in the quarter. If you recall back to last quarter's call, we had a surprisingly strong quarter in T in Q3, and we called that out. We actually were expecting it to decline in the quarter and it did. In terms of the overall commentary about routing, we obviously did see that come down during the quarter as service providers changed their spending intentions within the quarter. With respect to wireless LAN, I talked about the total switching growth in the quarter. We saw growth in all 3 areas of the switching of EX as well as wireless LAN as well as QFabric quarter-over-quarter. So we are pleased with the progress across the board for the switching portfolio. 
And with respect to MX, the strength in the quarter, we did see that come back up as we called out on the third quarter's earnings call. That's a result of both new design wins and continued deployment of existing design wins that we have on the MX side. And our view is that, that platform is very strong in the Universal Edge.

In fact, the traffic driven by those market trends continues to grow. That's point number one. Point number two is the transition of how to carry that traffic to packet-switched networking. So the packet-switched networking is a subset of the total capital expenditures of these customers. And then number three, you look at the fact that customers are trying to get more efficiency out of the investment in CapEx, which in order to get that efficiency, we believe very strongly it's a combination of the architectural approach that we've taken with the new network and the innovation that we put into our products. So we think that, number one, the long-term demand trends remain strong; number two, the customer trend and desire to get CapEx more aligned with their revenue is going to make the architectural approach and innovation we're delivering more valuable to them; and number three, I think it's going to come down to how well we compete in the markets to earn those opportunities. I do think that there will be places where there will be surgical action taken on price, but I think overall, we feel like we've got differentiation in technology, and that comes from our investment in R&D.

In terms of how we're looking at things, as we said in the prepared remarks, the demand fundamentals for the markets that we serve are absolutely intact. We continue to see progress in terms of things that are driving the demand for the new network. Our view is that for the first quarter, service providers are going to continue to be cautious in their CapEx spending, and we also typically see a seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our Enterprise business as well.

Just to add to that, the macroeconomic situation, I think, in the Enterprise has some implications in financial services. And I think if you look at the financial services sector, you see some of the implications there. And we saw some of those customers push some of the deals out of Q4 into Q1, so there's some question of will they push again from Q1 to Q2 depending on how things unfold in Europe. So there's a little bit of factoring that into the seasonal decline that we normally see in Enterprise from Q4 to Q1. 
The other factor is in Q4 of 2011, we had a very strong quarter in Federal, which was very unusual. Typically in U.S. Federal, you have your bigger quarter in Q3 and then things declined in Q4, so we had a big federal quarter in Q4, which question is, is that repeatable then in Q1? So there's a couple other things that I think were factored in as we looked at the Q4 to Q1 guide. And then for the service providers, as they're shifting to wireless, oftentimes -- it depends customer by customer, but oftentimes, they put a lot of capital first into the radio access network in the access side. And as they do that, that's part of what then allows them to start to generate more traffic from smartphones, tablets, and as they go to LTE even significantly more traffic. And then as that cycle works through, then it puts more traffic demands on the Edge and core of the networks, and that's where we play. So some of this is timing as the wireless investments are made and as that traffic pattern builds up. So those are a couple other factors that were part of the thinking on the guidance."

So I guess the question is what gives you confidence this is just an industry issue and not some share loss or competitive issue? And then obviously given the strong balance sheet with $4 billion in cash and investments, why would you not consider getting more aggressive on the acquisitions front and try to further diversify away from, kind of, Service Provider environment that continues to be pretty weak here?"

And the data point I look at -- we had very, very strong Q1 and Q2 on our router business. In fact, if you look at year-to-date through Q3 -- year-to-date through Q3, our outer business was up year-on-year about 19%, and the Infonetics data showed that addressable market was up about 11%. Now certainly we have to see how all the router market gets reported for Q4 and factor that in, but year-to-date through Q3, we were -- routing business was up 19% and addressable market up 11%. So we'll see how that unfolds for Q4, but that's part of -- the thesis is we're watching -- as we're watching this unfold, we had a big cycle, some big deployments in Q1, Q2, then certainly midyear 2011, the concerns about European sovereign debt and some of the other thing started to, perhaps, have some implications in the industry, and we'll see as the data comes out for Q4. 
Second part of your question is around M&A, and I think clearly we continue to drive a strategy that organic R&D is our primary value-creation strategy. We will continue to complement that with acquisitions. And we wanted to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to the R&D strategy that give us some how synergies in terms of the solution or the technology, the value that we're delivering to customers. And I think over the last 2 years, we've done 6 or 7 different acquisitions that would be characterized probably more as tuck-ins, things that were smaller that had intellectual property and some number of headcount and talent in a certain area. And it was intellectual property that was very complementary to things that we were doing in our overall organic R&D strategy. 
So I think we feel good about the architectural approach that we're taking to market and the different domains of networking that we're participating in. We feel good about this wave of new products. And we're going to always be mindful of what M&A we could do to complement our organic R&D. But I still think that the focus we have is driving an innovation agenda that comes from the talented people that are inventing new architectures and new ways to solve complex problems for our customers."

And so I was just curious if you can just give us some categorical examples of the kinds of customers that are the early adopters of QFabric, whether it's the Federal segment or Internet companies or large enterprises, et cetera."

And that strategy is much about Service Provider as it is about Enterprise. And we've expanded our go-to-market model in the Service Provider sector, where we are now reaching out to -- with our partners and others to a larger number of service providers, smaller service providers, the Tier 3 service providers that still make a significant amount of investments in our technology. And so that customer diversification and Service Provider, combined with our growth in the Enterprise and our diversification in the Enterprise, is the reason we have not seen a 10% customer last year. And it's possible we would have a 10% customer this year, but it's probably not a likely scenario. But we'll see how that unfolds. 
In terms of QFabric and your question about the strong results that we had in switching and fabric, I'll give you a little perspective. We released the QFabric nodes in Q2 or in late Q1, basically, and started selling in Q2, and then we released the QFabric Interconnect and Director in Q3, late Q3. So Q4 was the first full quarter that we had the nodes Interconnect and Director available for customer and customers. And that road map was all as planned and what we communicated when we announced QFabric. So through Q4 and Q4, we had over 100 customers of QFabric that, at a minimum, had purchased QFabric nodes. And a certain subset of those customers have purchased and are deploying the full QFabric systems. We are very focused on working with those customers to ensure that they have a great customer experience and great early success as they adopt QFabric. 
And strategically, that's important because those customers that have great success, they certainly are willing and enjoy talking to other customers, and it's having those customer references where we can take a customer to go see another customer's implementation of QFabric, hear directly from them, the success that they're having and the good results that they're getting from it, that is in turn creating more interest and more pipeline. The increased pipeline in interest is generating now a lot of energy from our partners. We hosted our Global Partner Conference last week, and we had record attendance at the Global Partner Conference. And in many cases, these are partners that -- some of them are new partners to Juniper and some of them have a significant business and networking today. And one of the big areas of interest for them is being able to grow their business and expand their business with new innovation like QFabric. So we're in the cycle right now where, I think, the demand in the pipeline is growing. And right now we're having to focus on how to build skills. I think now the pipeline and demand is growing at a rate, at a pace where the concern is, are we now building enough skills and capabilities in our partner channel and certainly with the teams in the field that are working with customers to be able to continue to service that demand? So that gives you a little bit of color, a little bit of background on what we're seeing with QFabric."

And then the second question would be, I know it's early, but based on your discussions with your carrier customers, what do you see that carrier routing market growing this year? Your total router revenue growth about 7% in the full year of 2011.

In terms of the conversion of book-to-bill, yes, the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.0, so equal to revenue for product book-to-bill. We did have a sequential increase in product-deferred revenue, a slight increase of about 3%. We have grown the backlog. The same phenomena that we had last quarter in terms of the proportion being out. One quarter did not occur in the fourth quarter, so it was a one-quarter phenomenon in the third quarter. So we left the fiscal year of 2011 with a more normal proportion for the first quarter than we would have had if the year was ending at the end of Q3. So the backlog is healthy in terms of our first quarter, the deferred revenue balances are essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight sequential increase from the third to fourth quarter. So in terms of the Q1 demand environment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting the cautious nature of the Service Provider orders to continue into the first quarter. Obviously with the book-to-bill of 1, you can calculate how many orders we got in the fourth quarter for products. So our view is that continues through the first quarter."

Just because the last 2x we've seen carrier routing, the market declined, as Brent indicated, in 2008 and 2001, so those are pretty tough years. It doesn't feel like it's anything like as bad as that this year, and yet your routing revenues are down. So I guess the question is, do you agree with that? And is that your opinion? You must have an opinion on your routing share. And do you think that it would make sense to get more aggressive on the pricing going forward to preserve your position in routing? And the other thing I'll just toss in there is Cisco clearly indicated more aggression starting back in September. And maybe that happened early in the market, so it seems like they have been putting more pressure on routing in Q4.

So -- and our view is the rate of orders from the service providers are going to continue in terms of their cautious view around CapEx for the first quarter. That is principally the reason for the reduction in terms of the guidance that we put out there on the Service Provider side. 
On the Enterprise side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we typically see a sequential decline between the fourth and first quarters each year. We're expecting that for the first quarter.

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.

All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.

Our results for Q4 are in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 perform",1540,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for Q4 are in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance, the near-term macro environment and industry dynamics, as well as our strategic approach, which is centered on innovation and customer value. I'll wrap up by sharing our operating principles for 2012, and update you on our innovation pipeline. 
Juniper's revenue growth was 9% for 2011. Annual revenue for 2011 represented a new record for the company. Profitability was solid, though lower than expected. Our Q4 results felt the effect of increased macro volatility that escalated over the second half of the year due to the sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slowing recoveries in APAC countries as well as the U.S. 
Here on our U.S. business, we saw a number of our largest customers reduce their spend within the quarter, including Tier 1 service providers and financial services. Though on other sectors like Federal, we saw stronger spending than expected. Another factor that played into recent results is the fact that we're entering what is surely the most exciting new product cycle in our history. As we move through the launch phase on these products, we've seen some short-term effects, particularly in core routing as customers awaited the T4000. This product is now shipping, and we are seeing very good early response. Our PTX transport core product line is also on track to release later this quarter. 
There are also some significant positives in our results, particularly in Enterprise. Even with the macro headwinds and product transitions I described, Enterprise sales were up 9% year-on-year for Q4 and 11% for the full year. This growth reflects good performance in both routing and switching, with the latter category up 28% in 2011. We are taking share in the Enterprise consistent with our stated objectives. Enterprise growth is one of several proof points that validate our strategy and reinforce the strength of our value proposition to customers. We are firmly grounded in our strategic direction, and we will continue to play offense, while managing through the current pressures in our industry. As we begin a very active 2012 here at Juniper, I think it's a good time to refresh on the 5 key components of our strategy. 
One, we are pure play in high-performance networking. All of our world-class talent is focused 100% on expanding our leadership in this category, which we firmly believe will encompass most of the networking market as the 2 megatrends of mobility and Cloud computing accelerate. 
Two, we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers. 
Three, we are committed to leveraging our R&D investment to develop products and solutions that span both our Service Provider customer base and our growing Enterprise customer base. Again, the trends of mobility and Cloud computing make it easier for us to harness the strategy across the 2 sectors. 
Four, we are diversifying our customer base. We have significantly broadened our Service Provider business over the last several years, adding 155 net new Service Provider customers in 2011. We're also expanding our presence in the Enterprise, and we continue to take share. 
And five, we are complementing our system strategy with the Junos Space software solutions. These solutions leverage the one Junos platform and are highly synergistic toward systems business. We believe this strategy aligns very well with the powerful forces that are driving the new network. Innovation is what will drive long-term value creation in the networking industry, as customers abandon the complexity and unnecessary costs that plague old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across multiple dimensions of network growth. As our innovation takes hold in the market, we are seeing competition become more aggressive. This only reinforces that we are on the right track, and we need to maintain our investments and continue to innovate faster than the competition. We will stay the course with our organic R&D investment. 2012 is a major new product year for Juniper. We will be very focused on making investments that best monetize our innovations, while remaining thoughtful about spending levels across the business. It is important to recognize that Juniper's R&D commitment has rewarded the company time and time again. Five years ago we began investing in the MX 3D Edge routing platform. We maintained our investment, and MX has established Juniper as a key player to Service Provider Edge. 
Our EX switching portfolio is another example. Over a 3- to 5-year arc, the EX has further expanded our portfolio and has translated, as we predicted, into a share-taking position for Juniper in switching. We fully expect our new line of next generation data center fabric will enable us to take that position to a new level. Of course, there are some implications as we release new innovation into the market. For example, we've just started shipping the T4000 as planned, and this may have slowed T Series orders over the last 6 months as customers awaited the new product. These customers know that we are updating the performance that we deliver in the core. 
In Security, our customers are continuing to adopt Junos Space SRX offerings. While our SRX portfolio for service providers is strong, there are some product features that we are focusing on for our Enterprise customers. You'll hear more about our action plan for Security and other innovation development in a special technology discussion with Stefan Dyckerhoff and Bob Muglia at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. 
So we are confident in our strategy, our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration we are achieving in both Service Provider and the Enterprise, but the near-term environment remains challenging. As we have done in the past few years, we have established a set of operating principles by which we are managing through the year. For 2012, those principles are: first, we are assuming continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment; second, we plan to grow faster than the markets we serve, focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit the year; third, we will maintain investments that deliver innovation in our product roadmap; fourth, we are focused on prudent cost management; and fifth, we expect to generate solid cash flows to support our strategic needs, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As we operate the business within these principles, we are maximizing the success and accelerating the adoption of our new innovations coming to market. 
I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the customer feedback we are hearing. I'd like to share a few examples. Our T4000 router is now shipping, and 2 major Service Provider customers, Telefonica and Comcast, placed initial orders in Q4. Our PTX trial process is going well, and we received customer orders for this product, which will ship as planned later this quarter. QFabric had its first full quarter of revenue contribution, which exceeded our expectations. Most important at this stage, however, is securing early adopters for deploying QFabric and will serve as references to other interested customers. This creates and accelerates the demand cycle. We are pleased with the progress in this area as we now have a number of key customers in various stages of deployment across all 3 theaters. These wins, combined with the growing pipeline of opportunity, is also generating more and more partner attention on this important product. 
In the quarter, we released the next wave of Mobile Next features, including the S-gateway, as planned. Customers trial and third-party tests are showing that MobileNext evolved packet core software running on an MX 3D delivers breakthrough performance results for customers. And that success is supported by an increased interest we are seeing with Service Providers. As an example is Elisa Corporation, the Finnish telecoms and ICT services company, which has selected the Juniper Networks MobileNext portfolio as a unique mobile packet core solution in its network. 
To wrap up, we are aligned strategically to address what we firmly believe is a vibrant long-term growth opportunity in networking. There are some near-term challenges, but as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to investing in an innovation roadmap that best positions us to capture the long-term opportunity ahead. The 2 key trends of mobility and Cloud are fully intact and, in fact, are accelerating demand for the differentiated products we offer. Customers increasingly recognize that legacy networks are plagued by complexity, unnecessary cost and inadequate performance. And customers around the world are embracing flatter networks that reduce complexity and cost, while delivering dramatic improvements in performance and scale. We are the one of the very few companies delivering breakthrough technology in the networking category, and we fully embrace that position. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming meeting at Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over now to Robyn to cover the results."
30439,145706832,211879,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised ranges we provided on January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncer",2098,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised ranges we provided on January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncertainty in the macro environment, 2 main factors contributed to the weakness. Firstly, our largest Service Provider customers reduced their spending intentions within the quarter. And secondly, while our Enterprise business did well, the growth was driven primarily by Federal, with a softer finish than expected in other areas. 
Looking at our demand metrics, book-to-bill was 1.0 and product deferred revenue was up slightly sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. While we believe that the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact and the near-term outlook remains uncertain, in this environment a careful approach is appropriate as we anticipate the effect on customer demand and the prioritization of their investment and project deployment. We will continue to execute our strategy, whilst remaining focused on prudent expense management. 
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $4,449,000,000, up 9% year-over-year. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter or for the full year. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 impact for restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which is unchanged sequentially, and a $0.14 year-over-year decrease. As a reminder, last year's non-GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 favorable impact related to the renewal of the full year R&D tax credit in the quarter. 
For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.79 compared to $1.15 from the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19 versus $1.32 a year ago. Now let me provide you some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. 
In the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 46% of total revenue, EMEA was 36% and APAC was 18%. Americas revenue was down 6% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduction in demand by some of our largest Service Providers. This year-over-year decline was partially offset by good Enterprise growth. EMEA revenue was up 28% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with both Service Provider and Enterprise gains. We saw good growth in Eastern Europe and The Netherlands. In addition, we saw the first revenue from a significant new win with a top Service Provider in Eastern Europe, which spans a broad range of our product portfolio. APAC revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued weakness in Japan and the push out of some demand in China. 
Now looking at the revenue by segment. Infrastructure revenue was $849 million, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router product revenue was $507 million, down 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Total MX product revenue was $255 million, up 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This reflects the healthy competitive position and incremental wins we've secured in the Edge. T Series products were down sequentially as a result of weaker overall demand from Service Providers, coupled with unexpected pause as we introduced the T4000. As planned, we shipped the first T4000 units this quarter and expect first revenue in Q1. We also anticipate the first PTX shipments in Q1, and both products are generating excellent customer interest. 
Total switching revenue was a record $168 million, up 28% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric and wireless LAN, was $157 million, up 29% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This was driven by a strength in our EX product, both in data center and campus deployment. We also recorded the initial revenues from the first deployment of our full QFabric solution. We are very encouraged by the strong customer interest in this disruptive technology. 
For the full year, Infrastructure revenue was $3.4 billion, up 12% from the prior year. This was comprised primarily of router product revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7%; and switching product revenue of $493 million, up 31%. 
Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $272 million, which was flat sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. For the full year, SLT revenue was just over $1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. SRX product revenue for the quarter was $81 million, down 12% from a strong third quarter. As we have noted in the past, SRX revenues will vary by quarter, influenced by the timing of high-end SRX Service Provider deployment. 
In the Enterprise, we have seen positive customer traction with the branch SRX, but the revenue growth from these products has not offset the decline of the older Enterprise security products. The Q4 release of the security design application in Junos Space, and the product roadmap are promising steps as we stabilize and ultimately regain growth in the Enterprise segment of the security market. We continue to see good adoption of Junos Pulse and had our first revenue from the new mobile security suite. Also, we began our first customer deployment of MobileNext and had new video optimization design wins, both of which will yield revenue this year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address. Service Provider revenue was $677 million, down 1% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Lower routing revenue was partially offset by strength in switching, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw strength in sales to cable providers and T2 carriers. Enterprise revenue was $444 million, up 6% sequentially, due primarily to strength in switching. We also saw strength in sales to Federal and several European countries. 
Revenue was up 9% year-over-year as routing and switching growth offset a slight decline in security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 60% of total revenue and Enterprise was 40% of total revenue. For the full year, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Our increasingly diversified revenue base, both in Service Provider and in Enterprise, helped offset some of the weakness with our top customers. 
Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP margins for the fourth quarter were 63.3% compared to 65.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.2% of product revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 5.1 points year-over-year. Gross margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by 3 mix-related factors: firstly, a lower proportion of router sales; secondly, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the Americas to EMEA; and lastly, a higher percentage of services in our total revenue. Performance for the year was impacted by these same factors, as well as increased fixed overhead and inventory-related costs. Whilst we recognize competitors are positioning themselves aggressively, we've not seen any discernible difference in our discounting or in our win-loss ratio. 
Our strategy is to continue to differentiate our products through innovation and total cost of ownership. Services gross margin were 60.6%, up 3.2 points from the prior quarter and 2 points compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher overall services revenue and good cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $501 million, driven by lower variable compensation, offset by higher prototype and development costs, and very good cost management. 
R&D expenses were down 1% from both the prior quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales at $38 million. 
Looking at headcount. We ended the year at 9,129 employees, a slight sequential decrease and a net increase of 357 heads or 4% from last year. We have slowed our hiring and are focused on the most strategic requirements as we address the near-term environment. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter was 18.6%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 5.9 points year-over-year. 
Looking at operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margin decreased 1.5 points sequentially and 9 points lower year-over-year. This was primarily due to lower revenue and product gross margins. For the full year, Infrastructure operating margin was 21% of sales, 4.4 points lower than last year. As a reminder, the results of the infrastructure segment include routers, switchers, MobileNext and QFabric. 
SLT operating margin was 23.4%, 1.1 points lower sequentially and 3.7 points above last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, SLT operating margin was 19.4% of sales, 0.5 point lower than last year. 
The GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 23.7%, down 3.7 points from the prior quarter. This was due to our geographic mix of earnings and a onetime impact from the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of total cash and investment with approximately 50% on shore. Our net cash and investment was $3.3 billion. DSO was 46 days in the quarter, up from 36 days last quarter, but in line with Q4 last year. Cash from operations was a strong $244 million this quarter, up $58 million sequentially and down $127 million from the prior year. 
For the full year, we generated strong cash flows at $987 million from operations. Q4 CapEx totaled $78 million. For the full year, CapEx was $266 million, an increase of $81 million over the prior year. This was driven primarily by the cost for our Sunnyvale camp -- corporate campus. 
Depreciation and amortization was flat with last quarter at approximately $43 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter were 533 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million from the third quarter. On a full year basis, we bought back $541 million of shares, which largely offset stock issued through our employee equity program. 
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we believe the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact, and we are confident about the growth potential of our new product portfolio. However, we are concerned by the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment and the effect it may have on the level, timing and prioritization of customer demand. Given this view, we expect Q1 2012 to be challenging. We are expecting revenues to range between $960 million and $990 million. This reflects seasonally lower Enterprise spending and continued caution by Service Providers. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%. We expect the first quarter's revenue mix to have similar characteristics to last quarter's, but should see progress from our continued focus on cost improvement. Operating expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as we incorporate the typical increases in employee expenses such as FICA and the reset of variable compensation. 
As we have done before, we will continue to make the strategic R&D and go-to-market investments that are necessary to successfully execute our strategies and capitalize on the new product cycles, while carefully managing costs. And as a result of lower revenue, similar gross margins and higher operating expenses for the first quarter, we expect operating margins for the first quarter to range from 11% to 13%. This is expected to result in first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.11 and $0.14 per share. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. The tax rate includes an estimated $0.01 quarterly impact on EPS, and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we are confident of our strategy of disruptive innovation, and our operating principles for the year position us very well going forward. In the near term, we anticipate the revenue environment will remain challenging. For the full year, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve based on the new product cycles and the conversion of current design wins. We also anticipate that we will improve our operating margin from the Q1 level throughout the year. We will navigate this near-term uncertain demand environment as we have in the past, remaining focused on prudent expense management, investing in critical areas of the business to drive growth and continuing to bring value to our customers as they address the market demands of mobile Internet and Cloud computing. I want to thank our employees for their continued support. Their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new network are keys to our success. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

First, I think clearly, there's a shift of CapEx from wireline to wireless. And when we look at that shift, fundamentally, that plays into the architectural approach that we put together. Architecturally, when we look at that shift from wireline to wireless, we believe customers -- certainly, there'll be a wave of investment around radio access networks, but then as things come to the packet-switched network, we believe in Fixed Mobile Convergence, so the unified Edge, which basically is what we architected the MX 3D to do -- was to be able to handle both the wireline and wireless side. And so with that shift from wireline to wireless, we think that starts to play into the architectural value proposition that we have about helping customers collapse multiple networks into a single unified Edge, which gives them better economics in terms of carrying that traffic. 
In addition to that shift, there's also the trend that I think you see with Service Providers where they're much more closely looking at the level of CapEx relative to revenue generation. And this is something, too, that over the last 3 years we've predicted as customers look at their revenues streams and start to map the level of investment required to drive that revenue, they're looking for efficiencies and efficient use of capital. We believe that, too, plays to our value proposition, whether it's on the Edge with the unified Edge or whether it's in the core or whether it's in the Converged Supercore. And so with that market shift, we think it plays to several things that have been a core part of our strategy over the last few years, as we've built these architectures and products. Now the question is, if you think about going through the year, when and how will CapEx unfold? 
First, I'll just remind you that the packet-switched networking component of CapEx is a small percentage of the total Service Provider CapEx. I do believe that in talking to many customers, certainly a combination of the uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation, and the implication that has on financial services and the implication that has on access to capital is one of the reasons, I think, that Service Providers are being somewhat perhaps more cautious in the levels of capital expenditures, but they're also being more mindful of how those capital expenditures are aligned behind their revenue generation. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds, and our approach is going to be consistent with what we've done in the past, is to remain very agile as we see that unfold, yet staying true to our strategy. Because we believe we have the right strategy that plays to the value proposition these customers need and are looking for, and we're going to have to just be agile as we work through the time period and see how these things start to pick up."

We actually were expecting it to decline in the quarter and it did. In terms of the overall commentary about routing, we obviously did see that come down during the quarter as service providers changed their spending intentions within the quarter. With respect to wireless LAN, I talked about the total switching growth in the quarter. We saw growth in all 3 areas of the switching of EX, as well as wireless LAN as well as QFabric quarter-over-quarter. So we are pleased with the progress across the board for the switching portfolio. 
And with respect to MX, the strength in the quarter, we did see that come back up as we called out on the third quarter's earnings call.

In fact, the traffic driven by those market trends continues to grow. That's point number one. Point number two is the transition of how to carry that traffic to packet-switched networking. So the packet-switched networking is a subset of the total capital expenditures of these customers. And then number three, you look at the fact that customers are trying to get more efficiency out of the investment in CapEx, which in order to get that efficiency, we believe very strongly it's a combination of the architectural approach that we've taken with the new network and the innovation that we put into our products. So we think that, number one, the long-term demand trends remain strong; number two, the customer trend and desire to get CapEx more aligned with their revenue is going to make the architectural approach and innovation we're delivering more valuable to them; and number three, I think it's going to come down to how well we compete in the market to earn those opportunities. I do think that there will be places where there will be surgical action taken on price, but I think overall, we feel like we've got differentiation in technology, and that comes from our investment in R&D. And so we've got to lead with that value. And then at the same time, look, we're very aware of the market situation. We're very aware of customers, and we are playing offense. So we'll see how things unfold."

So in terms of the guidance, we've taken the same approach to our guidance for the first quarter as we typically do. Obviously we always look to refine the approach and improve it and make sure that we're looking at different things from a process perspective, but the philosophy and the approach to the first quarter guidance is consistent with what we've done previously. In terms of how we're looking at things, as we said in the prepared remarks, the demand fundamentals for the markets that we serve are absolutely intact. We continue to see progress in terms of things that are driving the demand for the new network. Our view is that for the first quarter, Service Providers are going to continue to be cautious in their CapEx spending, and we also typically see a seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our Enterprise business as well. So that is what we're projecting for the first quarter in terms of guidance."

Just to add to that, the macroeconomic situation, I think, in the Enterprise has some implications in financial services. And I think if you look at the financial services sector, you see some of the implications there. And we saw some of those customers push some of the deals out of Q4 into Q1, so there's some question of will they push again from Q1 to Q2, depending on how things unfold in Europe. So there's a little bit of factoring that into the seasonal decline that we normally see in Enterprise from a Q4 to Q1. 
The other factor is in Q4 of 2011, we had a very strong quarter in Federal, which was very unusual. Typically in U.S. Federal, you have your bigger quarter in Q3 and then things decline in Q4, so we had a big federal quarter in Q4, which question is, is that repeatable then in Q1? So there's a couple other things that I think were factored in as we looked at the Q4 to Q1 guide. And then for the Service Providers, as they're shifting to wireless, oftentimes -- it depends customer by customer, but oftentimes, they put a lot of capital first into the radio access network in the access side. And as they do that, that's part of what then allows them to start to generate more traffic from smartphones, tablets, and as they go to LTE even significantly more traffic. And then as that cycle works through, then it puts more traffic demands on the Edge and core of the networks, and that's where we play. So some of this is timing as the wireless investments are made and as that traffic pattern builds up. So those are a couple other factors that were part of the thinking on the guidance."

We've really never seen this 5-quarter, kind of, consecutive decline in the business, and I went back 10 years. So I guess the question is what gives you confidence this is just an industry issue and not some share loss or competitive issue? And then obviously given the strong balance sheet with $4 billion in cash and investments, why would you not consider getting more aggressive on the acquisitions front and try to further diversify away from, kind of, Service Provider environment that continues to be pretty weak here?"

In fact, if you look at year-to-date through Q3 -- year-to-date through Q3, our router business was up year-on-year about 19%, and the Infonetics data showed that addressable market was up about 11%. Now certainly we have to see how all the router market gets reported for Q4 and factor that in, but year-to-date through Q3, we were -- routing business was up 19% and addressable market up 11%. So we'll see how that unfolds for Q4, but that's part of -- the thesis is we're watching -- as we're watching this unfold, we had a big cycle, some big deployments in Q1, Q2, then certainly midyear 2011, the concerns about European sovereign debt and some of the other thing started to, perhaps, have some implications in the industry, and we'll see as the data comes out for Q4. 
Second part of your question is around M&A, and I think clearly we continue to drive a strategy that organic R&D is our primary value-creation strategy. We will continue to complement that with acquisitions. And we wanted to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to the R&D strategy, that give us some how synergies in terms of the solution or the technology, the value that we're delivering to customers. And I think over the last 2 years, we've done 6 or 7 different acquisitions that would be characterized probably more as tuck-ins, things that were smaller that had intellectual property and some number of headcount and talent in a certain area. And it was intellectual property that was very complementary to things that we were doing in our overall organic R&D strategy. 
So I think we feel good about the architectural approach that we're taking to market and the different domains of networking that we're participating in. We feel good about this wave of new products. And we're going to always be mindful of what M&A we could do to complement our organic R&D. But I still think that the focus we have is driving an innovation agenda that comes from the talented people that are inventing new architectures and new ways to solve complex problems for our customers."

And that's a strategy as much about Service Providers as it is about Enterprise. And we've expanded our go-to-market model in the Service Provider sector, where we are now reaching out to -- with our partners and others to a larger number of Service Providers -- smaller Service Providers, the Tier 3 Service Providers that still make a significant amount of investments in our technology. And so that customer diversification and Service Provider, combined with our growth in the Enterprise and our diversification in the Enterprise, is the reason we have not seen a 10% customer last year. And it's possible we would have a 10% customer this year, but it's probably not a likely scenario. But we'll see how that unfolds. 
In terms of QFabric, and your question about the strong results that we had in switching and fabric, I'll give you a little perspective. We released the QFabric nodes in Q2 -- or in late Q1, basically, and started selling in Q2, and then we released the QFabric Interconnect and Director in Q3, late Q3. So Q4 was the first full quarter that we had the nodes Interconnect and Director available for customer and customers. And that roadmap was all as planned and what we communicated when we announced QFabric. So through Q4 and Q4, we had over 100 customers of QFabric that, at a minimum, had purchased QFabric nodes. And a certain subset of those customers have purchased and are deploying the full QFabric systems. We are very focused on working with those customers to ensure that they have a great customer experience and great early success as they adopt QFabric. 
And strategically, that's important because those customers that have great success, they certainly are willing and enjoy talking to other customers, and it's having those customer references where we can take a customer to go see another customer's implementation of QFabric, hear directly from them, the success that they're having and the good results that they're getting from it, that is in turn creating more interest and more pipeline. The increased pipeline in interest is generating now a lot of energy from our partners. We hosted our Global Partner Conference last week, and we had record attendance at the Global Partner Conference. And in many cases, these are partners that -- some of them are new partners to Juniper and some of them have a significant business and networking today. And one of the big areas of interest for them is being able to grow their business and expand their business with new innovation like QFabric. So we're in the cycle right now where, I think, the demand in the pipeline is growing. And right now we're having to focus on how to build skills. I think now the pipeline and demand is growing at a rate, at a pace where the concern is, are we now building enough skills and capabilities in our partner channel and certainly with the teams in the field that are working with customers to be able to continue to service that demand? So that gives you a little bit of color, a little bit of background on what we're seeing with QFabric."

The same phenomena that we had last quarter in terms of the proportion being out. One quarter did not occur in the fourth quarter, so it was a one-quarter phenomenon in the third quarter. So we left the fiscal year of 2011 with a more normal proportion for the first quarter than we would have had if the year was ending at the end of Q3. So the backlog is healthy in terms of our first quarter, the deferred revenue balances are essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight sequential increase from the third to fourth quarter. So in terms of the Q1 demand environment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting the cautious nature of the Service Provider orders to continue into the first quarter.

So if anything, I think, despite, sort of, negative seasonality, you should have a little bit of a better Q1 outlook. 
And then second question is just taking up a previous question on, sort of, the growth for 2012. I know you are suggesting that you're going to grow faster than the market. I'm just curious to get your take on what you're thinking about the growth rate for the overall market. I mean, are you thinking the market grows 10% north of that, south of that?

The booking rate in the fourth quarter as it relates to the book-to-bill for product being 1 was obviously slower than the third quarter. So -- and our view is the rate of orders from the Service Providers are going to continue in terms of their cautious view around CapEx for the first quarter. That is principally the reason for the reduction in terms of the guidance that we put out there on the Service Provider side. 
On the Enterprise side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we typically see a sequential decline between the fourth and first quarters each year. We're expecting that for the first quarter. And so when you combine a sequential decline for Service Provider and a sequential decline for Enterprise, we get the guidance that we've put out there."

Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System. 
Before Kevin get started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platform Systems division, which will often be referred to as PSD and Software Solutions division or SSD. Our press release provide description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in appendix to, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security. 
The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment. 
The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under this historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. information including 2011 and 2010  announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses. 
Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. 
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin."

Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we are seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan who heads our Platform Systems division to provide some further depth to the progress we're making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review.
First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA as expected, but we saw good wins in activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings. 
In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update give the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment. 
Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue. The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, which is the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core ad the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business. 
Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority that drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solutions. 
The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments. 
Within security, we continued to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities. 
Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions were delivering and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing support that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements. 
One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing. 
Two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value. 
Three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base. 
Four, we are diversifying the customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise. 
And five, we are complementing in our system strategy with the software business centered on the One Junos platform. 
Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continues caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles. 
Trends of mobile Internet and cloud have great in the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. With that, I'll hand off to Stefan."

As we articulat",953,"Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress Bob Muglia, and I have the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experience as of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions. 
We have aligned organizational structure to new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platform Systems division and the Software Solutions division which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions to the customer lens, segmented by network domain. 
We are innovation-driven company which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we are proud to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX will all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments. 
We now have the strongest, most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we're taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core. 
Several customers have embraced our vision of Converged Supercore, and we're seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based Telstra and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product. 
We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch fabric upgrades we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for 100 gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter. 
With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100 gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100 gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper in combined with the ACX product line for access and allegation, which will ship this year we see continued growth opportunities across wireless and wireline applications. 
Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric. Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive to the Enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next generation data center networks to 1 layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtuous data center and emerging clouds. 
We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response for this technology since we introduced at last year. We now have over 150 customers for the FX product line and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments. We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include 360 in China and Australia-based oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric winning Europe at Uberlândia hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall was good and very encouraged by the pipeline we are building. 
So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center in campus and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction. One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products. The Trio Chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset optimize the high-capacity transport is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D programs delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation. 
I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their need, and as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda. I will now turn the call over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges.

Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our new products reflected in orders for PTX, T4000 and QFabric. While we are still in the early phases of these new product cycles, customer feedback on our disruptive innovation is highly encouraging. 
We saw a sequential increase in Service Provider revenue, driven primarily by large U.S. customers. As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing. While we believe long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near-term. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. The margin continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. 
For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down in equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margin. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. Service Providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers. 
EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in southern and parts of Central Europe. 
APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region. 
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers. Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX45 and EX2200 as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution. 
Software Solutions division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployment. Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the future offering of our Enterprise security customer. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing. Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security. 
For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue. 
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix as well as inventory-related costs. 
Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the of variable compensation and an increase in parts related to the new product introductions. While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvement throughout our supply chain. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objective. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins. Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization. 
For PSD, contribution margin was 37%, and for SSD contribution margin was 39%. The sequential declines for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the asset of BitGravity. Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semiannual bond interest payment. 
DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year. CapEx and depreciation was consistent with prior quarters. We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock program. 
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics provided a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near- and long-term. 
Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter. As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovation. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business. I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observed. One is that with our large U.S. Tier 1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that it's reverting back to more seasonal pattern that we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new product and market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural design win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus.

How should we think about getting a return on those investments? And is this is kind of the bottom, and we should start to see a more rationalization of the R&D expenses going forward?

Certainly, we are at interesting point in the evolution of the company and that we just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in all those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense and below that higher as a percentage of revenue that we would like long-term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly it's up to us to really drive execution and market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders."

So in terms of the headline gross margin number, 62.6, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter but it was mainly the result. In fact, primarily the result of the Services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with Services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in fair parts as we're bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from a overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we will also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well."

Our CTO percentage together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about STN, I see a lot of goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences, and our innovation top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK to supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BTE or PCE. We are continue to focus on the programmability as well as the one key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say okay. What's the use of that technology in the data center. One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure also drives performance in the network. So a flat any connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customer, so we have a mix of deployment for the customers have adopted that the QFX product line. There range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they wanted to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as the adopted a key piece of technology and there is a good number of them that actually adopted a full farm fabric and as I mentioned the first in light of the boy made as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there and just to continue to focus on execution with the customer engagement."

The primary reason for that is Q1 of last year, which was pre-tsunami, if you remember tsunami was 03/11. We actually had completed in the first quarter a large Service Provider deployment in Japan.

And so when markets expand faster that gives us more opportunity to grow and they expense lower amount would you think we're in a growth market but frankly the focus is going to be as the operating principle states, which is growing faster than the market. And then the second part of your question is the way to drive operating leverage on the up margin is to drive the top line revenue by monetizing this great set of new products that we just released in the marketplace. And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and software, put together were in the architectural approach another we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D.

In terms of the revenue guidance for the second quarter, we are looking at flat to slightly up in terms of revenue overall.

In terms of the overall gross margins, I think you talked about -- it was pricing. The pricing environment, as I mentioned, in the last question on gross margins, it's obviously a competitive environment. It has been, for quite some time, in terms of the market dynamics but it hasn't changed our philosophy in terms of delivering innovation to the market and that'll cost of ownership for our customers. I mean clearly as Kevin has mentioned before on the earnings call, we will compete on price to win new customers on a selective basis. And so we will continue to do that on a selective basis, particularly as it relates to extending our reach into certain customers and certain markets and geographies. But overall, the market environment is pretty consistent with what it's been over the last number of quarters."

Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System.
Before Kevin get started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platforms Systems Division, which will often be referred to as PSD, and Software Solutions Division, or SSD. 
Our press release provides a description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in Appendix 2, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security.
The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products, such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and J-Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment.
The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products, such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. Detailed information including 2011 and 2010 announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the Appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses.
Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply-chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. 
GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. 
Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions]

Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we're seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan Dyckerhoff, who heads our Platforms Systems Division, to provide some further depth from the progress we are making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review.
First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA, as expected. But we saw good wins and activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings.
In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update of the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment.
Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue. 
The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, such as the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core and the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost per bit of traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business.
Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority of the drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solution.
The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments.
Within security, we continue to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are a result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities.
Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions we are delivering, and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing supports that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements. 
One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing; two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value; three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base; four, we are diversifying that customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise; and five, we are complementing our systems strategy with the software business centered on the one Junos platform. 
Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continued caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles.
The trends of mobile Internet and cloud have created the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. 
With that, I'll hand off to Stefan."

As we articulat",962,"Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I have the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experiences of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and our ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions.
We have aligned organizational structure to a new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platforms Systems Division and the Software Solutions Division, which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions to the customer lens, segmented by network domain.
We are an innovation-driven company, which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we have brought to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX were all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments.
We now have the strongest and most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we are taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core.
Several customers have embraced our vision of the Converged Supercore, and we are seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based, Telstra; and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers, such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product.
We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch, fabric upgrades we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for our 100-gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter.
With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100-gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100-gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper and combined with the ACX product line for access and navigation, which we will ship later this year, we see continued growth, opportunities across wireless and wireline applications.
Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric. 
Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive into the enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next-generation data center networks to one layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtual data center and emerging clouds.
We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response to this technology since we introduced it last year. We now have over 150 customers for the QFX product line, and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments. 
We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include Qihoo 360 in China and Australia-based Oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric win in Europe at Jan Yperman hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall is good, and we are encouraged with the pipeline we are building.
So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center and campus, and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction. 
One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products. 
Our Trio chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset, optimized for high-capacity transport, is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D program, delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation.
I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. 
Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda. 
I will now turn the call over to Robyn."
30439,184128950,287960,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our n",1414,"Thank you, Stefan, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our new products, reflected in orders for PTX, T4000 and QFabric. While we are still in the early phases of these new product cycles, customer feedback on our disruptive innovation is highly encouraging.
We saw a sequential increase in Service Provider revenue, driven primarily by large U.S. customers. As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing. 
While we believe the long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near term.
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks.
For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down of an equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margin.
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA, 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. service providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers. 
EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. This sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in Southern and parts of Central Europe. 
APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems Division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers. 
Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX4500 and EX2200, as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution. 
Software Solutions Division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployment. 
Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the feature offering of our Enterprise security customers. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing. 
Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 in Federal and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security.
For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue.
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix, as well as inventory-related costs. 
Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the reset of variable compensation and an increase in spare parts related to the new product introductions. 
While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent, to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvements through our supply chain. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses.
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objectives. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins. 
Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization.
For PSD, the contribution margin was 37%; and for SSD, contribution margin was 39%. The sequential decline for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter is mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the assets of BitGravity. 
Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semiannual bond interest payment.
DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year. 
CapEx and depreciation was consistent with prior quarters. 
We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock program.
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near and long term. 
Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter. 
As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovation. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business. 
I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observed, one is that with our large U.S. tier-1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that there's -- it's reverting back to a more seasonal pattern than we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one that we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new products in market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural design win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus. But overall, I'd say it's still a bit of a mixed bag and it's too early to call."

Certainly, we're at an interesting point in the evolution of the company, and that we've just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example, and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in on those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense envelope that's higher as a percentage of revenue than we would like long term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly, the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly, it's up to us to really drive execution in market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders."

So in terms of the headline gross margin number at 62.6%, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter, but it was mainly the result. In fact, primarily the result of the services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in spare parts costs because we are bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from an overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we're also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well."

Stefan, we missed you last week at the Open Networking Summit, so I just wanted to ask you some questions around that. In particular, how would you see QFabric now fitting in within the trends toward software-defined networking? And also it seems like some key customers like Google and Verizon are now embracing software-defined networking-type technologies as opposed to QFabric, and some of the customer wins you've pointed to seemed to be somewhat smaller types of enterprises or hospitals and things like that. So where do you see demand at this point shaping up for QFabric? And then just lastly, on that topic, of the 150 customers you talked about, roughly what percent are deploying the full fabric versus the top-of-rack solution?"

Michael Beesly, our CTO, presented together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of  SDN type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about SDN, I see a lot of goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences and unleashing innovation on top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK, to supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BD [ph], BTE or PCE. We are -- continue to focus on the programmability as one of the key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say, ""Okay, what's the use of that technology in the data center?"" One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure the network but also drives performance in the network. So a flat, anything in connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN-type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric, whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently Qihoo 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy, and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customers, so we have a mix of deployments for the customers who have adopted the QFX product line. They range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason they adopt the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they want to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as they adopt the key pieces of technology and there's a good number of them that actually adopt the full fabric, and as I mentioned, the first 2 in live deployment as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there, and just continue to focus on execution with the customer engagement."

Or is it only 20 or 30%, and that's much more to go if you have the interconnect?

Certainly with the distributive nature of top-of-racks, you made a good step forward in adopting the full system, if you have deployed the top-of-racks, and it will make it significantly simpler.

And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and the software, put together with an architectural approach. And now that we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D. And so the operating principle that states growing and expanding the operating margin from Q1, combined with the operating principle of that growing faster than the market, would be sort of the guiding principle. So, Robyn, anything else you want to add."

Then on other service providers, it's on a case-by-case basis. It sort of depends on where they are in the project cycle and how they prioritize things. In some cases, as they're growing their mobile Internet business, they may have one set of priorities and then shift to other priorities. So there's not a common pattern that you see across all of them. But the one thing that is common is certainly they built their business around delivering value to their customers in the form of networks, and those networks are transitioning to IP packet-switched network, which creates opportunity for us. So that is the one commonality that I see in Service Providers. But there's not some common pattern -- your question was kind of month-to-month.

Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System.
Before Kevin gets started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platforms Systems Division, which will often be referred to as PSD, and Software Solutions Division, or SSD. 
Our press release provides a description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in Appendix 2, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security.
The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products, such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and J-Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment.
The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products, such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. Detailed information including 2011 and 2010 announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the Appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses.
Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply-chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. 
GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. 
Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions]

Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we're seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan Dyckerhoff, who heads our Platforms Systems Division, to provide some further depth from the progress we are making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review.
First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA, as expected. But we saw good wins and activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings.
In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update of the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment.
Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue. 
The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, such as the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core and the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost per bit of traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business.
Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority of the drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solution.
The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments.
Within security, we continue to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are a result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities.
Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions we are delivering, and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing supports that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements. 
One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing; two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value; three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base; four, we are diversifying that customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise; and five, we are complementing our systems strategy with the software business centered on the one Junos platform. 
Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continued caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles.
Trends of mobile Internet and cloud have created the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. 
With that, I'll hand off to Stefan."

In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulate",962,"Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experiences of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and our ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions.
We have aligned organizational structure to our new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platforms Systems Division and the Software Solutions Divisions, which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions through the customer lens, segmented by network domain.
We are an innovation-driven company, which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we have brought to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX were all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments.
We now have the strongest and most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we are taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core.
Several customers have embraced our vision of the Converged Supercore, and we are seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based, Telstra; and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers, such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product.
We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch fabric upgrades, we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for our 100-gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter.
With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100-gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100-gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper and combined with the ACX product line for access and navigation, which we will ship later this year, we see continued growth, opportunities across wireless and wireline applications.
Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric. 
Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive into the enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next-generation data center networks to one layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtual data center and emerging clouds.
We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response to this technology since we introduced it last year. We now have over 150 customers for the QFX product line, and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments. 
We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include Qihoo 360 in China and Australia-based Oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric win in Europe at Jan Yperman hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall is good, and we are encouraged with the pipeline we are building.
So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center and campus, and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction. 
One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products. 
Our Trio chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset, optimized for high-capacity transport, is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D program, delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation.
I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. 
Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda. 
I will now turn the call over to Robyn."

As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing. 
While we believe the long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near-term.
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks.
For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down of an equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margins.
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA, 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas' revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. service providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers. 
EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. This sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in Southern and parts of Central Europe. 
APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems Division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers. 
Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX4500 and EX2200, as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution. 
Software Solutions Division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployments. 
Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the feature offering of our Enterprise security customers. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing. 
Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 in Federal and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security.
For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue.
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix, as well as inventory-related costs. 
Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the reset of variable compensation and an increase in spare parts related to the new product introductions. 
While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent, to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvements through our supply chain. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses.
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objectives. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins. 
Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization.
For PSD, the contribution margin was 37%; and for SSD, contribution margin was 39%. The sequential decline for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter is mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the assets of BitGravity. 
Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semi-annual bond interest payment.
DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year. 
CapEx and depreciation were consistent with prior quarters. 
We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock programs.
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near and long term. 
Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter. 
As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovations. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business. 
I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observe, one is that with our large U.S. tier-1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that there's -- it's reverting back to a more seasonal pattern, that we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one that we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new products in market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural designing win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus. But overall, I'd say it's still a bit of a mixed bag and it's too early to call."

Certainly, we're at an interesting point in the evolution of the company, in that, we've just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example, and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in on those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense envelope that's higher as a percentage of revenue than we would like long term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly, the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly, it's up to us to really drive execution in market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders."

So in terms of the headline gross margin number at 62.6%, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter, but it was mainly the result, in fact, primarily the result of the services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in spare parts costs because we are bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from an overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we're also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well."

Stefan, we missed you last week at the Open Networking Summit, so I just wanted to ask you some questions around that. In particular, how do you see QFabric now fitting in within the trend toward software-defined networking? And also it seems like some key customers like Google and Verizon are now embracing software-defined networking-type technologies as opposed to QFabric, and some of the customer wins you've pointed to seemed to be somewhat smaller types of enterprises or hospitals and things like that. So where do you see demand at this point shaping up for QFabric? And then just lastly, on that topic, of the 150 customers you talked about, roughly what percent are deploying the full fabric versus the top-of-rack solution?"

Michael Beesly, our CTO, presented together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of SDN type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about SDN, I see a lot of the goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences and unleashing innovation on top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK, through supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BD [ph], BTE or PCE. We are going to continue to focus on the programmability as one of the key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say, ""Okay, what's the use of that technology in the data center?"" One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure the network but also drives performance in the network. So a flat, anything in connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN-type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric, whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently Qihoo 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy, and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customers, so we have a mix of deployments for the customers who have adopted the QFX product line. They range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason they adopt the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they want to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as they adopt the key pieces of technology and there's a good number of them that actually adopt the full fabric, and as I mentioned, the first 2 in live deployment as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there, and just continue to focus on execution with the customer engagements."

Or is it only 20 or 30%, and that's much more to go if you have the interconnect?

Certainly with the distributive nature of top-of-racks, you made a good step forward in adopting the full system, if you have deployed the top-of-racks, and it will make it significantly simpler.

So in terms of APAC, what I talked about in my prepared remarks, and then maybe Kevin would like to comment as well, was that we did see year-over-year declines. The primary reason for that is Q1 of last year, which was pre-tsunami, if you remember tsunami was 03/11. We actually had completed in the first quarter a large service provider deployment in Japan. We talked about that at the time. And so our year-over-year comparisons were very high for Q1 of last year, and so that was the year-over-year decline story in Japan. We did see a sequential increase in Service Provider demand in Japan, which we were pleased about."

So with our newest release of Junos, we support the T4K, the MX upgrade, as well as the PTX.

And then from there our customers, we'll move to deployment. On the T4000, had a slightly higher revenue contribution in the quarter, and we would expect the qualification times to be in the 6- to 9-month range with that type of upgrade. And again, customers will deploy the capital prudently as they move through the year once they have the system qualified. And then last but not least on the MX, we saw good uptake on the MX upgrades in the quarter as we enable those with our new release of Junos, and we're optimistic about the traction of those upgrades as we move through the year."

However, as Kevin mentioned, we think service are going -- service providers are going to continue to be cautious with their CapEx, and that applies to all areas of the business. So I think it's a little bit too early to call the market growth for the rest of the year. Certainly as we work with our Service Provider customers, and we see their plans for deployment of capital towards the markets we address, I think we're in a very good position. But the overall environment for our Service Provider CapEx is something that will remain somewhat uncertain throughout the rest of the year as we stated."

Nikos, I'll take your second question and refer back to the operating principles that we've stated for 2012, and I think -- your first question on what will addressable market do in growth, is a relevant question, because one of the operating principles we have is we got to drive to grow faster than the market. And so when markets expand faster, that gives us more opportunity to grow and when they expand slower. We do think we're in a growth market, but frankly the focus is going to be as the operating principle states, which is growing faster than the market. And then the second part of your question is the way to drive operating leverage on the op margin is to drive the top line revenue by monetizing this great set of new products that we've just released in the marketplace. And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and the software, put together with an architectural approach. And now that we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D. And so the operating principle that states growing and expanding the operating margin from Q1, combined with the operating principle about growing faster than the market, would be sort of the guiding principle. So, Robyn, anything else you want to add."

Then on other service providers, it's on a case-by-case basis. It sort of depends on where they are in the project cycle and how they prioritize things. In some cases, as they're growing their mobile Internet business, they may have one set of priorities and then shift to other priorities. So there's not a common pattern that you see across all of them. But the one thing that is common is certainly they've built their business around delivering value to their customers in the form of networks, and those networks are transitioning to IP packet-switched network, which creates opportunity for us. So that is the one commonality that I see in Service Providers. But there's not some common pattern -- your question was kind of month-to-month.

Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System.
Before Kevin gets started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platforms Systems Division, which will often be referred to as PSD, and Software Solutions Division, or SSD.
Our press release provides a description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in Appendix 2, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security.
The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products, such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and J-Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment.
The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products, such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. Detailed information including 2011 and 2010 announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the Appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses.
Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply-chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier.
GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.
Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions]

Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we're seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan Dyckerhoff, who heads our Platforms Systems Division, to provide some further depth from the progress we are making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review.
First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA, as expected. But we saw good wins and activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings.
In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update of the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment.
Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue.
The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, such as the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core and the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost per bit of traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business.
Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority of the drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solution.
The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments.
Within security, we continue to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are a result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities.
Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions we are delivering, and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing supports that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements.
One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing; two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value; three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base; four, we are diversifying that customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise; and five, we are complementing our systems strategy with the software business centered on the one Junos platform.
Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continued caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles.
Trends of mobile Internet and cloud have created the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us.
With that, I'll hand off to Stefan."

It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulate",962,"Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experiences of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and our ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions.
We have aligned organizational structure to our new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platforms Systems Division and the Software Solutions Divisions, which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions through the customer lens, segmented by network domain.
We are an innovation-driven company, which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we have brought to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX were all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments.
We now have the strongest and most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we are taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core.
Several customers have embraced our vision of the Converged Supercore, and we are seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based, Telstra; and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers, such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product.
We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch fabric upgrades, we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for our 100-gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter.
With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100-gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100-gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper and combined with the ACX product line for access and navigation, which we will ship later this year, we see continued growth, opportunities across wireless and wireline applications.
Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric.
Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive into the enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next-generation data center networks to one layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtual data center and emerging clouds.
We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response to this technology since we introduced it last year. We now have over 150 customers for the QFX product line, and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments.
We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include Qihoo 360 in China and Australia-based Oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric win in Europe at Jan Yperman hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall is good, and we are encouraged with the pipeline we are building.
So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center and campus, and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction.
One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products.
Our Trio chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset, optimized for high-capacity transport, is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D program, delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation.
I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process.
Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda.
I will now turn the call over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges.

Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our new products, reflected in orders for PTX, T4000 and QFabric. While we are still in the early phases of these new product cycles, customer feedback on our disruptive innovation is highly encouraging.
We saw a sequential increase in Service Provider revenue, driven primarily by large U.S. customers. As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing.
While we believe the long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near-term.
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks.
For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down of an equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margins.
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA, 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas' revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. service providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers.
EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. This sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in Southern and parts of Central Europe.
APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems Division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers.
Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX4500 and EX2200, as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution.
Software Solutions Division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployments.
Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the feature offering of our Enterprise security customers.
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing.
Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 in Federal and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security.
For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue.
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix, as well as inventory-related costs.
Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the reset of variable compensation and an increase in spare parts related to the new product introductions.
While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent, to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvements through our supply chain.
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses.
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objectives.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins.
Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization.
For PSD, the contribution margin was 37%; and for SSD, contribution margin was 39%. The sequential decline for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.
The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter is mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the assets of BitGravity.
Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semi-annual bond interest payment.
DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year.
CapEx and depreciation were consistent with prior quarters.
We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock programs.
Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near and long term.
Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter.
As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovations. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business.
I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network.
And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions."

Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observe, one is that with our large U.S. tier-1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that there's -- it's reverting back to a more seasonal pattern that we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one that we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new products in market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural designing win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus.

Certainly, we're at an interesting point in the evolution of the company, in that, we've just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example, and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in on those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense envelope that's higher as a percentage of revenue than we would like long term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly, the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly, it's up to us to really drive execution in market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders."

So in terms of the headline gross margin number at 62.6%, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter, but it was mainly the result, in fact, primarily the result of the services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in spare parts costs because we are bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from an overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we're also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well."

Michael Beesly, our CTO, presented together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of SDN type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about SDN, I see a lot of the goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences and unleashing innovation on top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK, through supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BD [ph], BTE or PCE. We are going to continue to focus on the programmability as one of the key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say, ""Okay, what's the use of that technology in the data center?"" One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure the network but also drives performance in the network. So a flat, anything in connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN-type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric, whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently Qihoo 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy, and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customers, so we have a mix of deployments for the customers who have adopted the QFX product line. They range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason they adopt the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they want to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as they adopt the key pieces of technology and there's a good number of them that actually adopt the full fabric, and as I mentioned, the first 2 in live deployment as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there, and just continue to focus on execution with the customer engagements."

Certainly with the distributive nature of top-of-racks, you made a good step forward in adopting the full system, if you have deployed the top-of-racks, and it will make it significantly simpler. And as their businesses dictate that additional performance of a data center, they're going to go do that.

We've got some further releases coming throughout the year. We've been very open with our customers. And so the focus that we have in many ways on our security agenda is to really address the opportunity to improve the user interface and user experience for enterprise customers as they configure and manage these security devices, and we're seeing good response thus far in the quarter from the work that we've done, and we've got a good road map, and I think at the Financial Analyst Meeting, we'll provide a deeper dive on the overall end-to-end security strategy."

And then circling back to that comment on revenue proportions and so on, the T4000, I'm just curious if you could give us any kind of idea whether that -- would that be the majority of routing revenue as you exit the quarter -- or core routing revenue that is, as you exit the year I mean?

So in terms of APAC, what I talked about in my prepared remarks, and then maybe Kevin would like to comment as well, was that we did see year-over-year declines. The primary reason for that is Q1 of last year, which was pre-tsunami, if you remember tsunami was 03/11. We actually had completed in the first quarter a large service provider deployment in Japan. We talked about that at the time. And so our year-over-year comparisons were very high for Q1 of last year, and so that was the year-over-year decline story in Japan. We did see a sequential increase in Service Provider demand in Japan, which we were pleased about."

On the T4000, had a slightly higher revenue contribution in the quarter, and we would expect the qualification times to be in the 6- to 9-month range with that type of upgrade. And again, customers will deploy the capital prudently as they move through the year once they have the system qualified. And then last but not least on the MX, we saw good uptake on the MX upgrades in the quarter as we enable those with our new release of Junos, and we're optimistic about the traction of those upgrades as we move through the year."

However, as Kevin mentioned, we think service are going -- service providers are going to continue to be cautious with their CapEx, and that applies to all areas of the business. So I think it's a little bit too early to call the market growth for the rest of the year. Certainly as we work with our Service Provider customers, and we see their plans for deployment of capital towards the markets we address, I think we're in a very good position. But the overall environment for our Service Provider CapEx is something that will remain somewhat uncertain throughout the rest of the year as we stated."

Nikos, I'll take your second question and refer back to the operating principles that we've stated for 2012, and I think -- your first question on what will addressable market do in growth, is a relevant question, because one of the operating principles we have is we got to drive to grow faster than the market. And so when markets expand faster, that gives us more opportunity to grow and when they expand slower. We do think we're in a growth market, but frankly the focus is going to be as the operating principle states, which is growing faster than the market. And then the second part of your question is the way to drive operating leverage on the op margin is to drive the top line revenue by monetizing this great set of new products that we've just released in the marketplace. And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and the software, put together with an architectural approach. And now that we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D. And so the operating principle that states growing and expanding the operating margin from Q1, combined with the operating principle about growing faster than the market, would be sort of the guiding principle.

Look, in the Service Provider marketplace, the observation that I would have is there's -- certainly in Europe, there's a geographic commonality that's sort of impacted by the macro situation in Europe that creates a certain pattern of cautiousness on those service providers. Then on other service providers, it's on a case-by-case basis. It sort of depends on where they are in the project cycle and how they prioritize things. In some cases, as they're growing their mobile Internet business, they may have one set of priorities and then shift to other priorities. So there's not a common pattern that you see across all of them. But the one thing that is common is certainly they've built their business around delivering value to their customers in the form of networks, and those networks are transitioning to IP packet-switched network, which creates opportunity for us. So that is the one commonality that I see in Service Providers. But there's not some common pattern -- your question was kind of month-to-month.

In general non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. 
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin."

All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We're also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we didn't execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion. 
I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment, how we're executing against that. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we're seeing in the market, including with our new products and I've asked Bob Muglia who heads our Software Solutions division to join the call to talk about development in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your questions. 
Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets, because we bring the portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3 different areas we believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ASX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well-positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amount of mobile traffic. 
As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data point suggests that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result of the overall U.S. markets continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets. 
On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio along with QFabric, grow strong performing Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. datacenters. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics first ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mix outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S. 
In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for 4 customers where scale matters both service providers and large Enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment. 
Looking out over the second half of the year. We are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to have met some of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress particularly with our routing and datacenter offering. We set our revenue targets for new innovation the analyst meeting, and we are very focused on them. Second, we are aligning our resources with a focus on the right projects and activity that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effective as we are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the analyst meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more. 
We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly. 
So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 , but it remains challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching and we are on a defined path to straighten our products and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. 
To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business, with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind. Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?"

It's good to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their networks",1063,"Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's good to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their networks and how we're pushing the marketplace from both the R&D and Go to Market perspectives. Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions systems and software. 
Within the software division at Juniper, our philosophy is software complements our systems, so our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major component of the network whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains or 2 3 7 enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of network and technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges. 
With that as a backdrop, like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategies and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw a good high-end SRX sales to SPs largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefits of the SRX provides solutions. We have recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security but in Q2, we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while. 
As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments of the campus and branch level. In the short-term, we are focused on management and the as secure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution. 
We are also building on our success in network security to delivering next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Thus, enabling securing intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience. Our focus on network management starts with security design, which we talked about at This is an application posted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production in the Tier 1 Service Provider. We collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response. 
We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing security design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of security design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013. Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 Application Delivery Controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling datacenter applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time. 
The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long-term. The Juniper products that we will build using the Application Delivery Controller technology will ship for some time. Yet it's clear with the abolition of the new network that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined. In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strength, both organically and via acquisition key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have that in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it's changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength in the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the security design, we're well-positioned in both focused on executing our plan. Thanks for your time and I turn it now over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking is solid, yet the near term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric. 
Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC. 
In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenues from the recently announced deployment of PTX. 
For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes the $0.02 gain from equity investment. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up 3% sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margins. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA was 28% and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of Federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw a higher revenues from cable, content and some wireless and wire line customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider. 
EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment. 
APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX. 
Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of lower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive in Service Provider revenue for this product. 
In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and Internet routing. 
Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas. 
For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. 
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the third quarter. Favorable routing mix was offset by a highest mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was the result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in SaaS and service with the goal of driving revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses. 
Looking at segment contribution margins. PSD contribution margin was 14.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margin. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenue, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partly offset by reduced operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credit. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investment. Cash from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of over the prior 2 quarters. 
Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise market globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near-term. Obviously we will calibrate our buybacks in quarters with market conditions at the time, but based on current trends, we recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, action that are current underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 level, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013. 
In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network. And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

We already have today a number of products that have many attributes of SDN, and I'll first point out that when the industry does about SDN, there's a great deal of similarity to the programmable network, which we've been talking about for several years.

And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDKs is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. Specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable open flow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013.

You can see with the DSO that we had that it was a relatively linear quarter. So nothing unusual to comment there. In terms of the cost reductions, let me step by saying where -- our strategy is around driving revenue growth. We talked about that at the Analyst Day. We're very focused on doing that. We're also focused on driving operational expectation across the board, whether it is to drive the revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue. And I outlined at FAM, we had targeted at 39% to 42% of revenue as our operating ex over the next 3 years. So what I announced today is that we'd now talked about, we had identified opportunities in that range now. We have identified those cost savings and we're in the process of implementing those as we speak. So we will talk more about those to share the amounts in the P&L. But we are very focused on delivering both, both revenue growth and operating expense."

I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned we saw growth in both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year end we see customer adoption. We do feel that go into 2013, our security business will be very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effect management team in place, which is well established now and has -- is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them so I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and had with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with rad we're is 1 where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide. And then we work together to deliver a solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually are benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to grow on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of R&D investment, will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That will be putting our own investment and in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, and will be based on that technology. But as I mentioned that is still some time away so what ever market."

All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We are also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take you through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we intend to execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion. 
I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment and how we are executing against them. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we are seeing in the market, including with our new products, and I've asked Bob Muglia, who heads our Software Solutions division, to join the call to talk about developments in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your question. 
Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets because we bring a portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3 different areas we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers as they drive efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ACX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amounts of mobile traffic. 
As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data point suggests that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result, the overall U.S. markets continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets. 
On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio, along with QFabric, drove strong performance in the Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries, has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. data centers. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics for its ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mixed outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S. 
In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for customers where scale matters, both at service providers and large enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment. 
Looking out over the second half of the year, we are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to drive momentum of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress, particularly with our routing and data center offerings. We set our revenue targets for new innovations at the Analyst Meeting, and we are very focused on them. Second, we are aligning our resources with focus on the right projects and activities that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effectiveness. We are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the Analyst Meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more. 
We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly. 
So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 that has remained challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching, and we are on a defined path to strengthen our product set and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind. 
Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?"
30439,213709137,329840,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' vie",1073,"Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their network and how we're approaching the marketplace from both the R&D and go-to-market perspectives. 
Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions: Systems and Software. Within the Software Division at Juniper, our philosophy is that software complements our systems. So our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major components of the network, whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach, 2 customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains, or 2-3-7, enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of networking technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges. 
With that as a backdrop, what I'd like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategy and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw good high-end SRX sales to SPs based largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefit the SRX provides to the solution. We recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security, but in Q2 we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while. 
As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments at the campus and branch level. In the short term, we are focused on management and the AppSecure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution. 
We are also building on our success in network security to delivering next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Mykonos, thus enabling security intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience.
Our focus on network management starts with Security Design, which we talked about at FAM. This is an application hosted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, PoP firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We've had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production within a Tier 1 service provider. We've collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response. 
We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing Security Design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of Security Design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013. 
Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 application delivery controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling data center applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time. 
The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long term. The Juniper products that we will build using the application delivery controller technology won't ship for some time. Yet it's clear, with the evolution of the new network, that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined. 
In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strength, both organically and via acquisitions of key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have had in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it is changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength in the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the Security Design, we're well positioned and focused on executing our plan.
Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it now over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking are solid, yet the near-term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric. 
Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC. 
In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenue from their recently announced deployment of PTX. 
For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes a $0.02 gain from equity investment. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up 3% sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margin. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA, 28%; and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw higher revenue from cable, content and some wireless and wireline customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider. 
EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment. 
APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 16% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX. 
Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of slower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive fluctuations in Service Provider revenues for this product. 
In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and Internet phones. 
Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas. 
For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. 
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the first. A favorable routing mix was offset by a higher switching mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was the result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in sales and service with the goal of driving revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses. 
Looking at segment contribution margins, PSD contribution margin was 40.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margins. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenue, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credit. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of -- over the prior 2 quarters. 
Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect the customers to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise markets globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near term. Obviously, we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. But based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, actions are currently underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 level, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013. 
In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network.
And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

When you're talking about wireless and a lot of opportunities you're getting in wireless, you didn't mention MobileNext so I was wondering if that was kind of a -- just a slip-off or intentionally that wasn't really maybe the emphasis on MobileNext. So that was just kind of a clarification. Robyn, you're talking about the gross margin mix, and you said that routing was a positive driver of gross margin, but then was offset by a negative gross margin mix in switching. I'm wondering, is that negative gross margin based on switching mix? In switching, it's hard to say due to the entry of QFabric into the switching mix. And if so, can you give us a sense as to how large QFabric was and what you expect that to be in the next quarter and going forward and give us a sense as to how that grows? And if it doesn't, that gross margin went down?"

The long-term demand fundamentals of growth in network traffic continue. There's more devices, there's more video, there's more users, there's more data centers, there's just more traffic. So as traffic continues to grow and if there's a slowdown or pause in some of the capital expenditures for routing in the service provider sector, certainly that implies that customers are running their network hotter, and that will be consistent with our view and our engagement with customers. Question will be at what point do they either hit the point where they're running so hot that they need to make the investments, or at what point do the economic conditions for those customers hit the situation where they start to do upgrades and build more capacity in their networks? But the important point, I think, is the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact. Traffic continues to grow, and every customer situation is different. In certain cases, it may be a function of their revenue. In some cases, it's a function of their balance sheet. In some cases, they're being cautious given the economic situation and the country that they reside. But what we're doing is we're being very focused and very connected on -- with those customers to ensure that we're working proactively with them so that when they do start to spend and upgrade and launch new projects, that Juniper is there with a great value proposition and prepared to help them do that."

We already have today a number of products that have many attributes of SDN, and I'll first point out that when the industry talks about SDN, there's a great deal of similarity to the programmable network, which we've been talking about for several years. SDN is really all about how applications in the infrastructure that support them can drive the network and get the network to do what it wants. And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDK is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. In specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable of OpenFlow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013. So you're seeing -- what I would say is we have products today, and we're going to continue to enhance and expand those products, and we'll work very closely across the industry, including with partners like VMware, to ensure that Juniper Networks, the platforms and the software that we provide is the best complement to the software that they deliver."

And so we continue to see very good uptake of customers running QFabric nodes, and certainly, we're seeing a growing number of those customers also now purchase and either go through certification or deployment of the full QFabric systems. We announced the -- a new interconnect system called the QFX3000-M and this is important in a relevant point because it is a fixed interconnect that provides QFabric for up to 16 nodes. And so it provides a lower entry point for those customers who have purchased and deployed nodes who now want to try the full QFabric system. They can deploy the QFX3000-M, and it lowers the entry point and provides them flexibility in terms of how they want to deploy that in the fixed interconnect nodes.

We're also focused on driving operational execution across the board, whether it is to drive that revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue.

The first one with regards to security, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter overall decline. I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat the cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned, we saw growth, both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames for when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year and we see customer adoption. We do feel that going into 2013, our security business will be seeing very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effectively an entirely new management team in place, which is well established now and has -- and is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them. So I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and where we're heading with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with Radware is one where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide and then we work together to deliver our solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually in our benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to grow on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of our R&D investment, it will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That's where we'll be putting our own investment. And in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, it will be based on that technology.

Please remember, when listening to today's call, that statement concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. 
All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. 
In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP to non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. 
In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. 
On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate.

All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We are also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take you through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we intend to execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion. 
I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment and how we are executing against them. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we are seeing in the market, including with our new products, and I've asked Bob Muglia, who heads our Software Solutions division, to join the call to talk about developments in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your questions. 
Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets because we bring a portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3-4 areas we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers as they drive efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ACX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amounts of mobile traffic. 
As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data points suggest that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result, the overall U.S. markets should continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets. 
On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio, along with QFabric, drove strong performance in the Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries, has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. data centers. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics for its ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mixed outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S. 
In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for customers where scale matters, both at service providers and large enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment. 
Looking out over the second half of the year, we are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to drive momentum of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress, particularly with our routing and data center offerings. We set our revenue targets for new innovations at the Analyst Meeting, and we are very focused on those. Second, we are aligning our resources with focus on the right projects and activities that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effectiveness. We are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the Analyst Meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more. 
We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly. 
So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 that has remained challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching, and we are on a defined path to strengthen our product set and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind. 
Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?"

It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' vie",1074,"Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their network and how we're approaching the marketplace from both the R&D and go-to-market perspectives. 
Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions: Systems and Software. Within the Software Division at Juniper, our philosophy is that software complements our systems. So our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major components of the network, whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach, 2 customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains, or 2-3-7, enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of networking technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges. 
With that as a backdrop, what I'd like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategy and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw good high-end SRX sales to SPs based largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefit the SRX provides to the solution. We recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security, but in Q2 we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while. 
As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments at the campus and branch level. In the short term, we are focused on management and the AppSecure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution. 
We are also building on our success in network security to deliver a next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Mykonos, thus enabling security intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience.
Our focus on network management starts with Security Design, which we talked about at FAM. This is an application hosted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, PoP firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We've had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production within a Tier 1 service provider. We've collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response. 
We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing Security Design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of Security Design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013. 
Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 application delivery controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling data center applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time. 
The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long term. The Juniper products that we will build using the application delivery controller technology won't ship for some time. Yet it's clear, with the evolution of the new network, that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined. 
In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strengths, both organically and via acquisitions of key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have had in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it is changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength of the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the Security Design, we're well positioned and focused on executing our plan.
Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it now over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking are solid, yet the near-term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric. 
Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC. 
In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenue from their recently announced deployment of PTX. 
For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes a $0.02 gain from equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margin. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA, 28%; and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw higher revenue from cable, content and some wireless and wireline customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider. 
EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment. 
APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 16% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX. 
Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of slower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive fluctuations in Service Provider revenues for this product. 
In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and internet phones. 
Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas. 
For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. 
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the first quarter. A favorable routing mix was offset by a higher switching mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was a result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in sales and service with the goal of driving revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses. 
Looking at segment contribution margins, PSD contribution margin was 40.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margins. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenues, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credits. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of -- over the prior 2 quarters. 
Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect customers to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise markets globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credits. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near term. Obviously, we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. But based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, actions are currently underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 levels, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013. 
In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network.
And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

So that was just kind of a clarification. Robyn, you're talking about the gross margin mix, and you said that routing was a positive driver of gross margin, but then was offset by a negative gross margin mix in switching. I'm wondering, is that negative gross margin based on switching mix? In switching, it's hard to say, due to the entry of QFabric into the switching mix. And if so, can you give us a sense as to how large QFabric was and what you expect that to be in the next quarter and going forward and give us a sense as to how that grows?

We think second half spending by the Tier 1 service providers in the U.S. will be higher than first half. If you just look at their guided CapEx, something like 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half is what you look at. But if you just take the Tier 1 service providers, they only represent about 25% of the total CapEx globally, and I think the uptick in U.S., I think, is offset by the weakness that we see in Europe and other parts of Asia-Pacific.

The long-term demand fundamentals of growth in network traffic continue. There's more devices, there's more video, there's more users, there's more data centers, there's just more traffic. So as traffic continues to grow and if there's a slowdown or pause in some of the capital expenditures for routing in the service provider sector, certainly that implies that customers are running their network hotter, and that will be consistent with our view and our engagement with customers. The question will be at what point do they either hit the point where they're running so hot that they need to make the investments, or at what point do the economic conditions for those customers hit the situation where they start to do upgrades and build more capacity in their networks? But the important point, I think, is the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact. Traffic continues to grow, and every customer situation is different. In certain cases, it may be a function of their revenue. In some cases, it's a function of their balance sheet. In some cases, they're being cautious given the economic situation in the country that they reside.

SDN is really all about how applications in the infrastructure that support them can drive the network and get the network to do what it wants. And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDK is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. In specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable OpenFlow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013.

We announced the -- a new interconnect system called the QFX3000-M and this is important in a relevant point because it is a fixed interconnect that provides QFabric for up to 16 nodes. And so it provides a lower entry point for those customers who have purchased and deployed nodes who now want to try the full QFabric system.

We're also focused on driving operational execution across the board, whether it is to drive that revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue. And as I outlined at FAM, we are targeted at 39% to 42% of revenue as our OpEx over the next 3 years. So these -- what I've announced today is that we've now -- at FAM I talked about -- we had identified opportunities in that range, now we've identified those cost savings, and we're in the process of implementing those as we speak. So we will talk more about those as we start to show the amounts in the P&L. But we're very focused on delivering both, both revenue growth and operating expense efficiencies."

But I will say that today, as we sit here, we have a great deal of clarity across the 2 customer segments that we're targeting, the Service Provider and the Enterprise, the 3 businesses we're in, switching, security and routing, and then the 7 domains. And in particular, with the domains, it provides us a deep context of understanding of customers' business needs, and we see this technology as being critical to fulfill those needs, and that's why we've done the -- we've created the relationship that we have, and we think it's a good, sound financial decision, and we think it's a good business opportunity for us going forward."

The second question is clarification about what you said on ADC. I don't understand why you're going to have 2 different pieces of software, one from Radware, one from Riverbed, and invest in both and try to integrate and try to educate the salespeople on both, and how does it work with your desire to lower costs, so where is the rationale in keeping both?"

The first one with regards to security, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter overall decline. I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat the cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned, we saw growth, both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames for when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year and we see customer adoption. We do feel that going into 2013, our security business will be seeing very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effectively an entirely new management team in place, which is well established now and has -- and is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them. So I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and where we're heading with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with Radware is one where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide and then we work together to deliver our solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually in our benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to build on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of our R&D investment, it will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That's where we'll be putting our own investment. And in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, it will be based on that technology. But as I mentioned, that is still some time away, still a little while before we'll have the product to market."

All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We are also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take you through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we intend to execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion. 
I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment and how we are executing against them. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we are seeing in the market, including with our new products, and I've asked Bob Muglia, who heads our Software Solutions division, to join the call to talk about developments in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your questions. 
Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets because we bring a portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3 in the 4 areas we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers as they drive efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ACX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amounts of mobile traffic. 
As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data points suggest that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result, the overall U.S. markets should continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets. 
On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio, along with QFabric, drove strong performance in the Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries, has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. data centers. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics for its ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mixed outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S. 
In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for customers where scale matters, both at service providers and large enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment. 
Looking out over the second half of the year, we are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to drive momentum of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress, particularly with our routing and data center offerings. We set our revenue targets for new innovations at the Analyst Meeting, and we are very focused on those. Second, we are aligning our resources with focus on the right projects and activities that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effectiveness. We are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the Analyst Meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more. 
We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly. 
So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 that has remained challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching, and we are on a defined path to strengthen our product set and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind. 
Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?"
30439,213709137,331089,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' vie",1074,"Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their network and how we're approaching the marketplace from both the R&D and go-to-market perspectives. 
Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions: Systems and Software. Within the Software Division at Juniper, our philosophy is that software complements our systems. So our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major components of the network, whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach, 2 customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains, or 2-3-7, enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of networking technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges. 
With that as a backdrop, what I'd like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategy and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw good high-end SRX sales to SPs based largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefit the SRX provides to the solution. We recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security, but in Q2 we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while. 
As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments at the campus and branch level. In the short term, we are focused on management and the AppSecure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution. 
We are also building on our success in network security to deliver a next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Mykonos, thus enabling security intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience.
Our focus on network management starts with Security Design, which we talked about at FAM. This is an application hosted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, PoP firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We've had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production within a Tier 1 service provider. We've collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response. 
We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing Security Design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of Security Design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013. 
Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 application delivery controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling data center applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time. 
The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long term. The Juniper products that we will build using the application delivery controller technology won't ship for some time. Yet it's clear, with the evolution of the new network, that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined. 
In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strengths, both organically and via acquisitions of key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have had in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it is changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength of the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the Security Design, we're well positioned and focused on executing our plan.
Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it now over to Robyn."

Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking are solid, yet the near-term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric. 
Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC. 
In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenue from their recently announced deployment of PTX. 
For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes a $0.02 gain from equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margin. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA, 28%; and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw higher revenue from cable, content and some wireless and wireline customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider. 
EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment. 
APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand.
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 16% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX. 
Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of slower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive fluctuations in Service Provider revenues for this product. 
In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and internet phones. 
Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas. 
For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. 
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the first quarter. A favorable routing mix was offset by a higher switching mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was a result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in sales and service with the goal of driving revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses. 
Looking at segment contribution margins, PSD contribution margin was 40.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margins. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenues, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 
The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credits. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of -- over the prior 2 quarters. 
Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect customers to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise markets globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credits. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near term. Obviously, we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. But based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, actions are currently underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 levels, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013. 
In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network.
And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

When you're talking about wireless and a lot of opportunities you're getting in wireless, you didn't mention MobileNext so I was wondering if that was kind of a -- just a slip-up or intentionally that wasn't really maybe the emphasis on MobileNext. So that was just kind of a clarification. Robyn, you're talking about the gross margin mix, and you said that routing was a positive driver of gross margin, but then was offset by a negative gross margin mix in switching. I'm wondering, is that negative gross margin based on switching mix? In switching, it's hard to say, due to the entry of QFabric into the switching mix. And if so, can you give us a sense as to how large QFabric was and what you expect that to be in the next quarter and going forward and give us a sense as to how that grows? And if it doesn't, that gross margin [indiscernible]?"

The question will be at what point do they either hit the point where they're running so hot that they need to make the investments, or at what point do the economic conditions for those customers hit the situation where they start to do upgrades and build more capacity in their networks?

In certain cases, it may be a function of their revenue. In some cases, it's a function of their balance sheet. In some cases, they're being cautious given the economic situation in the country that they reside. But what we're doing is we're being very focused and very connected on -- with those customers to ensure that we're working proactively with them so that when they do start to spend and upgrade and launch new projects, that Juniper is there with a great value proposition and prepared to help them do that."

We already have today a number of products that have many attributes of SDN, and I'll first point out that when the industry talks about SDN, there's a great deal of similarity to the programmable network, which we've been talking about for several years. SDN is really all about how applications in the infrastructure that support them can drive the network and get the network to do what it wants. And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDK is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. In specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable OpenFlow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013. So you're seeing -- what I would say is we have products today, and we're going to continue to enhance and expand those products, and we'll work very closely across the industry, including with partners like VMware, to ensure that Juniper Networks, the platforms and the software that we provide is the best complement to the software that they deliver."

And so we continue to see very good uptake of customers running QFabric nodes, and certainly, we're seeing a growing number of those customers also now purchase and either go through certification or deployment of the full QFabric systems. We announced the -- a new interconnect system called the QFX3000-M and this is important in a relevant point because it is a fixed interconnect that provides QFabric for up to 16 nodes. And so it provides a lower entry point for those customers who have purchased and deployed nodes who now want to try the full QFabric system. They can deploy the QFX3000-M, and it lowers the entry point and provides them flexibility in terms of how they want to deploy that in a fixed interconnect node.

We're also focused on driving operational execution across the board, whether it is to drive that revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue. And as I outlined at FAM, we are targeted at 39% to 42% of revenue as our OpEx over the next 3 years. So these -- what I've announced today is that we've now -- at FAM I talked about -- we had identified opportunities in that range, now we've identified those cost savings, and we're in the process of implementing those as we speak.

The second question is clarification about what you said on ADC. I don't understand why you're going to have 2 different pieces of software, one from Radware, one from Riverbed, and invest in both and try to integrate and try to educate the salespeople on both, and how does it work with your desire to lower costs, so where is the rationale in keeping both?"

The first one with regards to security, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter overall decline. I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat the cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned, we saw growth, both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames for when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year and we see customer adoption. We do feel that going into 2013, our security business will be seeing very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effectively an entirely new management team in place, which is well established now and has -- and is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them. So I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and where we're heading with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with Radware is one where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide and then we work together to deliver our solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually in our benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to build on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of our R&D investment, it will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That's where we'll be putting our own investment. And in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, it will be based on that technology. But as I mentioned, that is still some time away, still a little while before we'll have the product to market."

All of our major financial metrics were in line or ahead of our guided ranges in what continues to be a challenging environment. We remain focused on those things that are within our control and on developing delivering great solutions for our customers. 
During the third quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives we outlined broadly in last quarter's conference call. We have streamlined our organization, consolidated functional overlap and clarified our priorities. These actions are designed to best align the company's resources with our strategic priorities. They will also allow us to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. We do this with a clear recognition that it is the culture of innovation within our company that enables our customers business success and creates value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll focus my comments today on how we are performing in the market, including our progress relative to our new products. I also want to address some of the questions I know many of you have on the increasing industry focus around network programmability and software-defined networks, referred to as SDN. These are areas where we are very active. Robyn will walk you through some of the specifics on our financials, and we will conclude with Q&A that will include Bob Muglia and Stefan Dyckerhoff. 
Our total revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We continue to see healthy performance in our Service Provider business, including improving demand by our largest U.S. customers and good results in the EMEA and APAC regiones. The Enterprise story is mixed, with good quarter-over-quarter growth driven by EMEA and APAC, but offset somewhat by softness in the Americas. Our Service Provider revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We continue to expect to see a more typical pattern of Service Provider spend within the industry, with second half investment levels higher than first. 
I'm pleased to note that the upgrade cycle relative to the T4000 core routers is underway and customer engagement around PTX is very strong. Our PTX product complements our T4000 core routers by collapsing multiple existing core networks into a single MPLS-based transport network, and we're seeing good customer feedback for both products. These innovations provide us competitive differentiation. With PTX in particular, we now have more than 15 customers, including recent strategic wins with companies like Optus in Australia and XO Communications here in the U.S. We believe we are off to a very promising start with PTX.
We had a good quarter in Edge routing, and we continue to build on the success of our flagship MX platform. Earlier this month, we announced the industry's most powerful Edge routing platform, the MX2020, to enable rapid service creation and service delivery. It's the only Edge platform capable of delivering broadband, mobile and business services on one platform. In addition, we announced a series of software offerings that include our service delivery gateway and the JunosV App Engine, that offers a broad set of solutions on the MX. 
Switching revenue was up solidly both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to take share with the EX with recent customer wins such as Suncore, the top 5 North American energy company. We also continued to win new customers with QFabric. Recent with include the University of Frankfurt and in the APAC region, BOCI, a leading cross-border platform provider for diversified financial services firms in China. BOCI is one of several customers deploying our QFabric M as its new data center core. 
We're making good progress in rebuilding momentum in security. We grew in low double digits on a percentage basis quarter-on-quarter. Demand for high end SRX within the Service Provider sector was also strong this quarter, growing quarter-on-quarter. But we also saw gains across most of our product families, lending to our confidence that our security business is beginning to stabilize. 
We're making good progress toward the objective we laid out at the analyst meeting to exit 2013 with an annualized run rate of $600 million in new product revenue. QFabric, PTX and T4000 each posted good revenue in the third quarter. The ACX Universal Access product family began shipping in Q3 and MX2020 will bring in shipping in Q4. MobileNext is now running production traffic with one of our nobility customers, and we continue to engage with additional customers on insertion opportunities with our mobile packet core solution.
As we talk about new products and innovation, I want to address network programmability and what we're doing around software-defined networks. We have a few key pillars that define our SDN strategy. First, we continue to believe that a software-driven network platform will ultimately deliver maximum business value for our customers. This is division behind of the network that we laid out 3 years ago and continue to deliver upon. Junos is a key pillar of this programmability strategy. Next, we believe that the focus of SDN is initially around data center switching. The data center is where SDN solutions can drive the most business value for customers. Today, we have a data center fabric solution in market with QFabric. It was architected with some common principles of SDN. For example, a QFabric Director at its essence is a software-driven controller for the QFabric system. So we have this foundation to build on as we continue to evolve QFabric in our entire data center portfolio. 
We know that lots of people are building SDN controllers. What that means for us is that we need to make sure our network systems work with as many of those controllers as possible. Open standards have always been a core underpinning of our innovation strategy. That means our systems need to support SDN protocols, including OpenFlow, and that's exactly what we're delivering. We initially demonstrated OpenFlow on the MX in 2011, and this year we extended that to the EX. We will have a productized version of OpenFlow 1.3 on the MX, EX and QFabric next year so that our data center solutions can interoperate with these many SDN controllers that are being built. 
We are actively engaging with several customers on the use cases where we think SDN can deliver the most value. We have a solution that is architected with SDN principles and QFabric, running in many customers' data centers today. We continue to gain traction with customers as we build out our feature sets. We are also building SDN APIs including OpenFlow into our systems. And as we do this throughout our product roadmap, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio. We think we're making pretty good progress. 
I'll wrap up my comments by reiterating that we executed well in the third quarter, and we took the necessary steps to restructure the company to sharpen our focus on the right priorities, enable agility and drive efficiencies across the company. The actions we are taking to align our resources with our strategic priorities are ahead of schedule and that further strengthens our position as we look to drive revenue growth in 2013. The macro environment probably isn't going to become anymore certain in the near term, but we continue to focus on our own execution as we manage through this in line with our operating principles.  We believe our traction is increasing across all 3 of our product areas, routing, switching and security, and that includes our new products as we move towards the expectation we set at our analyst meeting in June. 
Before I hand over to Robyn, I want to note that we also issued a press release today regarding our Platform Systems division. The fund backdrops within Juniper will be changing. After many successful years as an operating executive, Stefan has made the decision to pursue a career as a venture capitalists. At the same time, Stefan will remain actively engaged with Juniper. Beginning in January 2013, he will transition to a new role as a staff consultant, supporting me and the executive team. In this role, he will continue to work with the executive team on strategy and some key customer engagements. 
As Stefan shifts into his new role I'm pleased to note that Rami Rahim, a 15-year Juniper veteran and key architect of our routing portfolio, succeeds Stefan in the leadership role of PSD. Stefan will work closely with Rami to ensure a smooth transition. Stefan, would you like to add a few comments?"

My decision to change career path is driven by a long-standing personal aspiration to work with intrapreneurs as a venture capitalist with the goal of financing market companies. Juniper's product portfolio and our roadmaps are stronger than they have ever been, and we are starting to see the results of the work over the last years, with early signs of increased momentum on T4000, PTX, MX, ACX and QFX that will enable future growth for Juniper. 
I have worked with Rami for many years, and he has played a key role in Juniper's success to date. I'm confident that he is the right executive to lead the Platform Systems division, and I look forward to working with him, both during the transition phase and then throughout 2013 as an advisor. 
I want to add my personal thanks to the employees at Juniper for all of their support during my many years with the company, and look forward to staying connected with Juniper with my new role.

Juniper delivered third quarter revenue growth on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and we improved our operational performance. While many customers remain cautious in an uncertain near-term environment, we continue to see positive long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance working. 
We are focused on the things we can control so let me update you on our progress with our cost structure initiatives. Last quarter, we announced that efforts were underway to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model. The initiated multiple actions, including a reduction in our workforce of approximately 500 positions, supply chain and procurement activities, as well as several facility consolidations and other cost saving measures.  In the third quarter, these actions have resulted in pretax charges of $83 million, of course with primarily with workforce reduction, inventory, facility and other asset write-downs. 
We expect to have additional charges in the next several quarters primarily related to facilities and other asset write-downs. Our employees remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution, and I would like to thank them for their hard work and ongoing commitment during this turbulent time. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, the book-to-bill was greater than one, with product deferred revenue and product backlog increasing sequentially. Customer demand this quarter for T4000 and PTX reflected design wins with good adoption across all 3 geographies. 
Total revenue was $1,118,000,000, an increase of 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to growth in APAC and EMEA across both the Service Provider and Enterprise sectors. The year-over-year increase was due to U.S. Service Provider and International Enterprise growth. 
For the third quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. This reflected the impact of the charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.06 year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected our revenue growth and improved operational performance. 
Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to U.S. Enterprise. The year-over-year increase reflected Service Provider growth, particularly in large U.S. carriers. 
EMEA revenue was up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. This increase over the last quarter reflected improved Enterprise revenue and some new wins in Service Provider. While we did see revenue improvement this quarter, we still see a soft demand environment in the region.
APAC revenue was up 26% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year, with sequential increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. We see good growth across the region particularly in China. 
Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems Division revenue was $893 million, up 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, which was flat sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. And our new products continued to gain traction in the marketplace. We have seen good engagement in all 3 geographies on both T4000 and the PTX core products. 
Year-over-year, we saw good growth from the MX products and as anticipated, the older products of M&E were the main reason for the year-over-year decline in routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 2% sequentially to $514 million. Total switching product revenue increased 4% sequentially and 19% year-over-year to $146 million. We continue to take share with our portfolio of EX and QFabric switching products. 
SSD revenue in the quarter was $225 million, up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $178 million, up 12% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected gains across most product families. 
High end SRX product revenue increased 18% sequentially and was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting Service Provider deployment timing. And we expect continued revenue fluctuations for this product. Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, continues to make good progress with Enterprise customers and was up $0.07 sequentially and 2% year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $705 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential growth was due to improved performance with large Service Providers globally and content service providers. Enterprise revenue was $413 million, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new financial services and public sector account wins in EMEA and APAC. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue in the U.S. Schedule and Financial Services sector compared to strong third quarter of last year. 
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses, non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased to 65.6% compared to 63.4% last quarter. While the sequential increase reflected our continued supply chain efficiency improvement, approximately 100 basis points of the increase was due to items, which we do not expect to recur. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.8% versus 64.7% in the quarter. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.2%, up 2.8 points from the prior quarter, reflecting productivity improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially to $544 million due to the timing of additional prototype costs, annual employee merit awards and higher variable expenses. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,584 employees and this does not reflect the impact of our workforce reduction, which I discussed earlier.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. This sequential increase of 1.9 points was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, with operating expenses flat as a percent of revenue. The GAAP tax rate was 56.7% for the quarter. This is up sequentially due primarily to the effect of the restructuring and other associated charges. The non-GAAP tax rate was 34.4%. This is higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of income. And as a reminder, the tax rates reflect no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investment. Cash flow from operations was $173 million. DSO was a healthy 32 days in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, capital expenditures were down slightly and depreciation was up slightly. We continue to move ahead with our buildout of our campus. This enables consolidation. We repurchased 13.9 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $18. We have $818 million remaining on our current authorization, and we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. Based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to continue to do more. 
Now I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. 
At this point there is no evidence of any indication of the significant improvement in the spending environment over the next few quarters. We expect customers to remain cautious with their investment decision. We are pleased with the progress towards the new product revenue goal that we discussed at FAM of an annualized $600 million run rate for our new products exiting Q4 of 2013. 
As a company, we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. As an update on the cost reduction activities, we are on track to our cost savings goal. Since the end of the quarter, we have taken steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 500 positions. This essentially completes our planned workforce reduction. We have also made good progress in our supply chain and procurement activities, and we anticipate that the majority of the $150 million savings will be in operating expenses, and there will be some savings that will be realized in both product and services cost of goods sold. I'm pleased with the focus on efficiency within the company, and I'm confident that we will continue to make good progress towards our cost reduction objectives. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to range from $1,000,000,100  to $1,130,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. 
Operating expenses are expected to be roughly flat with the third quarter. The benefit of our cost reduction activities will largely offset the typical sequential increase in OpEx in the fourth quarter. We expect operating margin to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.19 and $0.22 assuming a flat share count a tax rate of 32% and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we continue to drive improvements in our capital structure. We are driving top line revenue growth with our innovative products, and we are aligning our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiency. 
Now I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

When we look at the project, the project run rate projects that we're doing and that doesn't always translate to specific revenue in that quarter but the outlook on projects and the work that we're doing in the U.S. I would say is positive. In Europe, we had a reasonable quarter on the Service Provider side, but we are very still a lot of softness, and we're very cautious on the outlook in Europe. And Asia Pacific, we had good performance in China but Asia Pacific I would characterize it as very stable. On the Enterprise side, we saw good Enterprise were falling APAC and EMEA and some softness in the U.S. The softness in the U.S. is primary driven by federal and financial services.

So when that customers look at making buying decisions, the look at really fundamentally 2 things. Total cost of ownership and then the ability to generate revenue from new services from the network on the service providers I'd. So total cost of orders are point of view, certainly with the PTX that's a great way to simplify the network both CapEx in terms of cost per bit and power usage and then OpEx as you simplify. Very similar on the T4000, where we give you to a very simple way to upgrade the existing infrastructure to get's a lower cost per bit. At the Edge network, it's a combination of 2 things. It really is total cost of ownership so certainly the MX enhancements that we outlined, shipping next quarter with the MX2000 series. Those drive down the total cost of ownership and also give customer great investment protection story. But then on top of that, this generate revenues. So the ability of Junos to evolve support the Juno sVApp engine so you can have multiple services at the Edge of the network reduces the time it takes for service to generate revenues. So those 2 things really drive adoption and as always have a long-term view of architectural transitions."

I would say in terms of a number of upgrades very consistent of the uptick that we see with the T1600. As customers are more careful about their spend, which we do see, they might upgrade the chassis first and plug in one of the new denser line cards and then hold off and upgrading the rest. So we think that this cycle may take a little bit longer and a little bit more sort of flatter in terms of the uptake just because of the spending environment. But overall in terms of number of T4000s out there, a number of customers that's qualified it, very much in line with the T1600 experience. And so this will evolve over multiple years, right? And that's what we saw with the T1600 as well as. And as all always, our customers will sort of apply the quarter-to-quarter spending discipline to how they upgrade the infrastructure. On the PTX, we've really seen a play out to where this is complementary to the T4000 upgrade. There are a number of customers that have both T4000 and PTX and working on both. The PTX helps us redefine the architecture and helps us take share in the quarter as we see that play out. There is an opportunity to merge networks into one like we saw from Verizon last quarter. So these are the kinds of opportunities that will drive our growth going forward, and that opens up growth for us in those networks."

So we see that as an area where we have a very good market position. It is the Service Provider market so like everything with service providers, it is lumpy. And so that means the performance could vary quarter-to-quarter, but we do see this is a long-term trend, in which we remain very well-positioned. You didn't ask specifically about the Enterprise, but I'll comment a little bit more on that, while them at up. As we described before, we are in a position of really driving forward and engaging in the Enterprise space. We've had some areas where we've not been as strong as we would like to be particularly around things like manageability. And we have a very strong program to bring out a new product set to dramatically improve our manageability and security design product. We had a great deal of engagement with customers of all types with this with very positive feedback from all of them. We have a very significant release of that coming out later this quarter, as well as incremental updates of that in the first half of next year where we expect to be very well-positioned. The other thing I'll say overall is about our engagement with Enterprise is that we are telling and talking to them about an end-to-end integrated security strategy, which they find very, very important and that is an enabling us to have a different level of engagement with these Enterprise customers. And that does not translate into revenue immediately, but it does provides a good long-term potential."

Number one, I think it's clear that on the Service Provider side, networks are running hotter, especially when you look at some of the capital expenditures in Europe",405,"Yes, for the question just. The answer for my perspective at the high level is 2 things. Number one, I think it's clear that on the Service Provider side, networks are running hotter, especially when you look at some of the capital expenditures in Europe as an example and even through the first half of this calendar year, the addressable market for routing had declined by about 3 -- 3 percentage points. Yet network traffic I believe continues to increase in many cases and putting pressure on or increasing the utilization of these networks. So number one factor is network running hotter, which means at some point investment cycle need to kick in. Number two is product cycle. I think a look at routing specifically for service providers, when you look at from the core with what we've done with PTX and T4000, to the Edge and aggregation to what we've done with MX from even with this new release of the MX2000 family and the software assets on top of the MX. And then all the way to the access layer with the ACX. I think we have got a very rich portfolio of technology and solutions of that is differentiated from competition, and that, combined with the fiber networks are running hotter, I think positions us well for the future. And your second part of your question is can you quantify that, and I'm hesitant to do that because much of that's going to depends on factors as we go into 2013 that are going to have to do with the macro and investment cycles. So I think consistent with the comments Robyn made at the analyst meeting it's our intention to really focus on how we can run this company in a way that we are able to grow faster than the addressable markets. And I think with the things we've done from an innovation standpoint, from a product standpoint, when it comes to routing, I think we're very well-positioned, certainly with switching and what we've done with QFabric. I think we continue to take share, and we're well-positioned going forward and Bob's comments on security, are consistent with the view that we've got a strong value proposition and Service Provider, and we've been taking actions over this last year to strengthen our hand in Enterprise. I feel like those are all the right set of things for us to be doing."

Look, the engineering work that we do and innovation we drive is intended to continue to reduce the cost per bit of traffic carried through new innovation and technology in the silicon, in the systems, in the way that comes together with the software.

And then certainly the third part is if traffic, if networks are -- if traffic isn't growing as rapidly and networks aren't running as hot, does that have implications in terms of the timing of investments. Certainly every network is different but it would have difference in timing customers are going to look to pay capital work to make the most impact for them in their business and sometimes that's in the core when the core gets running too hot, sometimes that's in the Edge. And as Stefan commented earlier on the edges of the network, it's not just about cost per bit carried but services in the way they're monetizing of those services with their customers.

Use the word sense of urgency, do we see some certain of urgency on the spending pattern in service providers. I wouldn't characterize it as a sense of urgency. What I would characterize we're seeing is a very disciplined planning approach that is creating new projects and new need to do upgrades on networks. It's not a sense of urgency to react to adding capacity, but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and discipline in the planning and that planning results in very clear projects with very clear business objectives that customers are trying to achieve. And I feel like well look over the last 6 months, I think we've secured a number of wins and commitments from these customers where we competed for these projects, and we've been awarded these projects. Some of these projects have kicked off, some are going to kick off in 2013. But I think that is an indicator that there is clearly value in the investments that they're looking to make, those investments are aligned with key business outcomes. They're looking to drive and the technology footprint that we have and innovation we've delivered is aligning with their business need. I think that, combined with the product cycle that we're in, having strength in with the T4000, PTX and the core routing footprint, strength in the Edge with what we've done with MX and expanding that systems platform along with the new software services that Bob highlighted, and then moving us even forward into the access layer, I think that makes us a more competitive, more relevant player that has a fuller portfolio to solve these problems.

So they are looking to reduce the total cost of ownership and their speed and cost to service by considering the right architectural transitions that they should make in the network. And that, coupled with what products can fulfill that, and certainly just like we saw on the MX a couple of years ago, we feel very good about those product cycles that are coming to market now. And that's always going to be a key driver for our business."

All of our major financial metrics were in line or ahead of our guided ranges in what continues to be a challenging environment. We remain focused on those things that are within our control and on developing and delivering great solutions for our customers. 
During the third quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives we outlined broadly in last quarter's conference call. We have streamlined our organization, consolidated functional overlap and clarified our priorities. These actions are designed to best align the company's resources with our strategic priorities. They will also allow us to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. We do this with a clear recognition that it is the culture of innovation within our company that enables our customers' business success and creates value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll focus my comments today on how we are performing in the market, including our progress relative to our new products. I also want to address some of the questions I know many of you have on the increasing industry focus around network programmability and software-defined networks, referred to as SDN. These are areas where we are very active. Robyn will walk you through some of the specifics on our financials, and we will conclude with Q&A that will include Bob Muglia and Stefan Dyckerhoff. 
Our total revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We continue to see healthy performance in our Service Provider business, including improving demand by our largest U.S. customers and good results in the EMEA and APAC regions. The Enterprise story is mixed, with good quarter-over-quarter growth driven by EMEA and APAC, but offset somewhat by softness in the Americas. Our Service Provider revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We continue to expect to see a more typical pattern of Service Provider spend within the industry, with second half investment levels higher than first. 
I'm pleased to note that the upgrade cycle relative to the T4000 core routers is underway and customer engagement around PTX is very strong. Our PTX product complements our T4000 core routers by collapsing multiple existing core networks into a single MPLS-based transport network, and we're seeing good customer feedback for both products. These innovations provide us competitive differentiation. With PTX in particular, we now have more than 15 customers, including recent strategic wins with companies like Optus in Australia and XO Communications here in the U.S. We believe we are off to a very promising start with PTX.
We had a good quarter in Edge routing, and we continue to build on the success of our flagship MX platform. Earlier this month, we announced the industry's most powerful Edge routing platform, the MX2020, to enable rapid service creation and service delivery. It's the only Edge platform capable of delivering broadband, mobile and business services on one platform. In addition, we announced a series of software offerings that include our service delivery gateway and the JunosV App Engine, that offers a broad set of solutions on the MX. 
Switching revenue was up solidly both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to take share with the EX with recent customer wins such as Suncore, the top 5 North American energy company. We also continue to win new customers with QFabric. Recent wins include the University of Frankfurt and in the APAC region, BOCI, a leading cross-border platform provider for diversified financial services firms in China. BOCI is one of several customers deploying our QFabric M as its new data center core. 
We're making good progress in rebuilding momentum in security. We grew in low-double digits on a percentage basis quarter-on-quarter. Demand for high-end SRX within the Service Provider sector was also strong this quarter, growing quarter-on-quarter. But we also saw gains across most of our product families, lending to our confidence that our security business is beginning to stabilize. 
We're making good progress towards the objective we laid out at the analyst meeting to exit 2013 with an annualized run rate of $600 million in new product revenue. QFabric, PTX and T4000 each posted good revenue in the third quarter. The ACX Universal Access product family began shipping in Q3 and MX2020 will bring in shipping in Q4. MobileNext is now running production traffic with one of our mobility customers, and we continue to engage with additional customers on insertion opportunities with our mobile packet core solution.
As we talk about new products and innovation, I want to address network programmability and what we're doing around software-defined networks. We have a few key pillars that define our SDN strategy. First, we continue to believe that a software-driven network platform will ultimately deliver maximum business value for our customers. This is division behind of the network that we laid out 3 years ago and continue to deliver upon. Junos is a key pillar of this programmability strategy. Next, we believe that the focus of SDN is initially around data center switching. The data center is where SDN solutions can drive the most business value for customers. Today, we have a data center fabric solution in market with QFabric. It was architected with some common principles of SDN. For example, our QFabric Director, at its essence, is a software-driven controller for the QFabric system. So we have this foundation to build on as we continue to evolve QFabric in our entire data center portfolio. 
We know that lots of people are building SDN controllers. What that means for us is that we need to make sure our network systems work with as many of those controllers as possible. Open standards have always been a core underpinning of our innovation strategy. That means our systems need to support SDN protocols, including OpenFlow, and that's exactly what we're delivering. We initially demonstrated OpenFlow on the MX in 2011, and this year we extended that to the EX. We will have a productized version of OpenFlow 1.3 on the MX, EX and QFabric next year, so that our data center solutions can inter-operate with these many SDN controllers that are being built. 
We are actively engaging with several customers on the use cases where we think SDN can deliver the most value. We have a solution that is architected with SDN principles in QFabric running in many customers' data centers today. We continue to gain traction with customers as we build out our feature sets. We are also building SDN APIs including OpenFlow into our systems. And as we do this throughout our product roadmap, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio. We think we're making pretty good progress. 
I'll wrap up my comments by reiterating that we executed well in the third quarter, and we took the necessary steps to restructure the company to sharpen our focus on the right priorities, enable agility and drive efficiencies across the company. The actions we are taking to align our resources with our strategic priorities are ahead of schedule and that further strengthens our position as we look to drive revenue growth in 2013. The macro environment probably isn't going to become anymore certain in the near term, but we continue to focus on our own execution as we manage through this in line with our operating principles.  We believe our traction is increasing across all 3 of our product areas; routing, switching and security, and that includes our new products as we move towards the expectation we set at our analyst meeting in June. 
Before I hand over to Robyn, I want to note that we also issued a press release today regarding our Platform Systems division. Stefan Dyckerhoff's role within Juniper will be changing. After many successful years as an operating executive, Stefan has made the decision to pursue a career as a venture capitalist. At the same time, Stefan will remain actively engaged with Juniper. Beginning in January 2013, he will transition to a new role as a staff consultant, supporting me and the executive team. In this role, he will continue to work with the executive team on strategy and some key customer engagements. 
As Stefan shifts into his new role, I'm pleased to note that Rami Rahim, a 15-year Juniper veteran and key architect of our routing portfolio, will succeeds Stefan in the leadership role of PSD. Stefan will work closely with Rami to ensure a smooth transition. 
Stefan, would you like to add a few comments?"

I have worked with Rami for many years, and he has played a key role in Juniper's success to date. I'm confident that he is the right executive to lead the Platform Systems division, and I look forward to working with him, both during the transition phase and then throughout 2013 as an advisor.

Juniper delivered third quarter revenue growth on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and we improved our operational performance. While many customers remain cautious in an uncertain near-term environment, we continue to see positive long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking. 
We are focused on the things we can control. So let me update you on our progress with our cost structure initiatives. Last quarter, we announced that efforts were underway to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model. The team has initiated multiple actions, including a reduction in our workforce of approximately 500 positions, supply chain and procurement activities, as well as several facility consolidations and other cost saving measures.  In the third quarter, these actions have resulted in pretax charges of $83 million, associated primarily with workforce reductions, inventory, facility and other asset write-downs. 
We expect to have additional charges in the next several quarters primarily related to facilities and other asset write-downs. Our employees remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution, and I would like to thank them for their hard work and ongoing commitment during this turbulent time. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, the book-to-bill was greater than one, with product deferred revenue and product backlog increasing sequentially. Customer demand this quarter for T4000 and PTX reflected design wins with good adoption across all 3 geographies. 
Total revenue was $1,118,000,000, an increase of 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to growth in APAC and EMEA across both the Service Provider and Enterprise sectors. The year-over-year increase was due to U.S. Service Provider and International Enterprise growth. 
For the third quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. This reflected the impact of the charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.06 year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected our revenue growth and improved operational performance. 
Now, let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to U.S. Enterprise. The year-over-year increase reflected Service Provider growth, particularly in large U.S. carriers. 
EMEA revenue was up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. This increase over the last quarter reflected improved Enterprise revenue and some new wins in Service Provider. While we did see revenue improvement this quarter, we still see a soft demand environment in the region.
APAC revenue was up 26% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year, with sequential increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. We saw good growth across the region particularly in China. 
Now, let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $893 million, up 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, which was flat sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Our new products continue to gain traction in the marketplace. We have seen good engagement in all 3 geographies on both T4000 and the PTX core products. 
Year-over-year, we saw good growth from the MX products and as anticipated, the older products of M&E were the main reason for the year-over-year decline in routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 2% sequentially to $514 million. Total switching product revenue increased 4% sequentially and 19% year-over-year to $146 million. We continue to take share with our portfolio of EX and QFabric switching products. 
SSD revenue in the quarter was $225 million, up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $178 million, up 12% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected gains across most product families. 
High end SRX product revenue increased 18% sequentially and was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting Service Provider deployment timing. And we expect continued revenue fluctuations for this product. Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, continues to make good progress with Enterprise customers and was up $0.07 sequentially and 2% year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $705 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential growth was due to improved performance with large Service Providers globally and content service providers. Enterprise revenue was $413 million, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new financial services and public sector account wins in EMEA and APAC. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue in the U.S. Federal and Financial Services sector compared to strong third quarter of last year. 
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased to 65.6% compared to 63.4% last quarter. While the sequential increase reflected our continued supply chain efficiency improvements, approximately 100 basis points of the increase was due to items, which we do not expect to recur. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.8% versus 64.7% in the quarter. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.2%, up 2.8 points from the prior quarter, reflecting productivity improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially to $544 million due to the timing of additional prototype costs, annual employee merit awards and higher variable expenses. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,584 employees and this does not reflect the impact of our workforce reduction, which I discussed earlier.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. This sequential increase of 1.9 points was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, with operating expenses flat as a percentage of revenue. The GAAP tax rate was 56.7% for the quarter. This is up sequentially due primarily to the effect of the restructuring and other associated charges. The non-GAAP tax rate was 34.4%. This is higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of income. And as a reminder, the tax rates reflect no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investment. Cash flow from operations was $173 million. DSO was a healthy 32 days in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, capital expenditures were down slightly and depreciation was up slightly. We continue to move ahead with our build out of our Sunnyvale Campus. This enables our facility consolidation. We repurchased 13.9 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $18. We have $818 million remaining on our current authorization, and we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. Based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to continue to do more. 
Now, I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. 
At this point there is no evidence of any indication of the significant improvement in the spending environment over the next few quarters. We expect customers to remain cautious with their investment decisions. We are pleased with the progress towards the new product revenue goal that we discussed at FAM of an annualized $600 million run rate for our new products exiting Q4 of 2013. 
As a company, we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. As an update on the cost reduction activities, we are on track to our cost savings goal. Since the end of the quarter, we have taken steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 500 positions. This essentially completes our planned workforce reduction. We have also made good progress on our supply chain and procurement activities, and we anticipate that the majority of the $150 million savings will be in operating expenses, and there will be some savings that will be realized in both product and services cost of goods sold. I'm pleased with the focus on efficiency within the company, and I'm confident that we will continue to make good progress towards our cost reduction objectives. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,100,000,000 to $1,130,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. 
Operating expenses are expected to be roughly flat with the third quarter. The benefit of our cost reduction activities will largely offset the typical sequential increase in OpEx in the fourth quarter. We expect operating margin to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.19 and $0.22 assuming a flat share count a tax rate of 32% and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we continue to drive improvements in our capital structure. We are driving top line revenue growth with our innovative products, and we are aligning our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. 
Now I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

SRX showed sequential growth and flat year-over-year, and I think when we look at those combined with what we see happening with PTX and T, it gives us a positive sense on how product, value proposition of the product. When you look by sector, there's some variances there. Certainty the U.S., we're seeing stronger demand from service providers. When we look at the project, the project run rate in the set of projects that we're doing and that doesn't always translate to a specific revenue in that quarter, but the outlook on projects and the work that we're doing in the U.S., I would say, is positive. In Europe, we had a reasonable quarter on the Service Provider side, but we're very -- still a lot of softness, and we're very cautious on the outlook in Europe. In Asia Pacific, we had a good performance in China but were -- Asia Pacific, I would characterize this as very stable. On the Enterprise side, we saw good Enterprise performance in APAC and EMEA and some softness in the U.S. And the softness in the U.S. is primary driven by Federal and Financial Services. So you net debt together, I think, overall, when we look at product revenue and, as Robyn pointed out, backlog and deferred product revenue, we feel like we're making a reasonable progress."

I'll take that one, Robyn. I think first of all, with the PTX and the T4000, as those products were released, certainly, customers go through the process of certification and testing them in their labs before they begin deployment. And I think we commented, we now have 15 customers of PTX who are in various stages of that process. On the T4000, there's a process they go through, where they -- first, they upgrade the T Series chassis to be able to handle T4000 line cards. And what we've seen thus far is some good progress on the chassis upgrades and, yes, I think there's still a wave of line card upgrades to come and that's a function of as customers look at their investment priority and they look at the network -- how hot their network is running and where they need to deploy their capital. Certainty, we think we're positioned for that. And then the MX continues to be a very solid product across the dimension, the wireless, the wireline and the business services that our customers deliver. So I don't think there's any one specific thing, but it's a wide range of things. And maybe, Stefan, I'll ask if there's any additional color you want to add for Stephen."

I think what we're seeing here is kind of the continuation execution of a strategy that we had outlined. So when our customers look at making buying decisions, they look at really fundamentally 2 things: Total cost of ownership and then the ability to generate revenue from new services from the network on the service provider side. So from a total cost of ownership point of view, certainly with the PTX, that's a great way to simplify the network drive down both CapEx, in terms of cost per bit and power usage; and then OpEx, as you simplify. Very similar on the T4000, where we give you a very simple way to upgrade the existing infrastructure to get to a lower cost per bit. At the Edge network, it's a combination of 2 things. It really is total cost of ownership. So certainly, the MX enhancements that we outlined that are shipping next quarter with the MX2000 series, those drive down the total cost of ownership and also give customer great investment protection story. But then on top of that, this is where service providers generate revenue. So the ability of Junos to evolve support the JunosV App engine so you can have multiple services at the edge of the network reduces the time it takes for service provider to generate revenue. So, those 2 things really drive adoption and, as always, the service providers have a long-term view of these architectural transitions."

I would say, in terms of a number of upgrades, it's very consistent to the kind of uptake that we see with the T1600. As customers are more careful about their spend, which we do see, they might upgrade the chassis first and plug in one of the new denser line cards and then hold off on upgrading the rest. So, we think that this cycle might take a little bit longer and be a little bit more sort of flatter in terms of the uptake just because of the spending environment. But overall, in terms of number of T4000s out there, number of customers that's qualified it, very much in line with the T1600 experience. And so this will evolve over multiple years, right? And that's what we saw with the T1600 as well. And as all always, our customers will sort of apply the quarter-to-quarter spending discipline to how they upgrade the infrastructure. On the PTX, we've really seen a play out to where this is complementary to the T4000 upgrade. There are a number of customers that have both T4000 and PTX and working on both. The PTX helps us redefine the architecture and helps us take share in the quarter, I think, as we see that play out. There is an opportunity to merge networks into one like we saw from Verizon last quarter. So these are the kinds of opportunities that will drive our growth going forward, and that opens up growth for us in those networks."

In terms of the SRX and the growth we saw quarter-to-quarter on that in Service Provider, what we're seeing is a wave of deployments around emerging wireless networks, predominantly LTE, which have higher bandwidth requirements which the SRX is particularly well-suited for. So we see that as an area where we have a very good market position. It is the Service Provider market. So like everything with service providers, it is lumpy. And so that means the performance could vary quarter-to-quarter, but we do see this as a long-term trend, in which we remain very well-positioned. You didn't ask specifically about the Enterprise, but I'll comment a little bit more on that, while I'm at it. As we've described before, we are in a position of really driving forward and reengaging in the Enterprise space. We've had some areas there where we've not been as strong as we'd like to be, particularly around things like manageability, and we have a very strong program to bring out a new product set to dramatically improve our manageability and security design product. We've had a great deal of engagement with customers of all types with this, with very positive feedback from all of them. We have a very significant release of that coming out later this quarter, as well as incremental updates of that in the first half of next year where we expect to be very well-positioned. The other thing I'll say overall is about our engagement with Enterprise is that we are telling and talking to them about an end-to-end integrated security strategy, which they find very, very important and that is enabling us to have a different level of engagement with these Enterprise customers. And that does not translate into revenue immediately, but it does provide a good long-term potential."

The answer from my perspective at a high level is 2 things: Number one, I think it's clear that on the Service Provider side, networks are running hotter, especially when you look at some of the capital expenditures in Europe, as an example, and even through the first half of this calendar year, the addressable market for routing had declined by about 3  percentage points. Yet network traffic, I believe, continues to increase in many cases and putting pressure on, or increasing the utilization of these networks. So number one factor is network's running hotter, which means at some point investment cycles need to kick in. And number two, it's our product cycle. I think I look at routing specifically for service providers, when you look at from the core what we've done with PTX and T4000, to the Edge and aggregation to what we've done with MX from even with this new release of the MX2000 family and the software assets on top of the MX. And then all the way to the access layer with the ACX. I think we have got a very rich portfolio of technology and solutions that is differentiated from competition, and that, combined with the fact that networks are running hotter, I think, positions us well for the future. And your second part of your question is can you quantify that, and I'm hesitant to do that because much of that is going to depend on factors as we go into 2013 that are going to have to do with the macro and investment cycles. So I think consistent with the comments Robyn made at the analyst meeting. Look, it's our intent to really focus on how we can run this company in a way that we're able to grow faster than the addressable markets. And I think with the things we've done from an innovation standpoint, from a product standpoint, when it comes to routing, I think we're very well-positioned, certainly with switching and what we've done in QFabric, I think we continue to take share, and we're well-positioned going forward and Bob's comments on security are consistent with the view that we've got a strong value proposition in Service Provider, and we've been taking actions over this last year to strengthen our hand in Enterprise.

We've got a very strong focus on data center scenarios and a great solution for the campus and branch as well. But Stefan, you want to add to that one?"

So I think I attribute much of that to the fact that the release of the QFabric M interconnect has enabled an entry point for customers now that are now doing more of those deployments. I don't have specific numbers, I apologize on that, but the way I would characterize an answer to your question was this quarter was much more about the full QFabric systems, where in prior quarters, I think there was a lot of groundwork laid for QFabric nodes that are now being connected together into the full data center solution."

I'll first comment then I'll hand over to Stefan. Look, the engineering work that we do and the innovation we drive is intended to continue to reduce the cost per bit of traffic carried through new innovation and technology in the silicon, in the systems, in the way that comes together with the software. So that's been true for the last 10 or 20 years, as we focused on continuing to innovate and drive down the cost per bit of traffic carried. The second part of your question then is, does that create value proposition for customers? I believe the answer is yes. And then certainly the third part is, if traffic -- if networks are -- if traffic isn't growing as rapidly and networks aren't running as hot, does that have implications in terms of the timing of investments? And certainly every network is different but it would have difference in timing. Customers are going to look to make -- to put their capital where it can make the most impact for them in their business and sometimes that's in the core, when the core gets running too hot. Sometimes that's in the edge. And as Stefan commented earlier on the edge of the network, it's not just about cost per bit carried but it's new services and the way they're monetizing those new services with their customers. So there's a variety of ways that we have to add value to our customers. So Stefan you want to add to that?"

And fundamentally, the growth of traffic, I mean, is still outstripping what Moore's Law gives you, right? So you how to really invest in the silicon, in the systems to keep up with that growth of traffic. And our customers always push us to build bigger and bigger systems to address this problem. In terms of how they run their networks, as Kevin mentioned, they upgrade their networks for multiple reasons in terms of how hot they run it, where they put capabilities in the network and they'll make those different trade-offs. But their fundamentally going to choose to upgrade if they can either reduce the total cost of ownership or generate new services in addition to the underlying demand curve that drives their business."

You used the word sense of urgency, do we see some certain of urgency on the spending pattern in service providers? I wouldn't characterize it as a sense of urgency. What I would characterize we are seeing is a very disciplined planning approach that is creating new projects and new need to do upgrades on networks. It's not a sense of urgency to react to adding capacity, but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and discipline in the planning and that planning results in very clear projects with very clear business objectives that customers are trying to achieve. And I feel like if I look over the last 6 months, I think we've secured a number of wins and commitments from these customers where we've competed for these projects, and we've been awarded these projects. Some of these projects have kicked off, some are going to kick off in 2013. But I think that is an indicator that there is clearly value in the investments that they're looking to make, those investments are aligned with key business outcomes they're looking to drive. And the technology footprint that we have and innovation we've delivered is aligning with their business need. I think that, combined with the product cycle that we're in, having strength with the T4000, PTX and the core routing footprint, strength in the Edge with what we've done with MX and expanding that systems platform along with the new software services that Bob highlighted, and then moving us even forward into the access layer, I think that makes us a more competitive, more relevant player that has a fuller portfolio to solve these problems. And so those 2 things, I think, are very positive indicators.  Stefan, you want to add to that?"

So they are looking to reduce the total cost of ownership and their speed and cost to service by considering the right architectural transitions that they should make in the network.

All of our major financial metrics were in line or ahead of our guided ranges in what continues to be a challenging environment. We remain focused on those things that are within our control and on developing and delivering great solutions for our customers. 
During the third quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives we outlined broadly in last quarter's conference call. We have streamlined our organization, consolidated functional overlap and clarified our priorities. These actions are designed to best align the company's resources with our strategic priorities. They will also allow us to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. We do this with a clear recognition that it is the culture of innovation within our company that enables our customers' business success and creates value for all our stakeholders. 
I'll focus my comments today on how we are performing in the market, including our progress relative to our new products. I also want to address some of the questions I know many of you have on the increasing industry focus around network programmability and software-defined networks, referred to as SDN. These are areas where we are very active. Robyn will walk you through some of the specifics on our financials, and we will conclude with Q&A that will include Bob Muglia and Stefan Dyckerhoff. 
Our total revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We continue to see healthy performance in our Service Provider business, including improving demand by our largest U.S. customers and good results in the EMEA and APAC regions. The Enterprise story is mixed, with good quarter-over-quarter growth driven by EMEA and APAC, but offset somewhat by softness in the Americas. Our Service Provider revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We continue to expect to see a more typical pattern of Service Provider spend within the industry, with second half investment levels higher than first. 
I'm pleased to note that the upgrade cycle relative to the T4000 core routers is underway and customer engagement around PTX is very strong. Our PTX product complements our T4000 core routers by collapsing multiple existing core networks into a single MPLS-based transport network, and we're seeing good customer feedback for both products. These innovations provide us competitive differentiation. With PTX in particular, we now have more than 15 customers, including recent strategic wins with companies like Optus in Australia and XO Communications here in the U.S. We believe we are off to a very promising start with PTX.
We had a good quarter in Edge routing, and we continue to build on the success of our flagship MX platform. Earlier this month, we announced the industry's most powerful Edge routing platform, the MX2020, to enable rapid service creation and service delivery. It's the only Edge platform capable of delivering broadband, mobile and business services on one platform. In addition, we announced a series of software offerings that include our service delivery gateway and the JunosV App Engine, that offers a broad set of solutions on the MX. 
Switching revenue was up solidly both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to take share with the EX with recent customer wins such as Suncor, the top 5 North American energy company. We also continue to win new customers with QFabric. Recent wins include the University of Frankfurt and in the APAC region, BOCI, a leading cross-border platform provider for diversified financial services firms in China. BOCI is one of several customers deploying our QFabric M as its new data center core. 
We're making good progress in rebuilding momentum in security. We grew in low-double digits on a percentage basis quarter-on-quarter. Demand for high-end SRX within the Service Provider sector was also strong this quarter, growing quarter-on-quarter. But we also saw gains across most of our product families, lending to our confidence that our security business is beginning to stabilize. 
We're making good progress towards the objective we laid out at the Analyst Meeting to exit 2013 with an annualized run rate of $600 million in new product revenue. QFabric, PTX and T4000 each posted good revenue in the third quarter. The ACX Universal Access product family began shipping in Q3 and MX2020 will begin shipping in Q4. MobileNext is now running production traffic with one of our mobility customers, and we continue to engage with additional customers on insertion opportunities with our mobile packet core solution.
As we talk about new products and innovation, I want to address network programmability and what we're doing around software-defined networks. We have a few key pillars that define our SDN strategy. First, we continue to believe that a software-driven network platform will ultimately deliver maximum business value for our customers. This is the vision behind the new network that we laid out 3 years ago and continue to deliver upon. Junos is a key pillar of this programmability strategy. Next, we believe that the focus of SDN is initially around data center switching. The data center is where SDN solutions can drive the most business value for customers. Today, we have a data center fabric solution in market with QFabric. It was architected with some common principles of SDN. For example, our QFabric Director, at its essence, is a software-driven controller for the QFabric system. So we have this foundation to build on as we continue to evolve QFabric in our entire data center portfolio. 
We know that lots of people are building SDN controllers. What that means for us is that we need to make sure our network systems work with as many of those controllers as possible. Open standards have always been a core underpinning of our innovation strategy. That means our systems need to support SDN protocols, including OpenFlow, and that's exactly what we're delivering. We initially demonstrated OpenFlow on the MX in 2011, and this year we extended that to the EX. We will have a productized version of OpenFlow 1.3 on the MX, EX and QFabric next year, so that our data center solutions can inter-operate with these many SDN controllers that are being built. 
We are actively engaging with several customers on the use cases where we think SDN can deliver the most value. We have a solution that is architected with SDN principles in QFabric running in many customers' data centers today. We continue to gain traction with customers as we build out our feature sets. We are also building SDN APIs including OpenFlow into our systems. And as we do this throughout our product roadmap, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio. We think we're making pretty good progress. 
I'll wrap up my comments by reiterating that we executed well in the third quarter, and we took the necessary steps to restructure the company to sharpen our focus on the right priorities, enable agility and drive efficiencies across the company. The actions we are taking to align our resources with our strategic priorities are ahead of schedule and that further strengthens our position as we look to drive revenue growth in 2013. The macro environment probably isn't going to become any more certain in the near term, but we continue to focus on our own execution as we manage through this in line with our operating principles.  We believe our traction is increasing across all 3 of our product areas; routing, switching and security, and that includes our new products as we move towards the expectation we set at our Analyst Meeting in June. 
Before I hand over to Robyn, I want to note that we also issued a press release today regarding our Platform Systems division. Stefan Dyckerhoff's role within Juniper will be changing. After many successful years as an operating executive, Stefan has made the decision to pursue a career as a venture capitalist. At the same time, Stefan will remain actively engaged with Juniper. Beginning in January 2013, he will transition to a new role as a staff consultant, supporting me and the executive team. In this role, he will continue to work with the executive team on strategy and some key customer engagements. 
As Stefan shifts into his new role, I'm pleased to note that Rami Rahim, a 15-year Juniper veteran and key architect of our routing portfolio, will succeed Stefan in the leadership role of PSD. Stefan will work closely with Rami to ensure a smooth transition. 
Stefan, would you like to add a few comments?"

Juniper delivered third quarter revenue growth on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and we improved our operational performance. While many customers remain cautious in an uncertain near-term environment, we continue to see positive long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking. 
We are focused on the things we can control. So let me update you on our progress with our cost structure initiatives. Last quarter, we announced that efforts were underway to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model. The team has initiated multiple actions, including a reduction in our workforce of approximately 500 positions, supply chain and procurement activities, as well as several facility consolidations and other cost saving measures.  In the third quarter, these actions have resulted in pretax charges of $83 million, associated primarily with workforce reductions, inventory, facility and other asset write-downs. 
We expect to have additional charges in the next several quarters primarily related to facilities and other asset write-downs. Our employees remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution, and I would like to thank them for their hard work and ongoing commitment during this turbulent time. 
Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, the book-to-bill was greater than one, with product deferred revenue and product backlog increasing sequentially. Customer demand this quarter for T4000 and PTX reflected design wins with good adoption across all 3 geographies. 
Total revenue was $1,118,000,000, an increase of 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to growth in APAC and EMEA across both the Service Provider and Enterprise sectors. The year-over-year increase was due to U.S. Service Provider and International Enterprise growth. 
For the third quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. This reflected the impact of the charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.06 year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected our revenue growth and improved operational performance. 
Now, let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to U.S. Enterprise. The year-over-year increase reflected Service Provider growth, particularly in large U.S. carriers. 
EMEA revenue was up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. This increase over last quarter reflected improved Enterprise revenue and some new wins in Service Provider. While we did see revenue improvement this quarter, we still see a soft demand environment in the region.
APAC revenue was up 26% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year, with sequential increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. We saw good growth across the region, particularly in China. 
Now, let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $893 million, up 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, which was flat sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Our new products continue to gain traction in the marketplace. We have seen good engagement in all 3 geographies on both T4000 and the PTX core products. 
Year-over-year, we saw good growth from the MX products and as anticipated, the older products of M&E were the main reason for the year-over-year decline in routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 2% sequentially to $514 million. Total switching product revenue increased 4% sequentially and 19% year-over-year to $146 million. We continue to take share with our portfolio of EX and QFabric switching products. 
SSD revenue in the quarter was $225 million, up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $178 million, up 12% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected gains across most product families. 
High end SRX product revenue increased 18% sequentially and was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting Service Provider deployment timing. And we expect continued revenue fluctuations for this product. Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, continues to make good progress with Enterprise customers and was up 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. 
Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $705 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential growth was due to improved performance with large Service Providers globally and content service providers. Enterprise revenue was $413 million, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new financial services and public sector account wins in EMEA and APAC. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue in the U.S. Federal and Financial Services sector compared to strong third quarter of last year. 
Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased to 65.6% compared to 63.4% last quarter. While the sequential increase reflected our continued supply chain efficiency improvements, approximately 100 basis points of the increase was due to items, which we do not expect to recur. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.8% versus 64.7% in the quarter. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.2%, up 2.8 points from the prior quarter, reflecting productivity improvement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially to $544 million due to the timing of additional prototype costs, annual employee merit awards and higher variable expenses. 
Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,584 employees and this does not reflect the impact of our workforce reduction, which I discussed earlier.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. This sequential increase of 1.9 points was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, with operating expenses flat as a percentage of revenue. The GAAP tax rate was 56.7% for the quarter. This is up sequentially due primarily to the effect of the restructuring and other associated charges. The non-GAAP tax rate was 34.4%. This is higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of income. And as a reminder, the tax rates reflect no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $173 million. DSO was a healthy 32 days in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, capital expenditures were down slightly and depreciation was up slightly. We continue to move ahead with our build out of our Sunnyvale Campus. This enables our facility consolidation. We repurchased 13.9 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $18. We have $818 million remaining on our current authorization, and we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. Based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to continue to do more. 
Now, I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. 
At this point, there is no evidence of any indication of a significant improvement in the spending environment over the next few quarters. We expect customers to remain cautious with their investment decisions. We are pleased with the progress towards the new product revenue goal that we discussed at FAM of an annualized $600 million run rate for our new products exiting Q4 of 2013. 
As a company, we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. As an update on the cost reduction activities, we are on track to our cost savings goal. Since the end of the quarter, we have taken steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 500 positions. This essentially completes our planned workforce reduction. We have also made good progress on our supply chain and procurement activities, and we anticipate that the majority of the $150 million savings will be in operating expenses, and there will be some savings that will be realized in both product and services cost of goods sold. I'm pleased with the focus on efficiency within the company, and I'm confident that we will continue to make good progress towards our cost reduction objectives. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,100,000,000 to $1,130,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. 
Operating expenses are expected to be roughly flat with the third quarter. The benefit of our cost reduction activities will largely offset the typical sequential increase in OpEx in the fourth quarter. We expect operating margin to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.19 and $0.22 per share assuming a flat share count a tax rate of 32% and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
In summary, we continue to drive improvements in our capital structure. We are driving top line revenue growth with our innovative products, and we are aligning our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. 
Now I will hand it over to the operator for questions."

When you look by sector, there's some variances there. Certainty the U.S., we're seeing stronger demand from service providers. When we look at the project, the project run rate and the set of projects that we're doing and that doesn't always translate to a specific revenue in that quarter, but the outlook on projects and the work that we're doing in the U.S., I would say, is positive. In Europe, we had a reasonable quarter on the Service Provider side, but we're very -- still a lot of softness, and we're very cautious on the outlook in Europe. In Asia Pacific, we had a good performance in China but were -- Asia Pacific, I would characterize this as very stable. On the Enterprise side, we saw good Enterprise performance in APAC and EMEA and some softness in the U.S. And the softness in the U.S. is primarily driven by Federal and Financial Services.

And what we've seen thus far is some good progress on the chassis upgrades and, yet, I think there's still a wave of line card upgrades to come and that's a function of as customers look at their investment priorities and they look at the network -- how hot their network is running and where they need to deploy their capital. Certainty, we think we're positioned for that. And then the MX continues to be a very solid product across the dimensions, the wireless, the wireline and the business services that our customers deliver.

I think what we're seeing here is kind of the continuation execution of a strategy that we had outlined. So when our customers look at making buying decisions, they look at really fundamentally 2 things: Total cost of ownership and then the ability to generate revenue from new services from the network on the service provider side. So from a total cost of ownership point of view, certainly with the PTX, that's a great way to simplify the network drive down both CapEx, in terms of cost per bit and power usage; and then OpEx, as you simplify. Very similar on the T4000, where we give you a very simple way to upgrade the existing infrastructure to get to a lower cost per bit. At the Edge network, it's a combination of 2 things. It really is total cost of ownership. So certainly, the MX enhancements that we outlined that are shipping next quarter with the MX2000 series, those drive down the total cost of ownership and also give the customer great investment protection story. But then on top of that, this is where service providers generate revenue. So the ability of Junos to evolve support the JunosV App engine so you can have multiple services at the edge of the network reduces the time it takes for service provider to generate revenue. So, those 2 things really drive adoption and, as always, the service providers have a long-term view of these architectural transitions."

And just the third product I wanted to touch on was the SRX, where you talked about the 18% sequential increase for the Service Provider segment, can you just expand on what drove that and, again, how broad-based it is and how sustainable it is?"

I would say, in terms of a number of upgrades, it's very consistent to the kind of uptake that we see with the T1600. As customers are more careful about their spend, which we do see, they might upgrade the chassis first and plug in one of the new denser line cards and then hold off on upgrading the rest. So, we think that this cycle might take a little bit longer and be a little bit more sort of flatter in terms of the uptake just because of the spending environment. But overall, in terms of number of T4000s out there, number of customers that's qualified it, very much in line with the T1600 experience. And so this will evolve over multiple years, right? And that's what we saw with the T1600 as well. And as all always, our customers will sort of apply the quarter-to-quarter spending discipline to how they upgrade the infrastructure. On the PTX, we've really seen it play out to where this is complementary to the T4000 upgrade. There are a number of customers that have both T4000 and PTX and working on both. The PTX helps us redefine the architecture and helps us take share in the core [ph] , I think, as we see that play out. There is an opportunity to merge networks into one like we saw from Verizon last quarter. So these are the kinds of opportunities that will drive our growth going forward, and that opens up growth for us in those networks."

In terms of the SRX and the growth we saw quarter-to-quarter on that in Service Provider, what we're seeing is a wave of deployments around emerging wireless networks, predominantly LTE, which have higher bandwidth requirements which the SRX is particularly well-suited for. So we see that as an area where we have a very good market position. It is the Service Provider market. So like everything with service providers, it is lumpy. And so that means the performance could vary quarter-to-quarter, but we do see this as a long-term trend, in which we remain very well-positioned. You didn't ask specifically about the Enterprise, but I'll comment a little bit more on that, while I'm at it. As we've described before, we are in a position of really driving forward and reengaging in the Enterprise space. We've had some areas there where we've not been as strong as we'd like to be, particularly around things like manageability, and we have a very strong program to bring out a new product set to dramatically improve our manageability and security design product. We've had a great deal of engagement with customers of all types with this, with very positive feedback from all of them. We have a very significant release of that coming out later this quarter, as well as incremental updates of that in the first half of next year where we expect to be very well-positioned. The other thing I'll say overall is about our engagement with Enterprise is, is that we are telling and talking to them about an end-to-end integrated security strategy, which they find very, very important and that is enabling us to have a different level of engagement with these Enterprise customers. And that does not translate into revenue immediately, but it does provide a good long-term potential."

The answer from my perspective at a high level is 2 things: Number one, I think it's clear that on the Service Provider side, networks are running hotter, especially when you look at some of the capital expenditures in Europe, as an example, and even through the first half of this calendar year, the addressable market for routing had declined by about 3 percentage points. Yet network traffic, I believe, continues to increase in many cases and putting pressure on, or increasing the utilization of these networks. So number one factor is networks running hotter, which means at some point investment cycles need to kick in. And number two, it's our product cycle. I think I look at routing specifically for service providers, when you look at from the core what we've done with PTX and T4000, to the Edge and aggregation to what we've done with MX from even with this new release of the MX2000 family and the software assets on top of the MX. And then all the way to the access layer with the ACX. I think we have got a very rich portfolio of technology and solutions that is differentiated from competition, and that, combined with the fact that networks are running hotter, I think, positions us well for the future. And your second part of your question is can you quantify that, and I'm hesitant to do that because much of that is going to depend on factors as we go into 2013 that are going to have to do with the macro and investment cycles. So I think consistent with the comments Robyn made at the Analyst Meeting. Look, it's our intent to really focus on how we can run this company in a way that we're able to grow faster than the addressable markets. And I think with the things we've done from an innovation standpoint, from a product standpoint, when it comes to routing, I think we're very well-positioned, certainly with switching and what we've done in QFabric, I think we've continued to take share, and we're well-positioned going forward and Bob's comments on security are consistent with the view that we've got a strong value proposition in Service Provider, and we've been taking actions over this last year to strengthen our hand in Enterprise. I feel like those are all the right set of things for us to be doing."

Our public sector team is absolutely fabulous and they're continuing to drive market share wins in the public sector in the areas that we focus on, particularly in the U.S. area.

I don't have specific numbers, I apologize on that, but the way I would characterize an answer to your question was this quarter was much more about the full QFabric systems, where in prior quarters, I think there was a lot of groundwork laid for QFabric nodes that are now being connected together into the full data center solution."

I'll first comment then I'll hand over to Stefan. Look, the engineering work that we do and the innovation we drive is intended to continue to reduce the cost per bit of traffic carried through new innovation and technology in the silicon, in the systems, in the way that comes together with the software. So that's been true for the last 10 or 20 years, as we focused on continuing to innovate and drive down the cost per bit of traffic carried. The second part of your question then is, does that create value proposition for customers? I believe the answer is yes. And then certainly the third part is, if traffic -- if networks are -- if traffic isn't growing as rapidly and networks aren't running as hot, does that have implications in terms of the timing of investments? And certainly every network is different but it would have difference in timing. Customers are going to look to make -- to put their capital where it can make the most impact for them in their business and sometimes that's in the core, when the core gets running too hot. Sometimes that's in the edge. And as Stefan commented earlier on the edge of the network, it's not just about cost per bit carried but it's new services and the way they're monetizing those new services with their customers. So there's a variety of ways that we have to add value to our customers. So Stefan you want to add to that?"

So you how to really invest in the silicon, in the systems to keep up with that growth of traffic. And our customers always push us to build bigger and bigger systems to address this problem. In terms of how they run their networks, as Kevin mentioned, they upgrade their networks for multiple reasons in terms of how hot they run it, where they put capabilities in the network and they'll make those different trade-offs.

You used the word sense of urgency, do we see some certain of urgency on the spending pattern in service providers? I wouldn't characterize it as a sense of urgency. What I would characterize we are seeing is a very disciplined planning approach that is creating new projects and new need to do upgrades on networks. It's not a sense of urgency to react to adding capacity, but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and discipline in the planning and that planning results in very clear projects with very clear business objectives that customers are trying to achieve. And I feel like if I look over the last 6 months, I think we've secured a number of wins and commitments from these customers where we've competed for these projects, and we've been awarded these projects. Some of these projects have kicked off, some are going to kick off in 2013. But I think that is an indicator that there is clearly value in the investments that they're looking to make, those investments are aligned with key business outcomes they're looking to drive. And the technology footprint that we have and innovation we've delivered is aligning with their business need. I think that, combined with the product cycle that we're in, having strength with the T4000, PTX and the core routing footprint, strength in the Edge with what we've done with MX and expanding that systems platform along with the new software services that Bob highlighted, and then moving us even forward into the access layer, I think that makes us a more competitive, more relevant player that has a fuller portfolio to solve these problems.
