The fourth quarter capped the year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board direct degree structuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our authentication service business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign that we believe is better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. 
As stewards of critical elements of Internet Infrastructure both what we do and how we do it importantly for secure and reliable operation of our global Internet, by which millions of people worldwide depend.
In 2011, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing a return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 15.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.
On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the reps in building purchase, potential financing fee scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We've entered this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. Security and stability are paramount to the way we run our business and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activities successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1.125 billion in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash of investing needs of the business and considered the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under 1 roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the rebuilding. 
Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interview and process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.
As we look towards 2012, 1 important area of focus is our .com renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the process.
I'll comment now on our fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names in the domain name base and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed.  The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
Looking at our NIA business, the team you perform very well and exceeded our full year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place and the expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. 
As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry Services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teeming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. 
By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for the gTLD succeeding. While the revenues not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already completing successfully for the back and service provider. This says a lot of other quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. 
Number four, we wanted it to invest in a grow the NIA business; number five continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.
We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. 
Following on to Jim's comments on our cash division, the total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility, as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. Invested cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.
Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow; then I will discuss 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6 million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66 million increase year-over-year, up 10%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9%, compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.
Net income and EPS -- non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense within Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains reasonable estimate. And 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.
Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefit and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. 
Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia headquarters building on November 15, 2011, for $118 million. 
To reiterate, we saw solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect the 2012 guidance, revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.
Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiency in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

There was some minor issues is that we mentioned in the contract. So they can look back at .net, when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been 1 change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1 of 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment. That then follows of course formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors and .com of course being a little different from .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned, there might in a prepared remarks, there is a timetable of the process. There's been engagement activities and our last spoke to you and we're please with that progress.

We provide them with information, we provide them with data, reports, analysis from the zone that help them manage their business better, and hopefully maximize the registration that they perform. We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in a sense that it plays to our strength. The IDN or the DDoS Mitigation service of course as a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed work where we couldn't buy off the shelf solution. And now we productized some of them. And manage DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that the customers. So all of those thanks you might consider value-added services, certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of these intelligence information, it comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added service. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research, and we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there.

Number one is that we're focusing on structuring it to scale for growth. So and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investments. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak. We want to make sure that it's going to scale out, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash and I think essentially our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investment in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to deleverage our core strength. VeriSign I think most of you understand is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed work that's actually unique. I think that something that's not well understood and in the future are going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by our high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those our investments that we have to make here. We have to make it not by it, because nobody doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments, and that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins."

The fourth quarter capped the year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign.

The fourth quarter capped the year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board-directed restructuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our authentication services business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign as we believe it's better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. 
As stewards of critical elements of Internet Infrastructure, both what we do and how we do it are important for the secured and reliable operation of the global Internet, by which billions of people worldwide depend.
In 2011, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing a return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 16.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.
On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the rest of the building purchased, potential financing fee scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We've entered this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach, and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. 
Security and stability are paramount for the way we run our business and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activities successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1.125 billion in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under 1 roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the new building. 
Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interviewing process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.
As we look towards 2012, 1 important area of focus is the .com agreement renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the progress.
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus, making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed. 
The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
Looking at our NIA business, the team performed very well and exceeded our full-year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place, and we expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. 
As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teeming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. 
By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for new gTLD succeeding. While the revenue is not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already competing successfully as the backend service provider. This says a lot about the quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. 
Number four, we want to continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; number five, continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value-added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.
We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. 
Following on to Jim's comments on our cash position. The total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. Especially, cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.
Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss 2012 full-year guidance.
Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6-million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66-million increase year-over-year, up 10%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9% compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.
Net income and EPS -- non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense booked in Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.
Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefits and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia headquarters building on November 15, 2011 for $118 million. 
To reiterate, we saw a solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance, revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.
Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiency in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

In general, concerning NIA, we now have the sales force hired where we want to be there.

I guess the material events that would certainly be disclosed, of course, would be the -- if you follow the .net process, as I'm sure most of you probably did, there was some point at which we came together with ICANN, agreed on the form of renewal. There was some minor issues, as we mentioned, in the contract. So if you could look back at .net when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been 1 change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1, 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment, that then follows, of course, formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors. And .com, of course, being a little different than .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date, which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is a timetable in the process. There's been engagement and activities since I last spoke to you, and we're pleased with that progress.

We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in a sense, but it plays to our strength. The IDN or our DDoS Mitigation service, of course, is a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed network where we couldn't buy off the shelf solution, and now we've productized some of those. And managed DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that to customers. So all of those things you might consider value-added services. Certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of these threat intelligence information that comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added services. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research. We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We are seeing opportunities. And these are fundamental new value-added services that would complement and fit well with our current DNS lookup services. So until we're ready to talk about those, we can't say more. But that is the focus of our research efforts."

So in the case of NIA in particular, I mentioned that we're doing a couple of things with NIA. Number one is that we're focusing on structuring it to scale for growth. So -- and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investment. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak, we want to make sure that it's going to scale well, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think, will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good, scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash, and I think essentially, our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investments in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to do, leverage is our core strength. VeriSign, I think most of you understand, is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed network that's actually unique. I think that's something that's not well understood. And in the future, we're going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by a high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those are investments that we have to make here. We have to make that, not buy it, because nobody is doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments. And that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins."

The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign.

The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board-directed restructuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our Authentication Services business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign that we believe is better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. 
As stewards of critical elements of Internet infrastructure, both what we do and how we do it are important for the secure and reliable operation of the global Internet, upon which billions of people worldwide depend.
In 2011, we continued to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing the return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 16.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.
On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the rest of the building purchased, potential financing scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We mentioned this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach, and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. 
Security and stability are paramount for the way we run our business, and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activity successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1,125,000,000 in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under one roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the new building. 
Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interviewing process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.
As we look towards 2012, one important area of focus is the .com agreement renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the progress.
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed. 
The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
Looking at our NIA business. The team performed very well and exceeded our full year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place, and we expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. 
As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teaming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. 
By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for new gTLD succeeding. While the revenue is not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already competing successfully as the backend service provider. This says a lot about the quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. 
Number four, we want to continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; number five, continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value-added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.
We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. 
Following on to Jim's comments on our cash position. The total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. In fact, the [ph] cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.
Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6 million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66 million increase year-over-year, up 10%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9% compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.
Net income and EPS.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense booked in Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.
With respect to taxes. We think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.
Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefits and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia, headquarters building on November 15, 2011 for $118 million. 
To reiterate, we saw solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance.  Revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.
Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

So if you could look back at .net when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been one change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1, 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment, that then follows, of course, formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors. And .com, of course, being a little different than .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date, which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is a timetable and a process. There's been engagement and activity since I last spoke to you, and we're pleased with that progress. So I think that's what we can say to you right now, but that's an overview of the process itself. And I think those are the events you can expect to see being disclosed certainly by VeriSign, but also information that'll appear on, in particular, the contract for public comment on ICANN's website."

I guess the obvious area is, first of all, there are several categories of value-added services. First of all, Pat's group is continually developing value-added services for the registrar channel to help them manage their business. We provide them with information, we provide them with data, reports, analyses from the zone that help them manage their business better and hopefully maximize the registrations that they perform. We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in the sense that it plays to our strength. The IDN or our DDoS Mitigation service, of course, is a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed network where we couldn't buy off the shelf solutions, and now we've productized some of those. And managed DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that to customers. So all of those things you might consider value-added services. Certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of the threat intelligence information that comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added services. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research. We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We are seeing opportunities. And these are fundamental new value-added services that would complement and fit well with our current DNS lookup services. So until we're ready to talk about those, we can't say more. But that is the focus of our research efforts."

So in the case of NIA in particular, I mentioned that we're doing a couple of things with NIA. Number one is that we're focusing on structuring it to scale for growth. So -- and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investment. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak, we want to make sure that it's going to scale well, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think, will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good, scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash, and I think you'll -- essentially, our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investments in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to do leverages our core strengths. VeriSign, I think most of you understand, is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed network that's actually unique. I think that's something that's not well understood that in the future we're going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by a high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those are investments that we have to make here. We have to make that, not buy it, because nobody's doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments. And that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins."

36216,145497131,211868,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign.

The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board-directed restructuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our Authentication Services business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign that we believe is better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. 
As stewards of critical elements of Internet infrastructure, both what we do and how we do it are important for the secure and reliable operation of the global Internet, upon which billions of people worldwide depend.
In 2011, we continued to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing the return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 16.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.
On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the rest of the building purchased, potential financing scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We mentioned this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach, and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. 
Security and stability are paramount for the way we run our business, and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activity successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1,125,000,000 in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under one roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the new building. 
Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interviewing process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.
As we look towards 2012, one important area of focus is the .com agreement renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the progress.
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed. 
The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.
Looking at our NIA business. The team performed very well and exceeded our full year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place, and we expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. 
As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teaming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. 
By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for new gTLD succeeding. While the revenue is not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already competing successfully as the backend service provider. This says a lot about the quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. 
Number four, we want to continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; number five, continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value-added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.
We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. 
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. 
Following on to Jim's comments on our cash position. The total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. In fact, the [ph] cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.
Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6 million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66 million increase year-over-year, up 10%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9% compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.
Net income and EPS.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense booked in Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.
With respect to taxes. We think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. 
Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.
Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefits and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia, headquarters building on November 15, 2011 for $118 million. 
To reiterate, we saw solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance.  Revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.
Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

Remember, we've gone from over 5,000 employees to roughly 1,000. Actually, we ended 2011 at 1,009 employees. So the process of discovering processes here at VeriSign that haven't caught up with the new VeriSign yet, I think, will probably continue for a while.

I guess the material events that would certainly be disclosed, of course, would be the -- if you follow the .net process, as I'm sure most of you probably did, there was some point at which we came together with ICANN, agreed on the form of renewal. There were some minor issues, as we mentioned, in the contract. So if you could look back at .net when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been one change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1, 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment, that then follows, of course, formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors. And .com, of course, being a little different than .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date, which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is a timetable and a process. There's been engagement and activity since I last spoke to you, and we're pleased with that progress. So I think that's what we can say to you right now, but that's an overview of the process itself.

We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in the sense that it plays to our strength. The IDN or our DDoS Mitigation service, of course, is a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed network where we couldn't buy off the shelf solutions, and now we've productized some of those. And managed DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that to customers. So all of those things you might consider value-added services. Certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of the threat intelligence information that comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added services. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research. We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We are seeing opportunities.

So -- and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investment. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak, we want to make sure that it's going to scale well, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think, will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good, scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash, and I think you'll -- essentially, our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investments in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to do leverages our core strengths. VeriSign, I think most of you understand, is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed network that's actually unique. I think that's something that's not well understood that in the future we're going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by a high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those are investments that we have to make here. We have to make that, not buy it, because nobody's doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments. And that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins."

The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. And we are pleased with the results. In naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. 
In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We are also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining our share repurchase authorization program which have no expiration. We continued to evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.
While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more detail about the share count and this impact during his comments.
On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com registry agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com registry agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registration agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign apply directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are of .com and .net. Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide backend Registry Services. it is still early in the process to determine what impact of these applications will have on our revenue.
Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expected that announcement in May.
Also as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap, and has been CFO of 3 public base. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.
Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his services as Interim CFO since last September.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.
Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strengths was driven by 2 favorable factors. First, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name Secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days at the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.
We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continue to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.
Thanks for your attention and I'll now turn the call over to John."

During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million, and non-GAAP operating margin",584,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. 
Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. 
Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.
Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. We saw solid performance in the first quarter, we have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 aggregate non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on indications of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business and in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. I'll turn the call back to Jim."

The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. 
In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization program, which have no expiration. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more details on the share count and its impact during his comments.
On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com Registry Agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registry agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign applied directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are transliterations of .com and .net. 
Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide back-end registry services. It is still early in the process to determine what impact these applications will have on our revenue.
Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expect that announcement in May.
Also, as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap and has been CFO of 3 public companies. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.
Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his service as Interim CFO since last September.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter.
In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period 1 year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.
Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strength was driven by 2 favorable factors: first, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name monetization; secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.
We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continuing to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. 
Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. 
Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. 
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter, compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.
Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. 
We saw solid performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. 
In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization program, which have no expiration. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more details on the share count and its impact during his comments.
On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com Registry Agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registry agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign applied directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are transliterations of .com and .net. 
Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide back-end registry services. It is still early in the process to determine what impact these applications will have on our revenue.
Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expect that announcement in May.
Also, as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap and has been CFO of 3 public companies. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.
Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his service as Interim CFO since last September.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter.
In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period 1 year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.
Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strength was driven by 2 favorable factors: first, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name monetization; secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.
We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continuing to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. 
Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. 
Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. 
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter, compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.
Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. 
We saw solid performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. 
In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. 
During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization program, which have no expiration. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more details on the share count and its impact during his comments.
On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com Registry Agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registry agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign applied directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are transliterations of .com and .net. 
Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide back-end registry services. It is still early in the process to determine what impact these applications will have on our revenue.
Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expect that announcement in May.
Also, as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap and has been CFO of 3 public companies. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.
Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his service as Interim CFO since last September.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter.
In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period 1 year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.
Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strength was driven by 2 favorable factors: first, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name monetization; secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.
We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continuing to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John."

As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. 
Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. 
Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. 
With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter, compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.
Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. 
We saw solid performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. 
I will now turn the call back to Jim."

The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we processed 8.4 million new registrations in Q2, a the second quarter record, while adding 1.81 million net names, finishing the quarter with 118.5 million names in the domain name base. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.9 million shares for $76 million. Thus far, in 2012, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares or about $144 million, and we have approximately $687 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
On June 23, 2012, ICANN approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement to service the operator of the .com registry for the term commencing on December 1, 2012, through November 30, 2018. As you may know, the .com renewal agreement terms, including the pricing provisions, are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights. 
the U.S. Department of Commerce, under an agreement called the Cooperative Agreement, is now reviewing the renewal of the .com registry agreement. We expect their approval on the renewal of the .com agreement by November 30. 
During the month of July, we marked 15 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com and .net infrastructure. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to recognize the efforts of our engineering and operations team for meeting this milestone. We continue to meet protecting our DNS infrastructure a priority while continuing to meet and exceed requirements of our service-level agreements. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 103.7 million names, while .net equaled 14.8 million names. The total base of registered names in common net was approximately 118.5 million at the end of June. This represents increases of 7.8% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the second quarter, we added 1.81 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.4 million new registrations, or a 4.2% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago.
The first quarter of 2012 renewal rate was 73.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares with 73.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2011. 
While Q2 was our second strongest quarter on record for new registrations, our net names added to the domain name base was at the low end of our guidance, primarily driven by what appears to be a softer than expected preliminary Q2 renewal rate. Our first time renewal rate was the main driver of the decrease in the preliminary second quarter renewal rates. First renewal rates are driven by many factors, and 2 factors had incremental impacts in the second quarter. 
First, search engine adjustments made over the past several months affected the economics, which drove the domain monetization rates in the first half of 2012. While monetization rates have increased for better performing sites, lower performing sites did not seem to be benefiting. We believe that some of these first-time renewing, lower performing sites did not renew during the quarter as a result of these changes, leading to the lower renewal rate. We have seen these search engine changes in the past and the resulting impacts on first time renewing names and our overall renewal rate. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted within several months. 
Secondly, we also believe that some additional promotional activity by registrars during the middle of 2011 led to a lower first time renewal rate this year. We expect the third quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.6 million and 1.9 million names reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Also, please note that starting tonight, we will make available a summary of the number of active domain names registered in the .com and .net registries and the number of the .com and .net domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain file. This information will be available from links on our corporate and Investor Relations website, which will also include definitions and explanations of the data. This additional information will continue to increase transparency into the overall size of common net zones as well as increase the frequency of the summary level information is available. 
Our NIA business continues to exhibit steady year-over-year bookings growth. We are focusing our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning that expenses with revenue. Now, let me turn over the call to our CFO, George Kilguss."

I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year ago levels and 4% sequentially. Of n",1047,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year ago levels and 4% sequentially. Of note, during the second quarter, revenue included an out-of-period adjustment that reduced revenue by reclassifying approximately $1.8 million from previously recognized revenue back into deferred revenue. Without this onetime reclassification, revenue would have approached $216 million in the quarter. 
During the quarter, the company also delivered GAAP operating income of $107 million, up 30% from $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 50%, up from 43% on the comparable period a year ago, which was a result of expenses remaining relatively flat from year ago levels. GAAP net income totaled $68 million compared to a GAAP net loss of $11 million a year earlier. 
As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of June 30, 2012, the company maintained total asset of $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of this $1.4 billion total, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities were $2 billion as of the second quarter, up slightly from $1.9 billion at year end. Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstands drawn under our $200 million credit facility and the $598 million present value of our $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accretive onto our balance sheet to its $1.25 billion face value over its 25-year remaining term. 
Let me now recap our performance for the second quarter for our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $214 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign operations. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic sourced revenue with which grew 11.6% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $804 million, a $75 million increase from year end and a $90 million increase in the second quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $8.5 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million and was flat sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter continued to expand and totaled 54% compared to 51.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to keep expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2011 and $0.42 last quarter.
Now I would like to update you on our taxes. As mentioned earlier, our international markets are growing slightly faster than our domestic markets. As a result, the proportion of income being generated overseas is also increasing. Our foreign income is taxed at a lower marginal rate than our domestic income that we expect to see an improvement in our blended tax rate over time. Accordingly, we believe a more reasonable estimate of our non-GAAP tax rate would be 28% going forward, down from our previous estimate of 30%. We expect to use a 28% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results. 
In 2012, we now expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 164 million shares in the second quarter compared to 163 million shares in the first quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 5.6 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.1 million shares from Q1. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q1 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.9 million shares repurchased during the current quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, up from $110 million in Q1 of this year and up compared to $13 million from the same quarter last year, which included a $100 million contingent interest payment to bondholders. Free cash flow was $130 million for the second quarter of 2012, including $8 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $880 million, representing an annual growth rate of between 13% and 14%. We previously gave a range of $870 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be at least 55%. We previously give a lower range of 52% to 54% on our last call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, again, with a $38 million estimate given on our last call. 
And finally, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% and 8% of revenue. We gave a 7% to 10% range on the last call. 
Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to experience solid performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And before opening the call to your questions, I would like to share with you how we're thinking about the business across the 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 years are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. First, with protect the business by providing unparalleled Registry Services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the Internet Infrastructure which we operate. We'll also continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement. 
Second, in addition to the organic growth of our Naming business, we see new gTLDs in our NIA business as adjacent potential growth opportunities. 
Third, we continue to focus on innovating and value creation through new services and we can build around with the meaning system. And forth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective, we seek to run the business efficiently and effectively through managing costs and continued margin improvement. We believe that delivering on these 4 areas with a right balance should provide unparalleled performance for our customers and create value for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

We think there were 2 main things that drove the slight reduction in the renewal rates. First of all, we mentioned the promotion by a large registrar that was very aggressive and led to an unusually larger number of first-time renewing rate names, which I think coupled with the changes in the search algorithm, were the primary contributors to the reduced renewal rate. The monetization community out there has a history, and this has happened before, it happened as you recall in 2008, and they have a history of rebounding. They generally sort of adapted to the changes after a quarter or 2 at most. So we expect that to happen in this case, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we gave."

But I can give you maybe a few thoughts about I have developed over the past 2 months. And the leverage side, and being a former lender in earlier in my career, I tend to look at the total debt obligations outstanding the company has compared to it's EBITDA as a measure of leverage. And when I look at VeriSign, we have, as you know, a $1.25 billion convertible bond plus about $200 million revolving credit facility, so somewhere between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion of total outstanding debt and commitments today. If you were to simply annualize our second quarter EBITDA and then compare that to the debt level that we have, you probably get a ratio of somewhere between 2.6 or 2.8x. And so the real question we need to answer as a firm over the coming quarters is what is the appropriate leverage ratio for the business. We clearly have some debt capacity, but it's really all a matter of what is the appropriate risk profile for the business. So we'll have to do some more work to do on that. but that's really the framework that I'm thinking about the debt that we have on the books and unfolds around our capital structure."

We do have the benefit of the long history of operating expense, a long reliability record and plus the fact that we just don't run, common net, we run under other domains as well. We run .tv and .name and we have a structure that lends itself to supporting this type of multiple domain structure. I think we're very carefully prepared and positioned and more experienced than that I think we have a pretty good the into this and I think George is comment in accurate and first of all, we have to wait and see which applications are actually get through and what actual number is. But there was a lot of thought and a lot of process and a lot of careful consideration given to arriving at the 220 number. And so, we feel comfortable that we're prepared and our structure is we designed to support multiple domains. I think we're in good shape."

My sense of it is now without any specific data to give you at this moment is for the loaded basis of those on is obviously much larger and I guess would be that advertising names are probably larger than they were at the time.

So my sense is the safety in numbers period work here and that the zone is larger and even though the advertising names may be larger, this rather rare change in search engine algorithms, 2008 now 2012, actually had a smaller impact than it did back then. And I'm sure you're remember in 2008, the impact was quite significant. Here we are with a larger zone and a larger numbers of advertising names, and yet the impact was rather modest, literally 2/10 of a percent compared to the same period a year or 3/10 of a percent 2010 and 2011.

The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results.

The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we processed 8.4 million new registrations in Q2, a second quarter record, while adding 1.81 million net names, finishing the quarter with 118.5 million names in the domain name base. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.9 million shares for $76 million. Thus far, in 2012, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares or about $144 million, and we have approximately $687 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
On June 23, 2012, ICANN approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement to service the operator of the .com registry for the term commencing on December 1, 2012, through November 30, 2018. As you may know, the .com renewal agreement terms, including the pricing provisions, are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce, under an agreement called the Cooperative Agreement, is now reviewing the renewal of the .com registry agreement. We expect their approval on the renewal of the .com agreement by November 30. 
During the month of July, we marked 15 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com and .net zone infrastructure. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to recognize the efforts of our engineering and operation teams for meeting this milestone. We continue to make protecting our DNS infrastructure a priority, while continuing to meet and exceed requirements of our service-level agreements. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 103.7 million names, while .net equaled 14.8 million names. The total base of registered names in common net was approximately 118.5 million at the end of June. This represents increases of 7.8% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the second quarter, we added 1.81 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.4 million new registrations or a 4.2% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago.
The first quarter of 2012 renewal rate was 73.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2011. 
While Q2 is our second strongest quarter on record for new registrations, our net names added to the domain name base was at the low end of our guidance, primarily driven by what appears to be a softer-than-expected preliminary Q2 renewal rate. Our first time renewal rate was the main driver of the decrease in the preliminary second quarter renewal rate. First time renewal rates are driven by many factors, and 2 factors had incremental impacts in the second quarter. 
First, search engine adjustments made over the past several months affected the economics, which drove domain monetization rates in the first half of 2012. While monetization rates have increased for better performing sites, lower performing sites do not seem to be benefiting. We believe that some of this first time renewing, lower performing sites did not renew during the quarter as a result of these changes, leading to the lower renewal rate. We have seen these search engine changes in the past and the resulting impacts on first time renewing names and our overall renewal rate. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted within several months. 
Secondly, we also believe that some additional promotional activity by registrars during the middle of 2011 led to a lower first time renewal rate this year. We expect the third quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.6 million and 1.9 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Also, please note that starting tonight, we will make available a summary of the number of active domain names registered in the .com and net registries and the number of.com and .net domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain zone file.

Now, let me turn over the call to our CFO, George Kilguss."
36216,212758926,332281,"VeriSign, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of no",1044,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of note, during the second quarter, revenue included an out-of-period adjustment that reduced revenue by reclassifying approximately $1.8 million from previously recognized revenue back into deferred revenue. Without this onetime reclassification, revenue would have approached $216 million in the quarter. 
During the quarter, the company also delivered GAAP operating income of $107 million, up 30% from $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 50%, up from 43% from the comparable period a year ago, which was a result of expenses remaining relatively flat from year-ago levels. GAAP net income totaled $68 million compared to a GAAP net loss of $11 million a year earlier. 
As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of June 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of this $1.4 billion total, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities were $2 billion as of the second quarter, up slightly from $1.9 billion at year end. Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million credit facility and the $598 million present value of our $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet to its $1.25 billion face value over its 25-year remaining term. 
Let me now recap our performance for the second quarter for our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow, then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $214 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign operations. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 11.6% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $804 million, a $75 million increase from year end and $90 million increase from the second quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $8.5 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million and was flat sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter continued to expand and totaled 54% compared to 51.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to keep expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2011 and $0.42 last quarter.
Now I would like to update you on our taxes. As mentioned earlier, our international markets are growing slightly faster than our domestic markets. As a result, the proportion of income being generated overseas is also increasing. Our foreign income is taxed at a lower marginal rate than our domestic income that we expect to see an improvement in our blended tax rate over time. Accordingly, we believe a more reasonable estimate of our non-GAAP tax rate would be 28% going forward, down from our previous estimate of 30%. We expect to use a 28% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results. 
In 2012, we now expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 164 million shares in the second quarter compared to 163 million shares in the first quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 5.6 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.1 million shares from Q1. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q1 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.9 million shares repurchased during the current quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, up from $110 million in Q1 of this year and up compared to $13 million from the same quarter last year, which included a $100 million contingent interest payment to convertible bondholders. Free cash flow was $130 million for the second quarter of 2012, including $8 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $880 million, representing an annual growth rate of between 13% and 14%. We previously gave a range of $870 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be at least 55%. We previously gave a lower range of 52% to 54% on our last call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012 compared with the $38 million estimate given on our last call. 
And finally, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% and 8% of revenue. We gave a 7% to 10% range on the last call. 
Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to experience solid performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And before opening the call to your questions, I would like to share with you how we're thinking about the business across the 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. First, we'll protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure which we operate. We'll also continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement. 
Second, in addition to the organic growth of our Naming business, we see new gTLDs in our NIA business as adjacent potential growth opportunities. 
Third, we continue to focus on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the domain name system. 
And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We seek to run the business efficiently and effectively through managing costs and continued margin improvement. 
We believe that delivering on these 4 areas with a right balance should provide unparalleled performance for our customers and create value for our shareholders. 
We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

We think there were 2 main things that drove the slight reduction in the renewal rate. First of all, we mentioned that promotion by a large registrar that was very aggressive and led to an unusually larger number of first time renewing names, which I think, coupled with the changes in the search algorithm were the primary contributors to the reduced renewal rate. The monetization community out there has a history. This has happened before. It happened, as you recall, in 2008, and they have a history of rebounding. They generally sort of adapted the changes after 1 quarter or 2 at most. So we expect that to happen in this case, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we gave."

You've seen, we've managed that expense pretty well.

So I would start by saying that, look, I've been in the chair for about 2 months, so we'll continue to take a look and evaluate our capital structure, and this will be something we'll be spending some more time on over the next few quarters. But I can give you maybe a few thoughts that I have developed over the past 2 months. On the leverage side, and being a former lender earlier in my career, I tend to look at the total debt obligations outstanding the company has compared to its EBITDA as a measure of leverage. And when I look at VeriSign, we have, as you know, a $1.25 billion convertible bond plus about $200 million revolving credit facility, so somewhere between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion of total outstanding debt and commitments today. If you were to simply annualize our second quarter EBITDA and then compare that to the debt level that we have, you probably get a ratio of somewhere between 2.6 or 2.8x. And so the real question we need to answer, as a firm, over the coming quarters is, what is the appropriate leverage ratio for the business. We clearly have some debt capacity, but it's really all a matter of what is the appropriate risk profile for the business. So we'll have to do some more work to do on that, but that's really the current framework that I'm thinking about the debt that we have on the books and some thoughts around our capital structure."

We do have the benefit of a long history of operating experience, a long reliability record and plus the fact that we just don't run common net, we run under other domains as well. We run .tv and .name and we have a structure that lends itself to supporting this type of multiple domain structure. So I think we're very carefully prepared and positioned and more experienced than -- I think we have a pretty good view into this, so I think George's comments were accurate. And that first of all, we have to wait and see which applications actually get through and what the actual number is.

The answer to your question is that we don't really think about it as any single or some number of barriers to increasing margins. We think of it as a balance across those 4 areas. Job one is to protect the business. We have growth areas we've committed investments in. That's all baked into our guidance on margins. We think that we have intellectual capital and intellectual property that we can exploit in innovation, which doesn't require great investment, no great capital vestment.

Back then, we did talk about what we believe to be the advertising makeup of the base. My sense of it is now without any specific data to give you at this moment is, first of all, the basis of those element is obviously much larger. I guess would be that the advertising names are probably larger than they were at the time. However, if you look at the renewal rate, at 72.9 over the last 2 quarters, just looking back, I'm sorry, in the 2 periods of 2010 and 2011, the Q2 periods, it differs only by -- and we did not have, by the way, any search engine changes in those periods. You're only talking about, respectively, 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point difference in the renewal rate. So my sense is that the safety in numbers, periods at work here and that the zone is larger and even though the number of advertising names may be larger, this rather rare change in search engine algorithms, 2008, now 2012, actually had a smaller impact than it did back then. I'm sure you're remember in 2008, the impact was quite significant. Here we are with a larger zone and a larger number of advertising names and yet the impact was rather modest, literally 0.2% compared to the same period a year ago or 0.3% 2010 and 2011.

The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we processed 8.4 million new registrations in Q2, a second quarter record, while adding 1.81 million net names, finishing the quarter with 118.5 million names in the domain name base. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.9 million shares for $76 million. Thus far, in 2012, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares or about $144 million, and we have approximately $687 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
On June 23, 2012, ICANN approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement to service the operator of the .com registry for the term commencing on December 1, 2012, through November 30, 2018. As you may know, the .com renewal agreement terms, including the pricing provisions, are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce, under an agreement called the Cooperative Agreement, is now reviewing the renewal of the .com registry agreement. We expect their approval on the renewal of the .com agreement by November 30. 
During the month of July, we marked 15 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com and .net zone infrastructure. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to recognize the efforts of our engineering and operation teams for meeting this milestone. We continue to make protecting our DNS infrastructure a priority, while continuing to meet and exceed requirements of our service-level agreements. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 103.7 million names, while .net equaled 14.8 million names. The total base of registered names in common net was approximately 118.5 million at the end of June. This represents increases of 7.8% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the second quarter, we added 1.81 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.4 million new registrations or a 4.2% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago.
The first quarter of 2012 renewal rate was 73.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2011. 
While Q2 is our second strongest quarter on record for new registrations, our net names added to the domain name base was at the low end of our guidance, primarily driven by what appears to be a softer-than-expected preliminary Q2 renewal rate. Our first time renewal rate was the main driver of the decrease in the preliminary second quarter renewal rate. First time renewal rates are driven by many factors, and 2 factors had incremental impacts in the second quarter. 
First, search engine adjustments made over the past several months affected the economics, which drove domain monetization rates in the first half of 2012. While monetization rates have increased for better performing sites, lower performing sites do not seem to be benefiting. We believe that some of these first time renewing, lower performing sites did not renew during the quarter as a result of these changes, leading to the lower renewal rate. We have seen these search engine changes in the past and the resulting impacts on first time renewing names and our overall renewal rate. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted within several months. 
Secondly, we also believe that some additional promotional activity by registrars during the middle of 2011 led to a lower first time renewal rate this year. We expect the third quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.6 million and 1.9 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. 
Also, please note that starting tonight, we will make available a summary of the number of active domain names registered in the .com and net registries and the number of .com and .net domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain zone file. This information will be available from links on our corporate and Investor Relations website, which will also include definitions and explanations of the data. This additional information will continue to increase transparency into the overall size of common net zones as well as increase the frequency that this summary level information is available. 
Our NIA business continues to exhibit steady year-over-year bookings growth. We are focusing our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. 
Now, let me turn over the call to our CFO, George Kilguss."

I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of no",1044,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of note, during the second quarter, revenue included an out-of-period adjustment that reduced revenue by reclassifying approximately $1.8 million from previously recognized revenue back into deferred revenue. Without this onetime reclassification, revenue would have approached $216 million in the quarter. 
During the quarter, the company also delivered GAAP operating income of $107 million, up 30% from $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 50%, up from 43% from the comparable period a year ago, which was a result of expenses remaining relatively flat from year-ago levels. GAAP net income totaled $68 million compared to a GAAP net loss of $11 million a year earlier. 
As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of June 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of this $1.4 billion total, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities were $2 billion as of the second quarter, up slightly from $1.9 billion at year end. Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million credit facility and the $598 million present value of our $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet to its $1.25 billion face value over its 25-year remaining term. 
Let me now recap our performance for the second quarter for our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow, then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $214 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign operations. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 11.6% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $804 million, a $75 million increase from year end and $90 million increase from the second quarter of 2011. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $8.5 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million and was flat sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter continued to expand and totaled 54% compared to 51.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to keep expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to improve our operating margin. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2011 and $0.42 last quarter.
Now I would like to update you on our taxes. As mentioned earlier, our international markets are growing slightly faster than our domestic markets. As a result, the proportion of income being generated overseas is also increasing. Our foreign income is taxed at a lower marginal rate than our domestic income that we expect to see an improvement in our blended tax rate over time. Accordingly, we believe a more reasonable estimate of our non-GAAP tax rate would be 28% going forward, down from our previous estimate of 30%. We expect to use a 28% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results. 
In 2012, we now expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 164 million shares in the second quarter compared to 163 million shares in the first quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 5.6 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.1 million shares from Q1. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q1 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.9 million shares repurchased during the current quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, up from $110 million in Q1 of this year and up compared to $13 million for the same quarter last year, which included a $100 million contingent interest payment to convertible bondholders. Free cash flow was $130 million for the second quarter of 2012, including $8 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $880 million, representing an annual growth rate of between 13% and 14%. We previously gave a range of $870 million to $890 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be at least 55%. We previously gave a lower range of 52% to 54% on our last call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012 compared with the $38 million estimate given on our last call. 
And finally, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% and 8% of revenue. We gave a 7% to 10% range on the last call. 
Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to experience solid performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And before opening the call to your questions, I would like to share with you how we're thinking about the business across the 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure which we operate. We'll also continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement. 
Second, in addition to the organic growth of our Naming business, we see new gTLDs in our NIA business as adjacent potential growth opportunities. 
Third, we continue to focus on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the domain name system. 
And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We seek to run the business efficiently and effectively through managing costs and continued margin improvement. 
We believe that delivering on these 4 areas with a right balance should provide unparalleled performance for our customers and create value for our shareholders.

We think there were 2 main things that drove the slight reduction in the renewal rate. First of all, we mentioned that promotion by a large registrar that was very aggressive and led to an unusually larger number of first time renewing names, which I think, coupled with the changes in the search algorithm were the primary contributors to the reduced renewal rate. The monetization community out there has a history. This has happened before. It happened, as you recall, in 2008, and they have a history of rebounding. They generally sort of adapted the changes after 1 quarter or 2 at most. So we expect that to happen in this case, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we gave."

So I would start by saying that, look, I've been in the chair for about 2 months, so we'll continue to take a look and evaluate our capital structure, and this will be something we'll be spending some more time on over the next few quarters. But I can give you maybe a few thoughts that I have developed over the past 2 months. On the leverage side, and being a former lender earlier in my career, I tend to look at the total debt obligations outstanding the company has compared to its EBITDA as a measure of leverage. And when I look at VeriSign, we have, as you know, a $1.25 billion convertible bond plus about $200 million revolving credit facility, so somewhere between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion of total outstanding debt and commitments today. If you were to simply annualize our second quarter EBITDA and then compare that to the debt level that we have, you probably get a ratio of somewhere between 2.6 or 2.8x. And so the real question we need to answer, as a firm, over the coming quarters is, what is the appropriate leverage ratio for the business. We clearly have some debt capacity, but it's really all a matter of what is the appropriate risk profile for the business. So we'll have to do some more work to do on that, but that's really the current framework that I'm thinking about the debt that we have on the books and some thoughts around our capital structure."

We do have the benefit of a long history of operating experience, a long reliability record and plus the fact that we just don't run common net, we run under other domains as well. We run .tv and .name and we have a structure that lends itself to supporting this type of multiple domain structure.

Job one is to protect the business. We have growth areas we've committed investments in. That's all baked into our guidance on margins. We think that we have intellectual capital and intellectual property that we can exploit in innovation, which doesn't require great investment, no great capital vestment.

Since these are first time renewals and they're trying to drive traffic to those types of pages, is there a similar type of analysis that you've done so we can get a sense as to maybe what portion of the base are first time renewals and what portion of those might be these types of advertising names that could get impacted?"

Back then, we did talk about what we believe to be the advertising makeup of the base. My sense of it is now without any specific data to give you at this moment is, first of all, the basis of those element is obviously much larger. I guess would be that the advertising names are probably larger than they were at the time. However, if you look at the renewal rate, at 72.9 over the last 2 quarters, just looking back, I'm sorry, in the 2 periods of 2010 and 2011, the Q2 periods, it differs only by -- and we did not have, by the way, any search engine changes in those periods. You're only talking about, respectively, 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point difference in the renewal rate. So my sense is that the safety in numbers, periods at work here and that the zone is larger and even though the number of advertising names may be larger, this rather rare change in search engine algorithms, 2008, now 2012, actually had a smaller impact than it did back then. I'm sure you're remember in 2008, the impact was quite significant. Here we are with a larger zone and a larger number of advertising names and yet the impact was rather modest, literally 0.2% compared to the same period a year ago or 0.3% 2010 and 2011. So that's the way we tend to think of it. The impact was very, very modest. I don't know if you want to add anything, Pat?"

As you have seen from the press release, we have some important news about the status of the renewal of the .com agreement. I'll begin with the news on the com renewal and then George and I will cover the key highlights for the quarter, and I will turn to your questions. 
By terms in an agreement with between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign called the Cooperative Agreement, we submitted our agreement with ICANN, to service the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry to the Commerce Department for its review on June 26, 2012. As a result of communications beginning in October 2012 with a Commerce Department, we learned that the Commerce Department was conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice. We believe this review, which we are participating in, may continue beyond November 30, 2012, in which case a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement will become effective. We want to emphasize that nothing has happened that changes the risk of our running .com. We expect to continue to be the registry operator of .com. Our record on the security and stability has been acknowledged by the Commerce Department. We are involved in discussions with the Commerce and Justice Departments as they review the pricing terms of the.com renewal agreement. These discussions are ongoing and could extend beyond November 30. We will work diligently with them through the review process. Because of our discussions on this matter, are ongoing I'm not going to more detail. We will, however, update you on the appropriate regarding new information. I'll now review the key highlights of the third quarter.
The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign and we continue to see benefits from our restructuring focus and discipline. In Naming, we processed 7.8 million new registrations in the third quarter while adding 1.37 million net names, finishing the quarter with 119.9 million names in the domain name base. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $77 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $221 million and we have approximately $610 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration.
We continue to collect the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. 
In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 105 million names, while.net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 119.9 million at the end of September. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.37 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 7.8 million new registrations, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago. 
In the second quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.3%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.
Net number of names added to the domain base during the third quarter were below our guidance, primarily driven by 2 factors. First, the continuing effects of changes in search we discussed during last quarter. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months continue to affect the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in our last earnings call, we have seen these search engine changes in the past, which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters. We have no way of knowing how long they'll be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment, but we are now experiencing the second quarter of these affects.
Secondly, we are seeing some signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, are also leading to softer international renewal rates. Given these 2 factors, we expect the fourth quarter net names added to the base to be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names. 
As discussed on the last call, we post updates on the zone on our website at least once per day. With this increased transparency, you'll be able to track how the zone is growing throughout the fourth quarter. 
Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to focus our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss."

For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $224 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $116 million, up 30% from $89 million in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 51.9% compared to 45.2% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter.
GAAP net income totaled $78 million compared to $59 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in the quarter on a GAAP basis. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities remained at approximately $2 billion as of the third quarter, up from $1.9 billion at year end. 
As you may have noticed, during the latter part of the third quarter, the stock price exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting them into common stock during the fourth quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures related embedded derivatives and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of September 30, 2012.
Total debt on the balance sheet was $703 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under the $200 million credit facility and the $603 million present value of the $1.2 billion in convertible debentures.
The convertible debentures continue to be accretive to our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2012 for full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $224 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago a month and slightly faster than our domestic sourced revenue, which grew 12.7% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $809 million, an $80 million increase from year end. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million and was down 1% sequentially.
G&A operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in legal and related expenses of $3.9 million due to efforts supporting the Department of Commerce review of our renewal of .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the legal advisor related to ICANN's new gTLD program. These increased expenses were expected as part of the .com renewal process and the new gTLD program, and were offset by lower sales and marketing expense in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter continued to expand and totaled 56.4% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising cost, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to benefit our operating margin.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $84 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.45 last quarter.
With respect to taxes, as stated in our last earnings call, starting from the third quarter, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 166.6 million shares in the third quarter compared to 164.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 9.2 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.6 million shares from the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q2 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter.
Operating cash flow was $122 million for the third quarter, down from $135 million in the second quarter of this year and up compared to $108 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $117 million for the third quarter of 2012, including $9 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to guidance, we now think revenues for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $875 million, representing an annual growth rate of about 13%. We gave a range of $870 million to $880 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 55%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% to 7% of revenue. We give a range of 6% to 8% on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, and we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as it was result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Our strategic framework is how we're thinking about the business across 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. 
First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled Registry Services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the infrastructure which we operate. As discussed earlier, we will continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards our goodwill of our .com agreement. 
Second, with respect to both, as you may have noticed, ICANN has given updates to its timeline in process for their new gTLD program. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net. 
Third, as evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the Domain Name System. 
And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas with the right balance, should provide unparalleled performance for our customers, businesses and consumers that rely on our critical infrastructure as well as creating value for our shareholders.

But I would say to you that as we say, as we mentioned earlier during the call, as I talked about it and as George talked about, it is to the the large in the efficiency that we see in the business I think are due to the fact that we've been running the business more efficiently. Recall of course that we've just completed a major 5-year restructuring going from over 5,000 employees to about 1,000, shedding numerous non-core businesses, having cash that is a result of proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses, a long-term 5-year divestiture program, and our focus on managing the business efficiently and on operating discipline and on being very focused. So I would say that I would think we've done a very good job over the last 5 years of optimizing the business, running it very efficiently, understanding where we are. 2011 was the first year that we really operated on a full year basis as sort of the new VeriSign, focused on 1 particular business, that being the Registry Services business. Prior to that, we were always something else. It wasn't until past the midpoint of 2010 that we actually completed the sale of the Authentication business. So we've just come off in 2011 and now in 2012, the first year and second year have actually being a focused Registry business and it take some time to adjust to that and as we've adjusted, we discovered efficiencies because we focus on it. We operate the business efficiently, we target efficient operations. Generally, the result of that is improving margins. So I would say that, that's a very important part of VeriSign's margin story and its efficient business."

Let me make a couple of comments to adjust that question and let George and it comment as appropriate year. First of all, you recall that back in 2009, that is really the first time that we saw a major change in search algorithms that targeted the monetization players who were essentially to exploit the search engine algorithm to get themselves placed higher in results so that they can drive traffic and monetize it themselves. We saw that over a period of time, after those changes, there was some recovery in the monetization community adapted to it. We saw in 2012 changes which affected Q2, which we discussed with you before. I think there is a more serious effort by the search engine algorithm players here to sort of cleanup search results and improve the quality, as Pat said, to drive some of the monetization community down further. So as we discussed in the last call the and penguin programs that Google utilized where they were targeting content farms, they were targeting keyword stuffers and now they're also targeting exact name matches, which typically are monetization names often. So for example, if you search for purple blue widgets, and purple blue widgets.com happens to be a registered domain, that in the past would've been likely to score very high in the search results. However, if the search engine algorithm is ticked to go out and consider other factors, the age of the domain, how many pages are on it, how fresh is some of the contents and given the score essentially, on how likely it is that it's truly quality content that the searcher might be interested in versus something that had been set up for monetization purposes, I think the search engine algorithms are essentially targeting that kind of traffic to get it out. You'll also recall that back in 2009, we said that roughly 9% of the zone as far as we could tell were so-called advertising names and we're not at a point right now to tell you exactly what that number is today. But I think there might be some developments where other domains have sort of other TLDs have targeted in a sense this monetization committee. And possibly, some of that some of those things may have been drawn away over the years and moved to other areas, which is in a sense, a good thing because the business of these changes while they are making a difference and I know you see that every day, we do too, of course. And while it may take longer to recover depending on how intense and how sustained these campaigns are, the fact is that there may be fewer of these names to work on in .com because of the move to other TLDs. LPAC watches this very closely and George does as well so I would like them to comment."

And they were offset by some lower spend in our sales and marketing. As you may have known, we had a transition in our leadership in the marketing area, and so we had some under spend in that area, at least in the third quarter. But we at least managed those costs and they offset one another in the quarter. So we again look for efficiencies, but for example, in the fourth quarter, which we talked about, we will have a change in the ICANN registration fees. Those will go on or variable basis from the fixed basis. So they go up to about $0.25 per name. So starting December 1, we'll see the fees paid to ICANN increase in cost of about $750,000 a month.

But it is a fact that you're seeing playing out in today's headlines everyday the kind of attacks against infrastructure, against targets for political or other reasons.

We don't -- we haven't done any planning that would have us in a vertical integration scenario as an operating business. Our focus is really security and stability first and quite frankly I think it might be awkward to actually be it doesn't registrar ourselves, its a very different business. And as you may know, we were at 1 point many years ago in that business, when we first bought Network Solutions in June of 2000, it was of course both a registry and registrar that it wasn't until a few years later and I believe it was around 2003 when we sold off the retail part of that business. And it was very different. So given the new sort of single focus that VeriSign is in right now, as a registry services provider, whose first mission is availability. We when you consider for example over the last 6 years that I major restructuring, through the last 6 years, through a major restructuring through the 2007, 2008, 2009 economic downturn, we've been able to maintain a record of security and stability. I'm sure a lot of you saw the just over the last few weeks, there were some major outages I won't mention the names, but a large registrar and a large web services company just over the last few weeks had extended outages. If that happened to .com, I think there'd be a lot more attention, there'd be a lot more people affected, there would be a lot more economic loss because I sort of like as a model focus on doing one thing, which is providing absolutely secure and stable infra- structure because it is just too much that depends on it here."

I'll begin with the news on the .com renewal and then George and I will cover the key highlights for the quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. 
By terms in an agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign called the Cooperative Agreement, we submitted our agreement with ICANN, to service the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry to the Commerce Department for its review on June 26, 2012. As a result of communications beginning in October 2012 with the Commerce Department, we learned that the Commerce Department was conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice. We believe this review, which we are participating in, may continue beyond November 30, 2012, in which case a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement would become effective. We want to emphasize that nothing has happened that changes the risk of our running .com. We expect to continue to be the registry operator of .com. Our record on the security and stability has been acknowledged by the Commerce Department. We are involved in discussions with the Commerce and Justice Departments as they review the pricing terms in the .com renewal agreement. These discussions are ongoing and could extend beyond November 30. We will work diligently with them through the review process. Because of our discussions on this matter are ongoing, I'm not going to go into more detail. We will, however, update you, when appropriate, regarding new information. I'll now review the key highlights of the third quarter.
The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign and we continue to see benefits from our restructuring focus and discipline. In Naming, we processed 7.8 million new registrations in the third quarter while adding 1.37 million net names, finishing the quarter with 119.9 million names in the domain name base. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $77 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $221 million and we have approximately $610 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration.
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 105 million names, while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 119.9 million at the end of September. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.37 million .net names to the domain name base and we processed 7.8 million new registrations, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago. 
In the second quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.3%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.
Net number of names added to the domain base during the third quarter were below our guidance, primarily driven by 2 factors. First, the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms we discussed during last quarter. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months continue to affect the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in our last earnings call, we have seen these search engine changes in the past, which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters. We have no way of knowing how long they'll be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment, but we are now experiencing the second quarter of these affects.
Secondly, we are seeing some signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, are also leading to softer international renewal rates. Given these 2 factors, we expect the fourth quarter .net names added to the base to be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names. 
As discussed on the last call, we post updates on the zone on our website at least once per day. With this increased transparency, you'll be able to track how the zone is growing throughout the fourth quarter. 
Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to focus our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss."

For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $224 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $116 million, up 30% from $89 million in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 51.9% compared to 45.2% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter.
GAAP net income totaled $78 million compared to $59 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in the quarter on a GAAP basis. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities remained at approximately $2 billion as of the third quarter, up from $1.9 billion at year end. 
As you may have noticed, during the latter part of the third quarter, the stock price exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting them into common stock during the fourth quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivatives and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of September 30, 2012.
Total debt on the balance sheet was $703 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under the $200 million credit facility and the $603 million present value of the $1.2 billion in convertible debentures.
The convertible debentures continue to be accretive onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $224 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic source revenue, which grew 12.7% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $809 million, an $80 million increase from year end. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million and was down 1% sequentially.
G&A operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in legal and related expenses of $3.9 million due to efforts supporting the Department of Commerce review of our renewal of .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the legal advice related to ICANN's new gTLD program. These increased expenses were expected as part of the .com renewal process and the new gTLD program, and were offset by lower sales and marketing expense in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter continued to expand and totaled 56.4% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising cost, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to benefit our operating margin.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $84 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.45 last quarter.
With respect to taxes, as stated on our last earnings call, starting from the third quarter, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 166.6 million shares in the third quarter compared to 164.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 9.2 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.6 million shares from the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q2 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter.
Operating cash flow was $122 million for the third quarter, down from $135 million in the second quarter of this year and up compared to $108 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $117 million for the third quarter of 2012, including $9 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to guidance, we now think revenues for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $875 million, representing an annual growth rate of about 13%. We gave a range of $870 million to $880 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 55%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% to 7% of revenue. We gave a range of 6% to 8% on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to give you a progress update on our execution against the strategic framework we shared with you during our last call. Our strategic framework is how we're thinking about the business across 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. 
First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the infrastructure which we operate. As discussed earlier, we will continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement. 
Second, with respect to growth, as you may have noticed, ICANN has given updates to its timeline in process for their new gTLD program. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net. 
Third, as evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the Domain Name System. 
And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas, with the right balance, should provide unparalleled performance for our customers, businesses and consumers that rely on our critical infrastructure as well as creating value for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

But I would say to you that as we say, as we mentioned earlier during the call, as I talked about it and as George talked about, it is, to  large extent, the efficiencies that we see in the business, I think, are due to the fact that we've been running the business more efficiently. Recall of course, that we've just completed a major 5-year restructuring going from over 5,000 employees to about 1,000, shedding numerous non-core businesses, having cash that is a result of proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses, a long-term 5-year divestiture program, and our focus on managing the business efficiently and on operating discipline and on being very focused. So I would say that I think we've done a very good job over the last 5 years of optimizing the business, running it very efficiently, understanding where we are. 2011 was the first year that we really operated on a full year basis as sort of the new VeriSign, focused on one particular business, that being the Registry Services business. Prior to that, we were always something else. It wasn't until past the midpoint of 2010 that we actually completed the sale of the Authentication business. So we've just come off in 2011 and now in 2012, the first year and second year have actually being a focused Registry business and it takes some time to adjust to that and as we've adjusted, we discovered efficiencies because we focus on it. We operate the business efficiently, we target efficient operations. Generally, the result of that is improving margins. So I would say that, that's a very important part of VeriSign's margin story and its efficient business."

Let me make a couple of comments to address that question then I'll let George and Pat comment as appropriate here. First of all, you recall that back in 2009, that was really the first time that we saw a major change in search algorithms that targeted the monetization players who were essentially trying to exploit the search engine algorithm to get themselves placed higher in results so that they can drive traffic and monetize it themselves. We saw that over a period of time, after those changes, there was some recovery and the monetization community adapted to it. We saw in 2012, changes which affected Q2, which we've discussed with you before. I think there is a more serious effort by the search engine algorithm players here to sort of clean up search results and improve the quality, as Pat said, to drive some of the monetization community down further. So we discussed in the last call, the Panda and Penguin programs, for example, that Google utilized where they were targeting content farms, they were targeting keyword stuffers and now, they're also targeting exact name matches, which typically are monetization names often. So for example, if you search for purple blue widgets, and purplebluewidgets.com happens to be a registered domain, that in the past, would've been likely to score very high in the search results. However, if the search engine algorithm is tweaked to go out and consider other factors, the age of the domain, how many pages are on it, how fresh is some of the contents and give it a score, essentially, on how likely it is that it's truly quality content that the searcher might be interested in versus something that had been set up for monetization purposes, I think the search engine algorithms are essentially targeting that kind of traffic to get it out. You'll also recall that back in 2009, we said that roughly 9% of the zone, as far as we could tell, were so-called advertising names. We're not at a point right now to tell you exactly what that number is today. But I think there might be some developments where other domains have sort of other TLDs have targeted in a sense, this monetization community and possibly, some of those names may have been drawn away over the years and moved to other areas, which is, in a sense, a good thing because it means that these changes, while they are making a difference and I know you see that every day, we do too, of course, and while it may take longer to recover depending on how intense and how sustained these campaigns are, the fact is that there may be fewer of these names to work on in .com because of the move to other TLDs. I know Pat watches this very, very closely and George does as well so I'll invite them to comment."

So in the quarter in general, our total operating cost stayed relatively level with last quarter. We had some movements in the pieces, we saw general and administrative expenses increase by about $3.9 million related to some of the legal costs we had with the DOC and the new gTLD program. And they were offset by some lower spend in our sales and marketing. As you may have known, we had a transition in our leadership and our marketing area, and so we had some under spend in that area at least, in the third quarter. But we at least, managed those costs and they offset one another in the quarter. So we again, look for efficiencies but for example, in the fourth quarter, which we talked about, we will have a change in the ICANN registration fees. Those will go on a more variable basis, kind of a fixed basis. So they'll go up to about $0.25 per name. So starting December 1, we'll see the fees paid to ICANN increase in cost of about $750,000 a month. So costs do vary, but we're doing our best to try to offset those increased costs with efficiencies from the long tail of the restructuring."

Of course, as you know, we just come off the restructuring, we've optimized, we've run the business much more efficiently but I'm sure a lot of you have seen in the news recently, the number of DDoS attacks against financial institutions. Some of them sustained, some of them is still continuing today, more sophisticated, larger in scale. I would just say that given the nature and growth of these attacks, obviously, we don't budget for the kinds of thing that we might need to do to adapt as some of these attacks grow but it is a fact that you're seeing playing out in today's headlines everyday, the kind of attacks against infrastructure, against -- targets for political or other reasons by nation states, at least, it's alleged in some cases. So the caveat is while we run the business very efficiently, event could of course, always dictate that we do need to make capital investments in order to stay ahead of the curve. That's how we got to where we are today with the uptime record that we have. Without getting into the process that we're in with DOC and DOJ, the question earlier about what's sort of VeriSign's position is. I mean, I would just simply point out that VeriSign has an unparalleled record of performance in the operational availability of common .net and our focus is there and that's our first job and that's the primary requirement of the ICANN contract in terms of the SLAs and that's the first of our 4-part strategy framework so we do focus there a lot. I think VeriSign's story sort of speaks for itself. We've supported an infrastructure that has allowed e-commerce to flourish and numerous billions of dollars of economic activity sit and rely on the infrastructure and I think it just simply speaks for itself that VeriSign is the secure and stable provider of that infrastructure, that's job 1 and whatever it takes to maintain that, we will."

I mean that's an assessment that would be made on a case-by-case basis. But .com is different so it's really hard to say. We don't -- we haven't done any planning that would have us in a vertical integration scenario as an operating business. Our focus is really, security and stability first and quite frankly, I think it might be awkward to actually act as a registrar ourselves. Its a very different business and as you may know, we were at one point, many years ago, in that business. When we first bought Network Solutions in June of 2000, it was of course, both a registry and a registrar and it wasn't until a few years later, I believe it was around 2003 when we sold off the retail part of that business and it was very different. So given the new sort of single focus that VeriSign is in right now, as a registry services provider, whose first mission is availability, when you consider for example, over the last 6 years, through a major restructuring, through the 2007, 2008, 2009 economic downturn, we've been able to maintain a record of security and stability. I'm sure a lot of you saw that just over the last few weeks, there were some major outages. I won't mention the names, but a large registrar and a large web services company just over the last few weeks had extended outages. If that happened to .com, I think there'd be a lot more tension, there'd be a lot more people affected, there'd be a lot more economic loss so I sort of like us as a model focused on doing one thing, which is providing absolutely secure and stable infrastructure because there is just too much that depends on it here."

I'll begin with the news on the .com renewal and then George and I will cover the key highlights for the quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions. 
By terms in an agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign called the Cooperative Agreement, we submitted our agreement with ICANN, to service the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry to the Commerce Department for its review on June 26, 2012. As a result of communications beginning in October 2012 with the Commerce Department, we learned that the Commerce Department was conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice. We believe this review, which we are participating in, may continue beyond November 30, 2012, in which case a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement would become effective. We want to emphasize that nothing has happened that changes the risk of our running .com. We expect to continue to be the registry operator of .com. Our record on security and stability has been acknowledged by the Commerce Department. We are involved in discussions with the Commerce and Justice Departments as they review the pricing terms in the .com renewal agreement. These discussions are ongoing and could extend beyond November 30. We will work diligently with them through the review process. Because of our discussions on this matter are ongoing, I'm not going to go into more detail. We will, however, update you when appropriate regarding new information. I'll now review the key highlights of the third quarter.
The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign and we continue to see benefits from our restructuring focus and discipline. In Naming, we processed 7.8 million new registrations in the third quarter while adding 1.37 million .net names, finishing the quarter with 119.9 million names in the domain name base. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $77 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $221 million and we have approximately $610 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration.
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 105 million names, while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 119.9 million at the end of September. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.37 million .net names to the domain name base and we processed 7.8 million new registrations, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago. 
In the second quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.3%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.
Net number of names added to the domain base during the third quarter were below our guidance, primarily driven by 2 factors. First, the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms we discussed during last quarter. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months continue to affect the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in our last earnings call, we have seen these search engine changes in the past, which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters. We have no way of knowing how long they'll be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment, but we are now experiencing the second quarter of these effects.
Secondly, we are seeing some signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, are also leading to softer international renewal rates. Given these 2 factors, we expect the fourth quarter .net names added to the base to be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names. 
As discussed on the last call, we post updates to the zone on our website at least once per day. With this increased transparency, you'll be able to track how the zone is growing throughout the fourth quarter. 
Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to focus our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss."

For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $224 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $116 million, up 30% from $89 million in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 51.9% compared to 45.2% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter.
GAAP net income totaled $78 million compared to $59 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in the quarter on a GAAP basis. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.
Total liabilities remained at approximately $2 billion as of the third quarter, up from $1.9 billion at year end. 
As you may have noticed, during the latter part of the third quarter, the stock price exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting them into common stock during the fourth quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivatives and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of September 30, 2012.
Total debt on the balance sheet was $703 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under the $200 million credit facility and the $603 million present value of the $1.2 billion in convertible debentures.
The convertible debentures continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2012 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $224 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic source revenue, which grew 12.7% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $809 million, an $80 million increase from year end. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million and was down 1% sequentially.
G&A operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in legal and related expenses of $3.9 million due to efforts supporting the Department of Commerce review of our renewal of .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the legal advice related to ICANN's new gTLD program. These increased expenses were expected as part of the .com renewal process and the new gTLD program, and were offset by lower sales and marketing expense in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter continued to expand and totaled 56.4% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising cost, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to benefit our operating margin.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $84 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.45 last quarter.
With respect to taxes, as stated on our last earnings call, starting from the third quarter, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 166.6 million shares in the third quarter compared to 164.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 9.2 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.6 million shares from the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q2 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter.
Operating cash flow was $122 million for the third quarter, down from $135 million in the second quarter of this year and up compared to $108 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $117 million for the third quarter of 2012, including $9 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.
With respect to guidance, we now think revenues for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $875 million, representing an annual growth rate of about 13%. We gave a range of $870 million to $880 million on the last call.
Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 55%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% to 7% of revenue. We gave a range of 6% to 8% on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to give you a progress update on our execution against the strategic framework we shared with you during our last call. Our strategic framework is how we're thinking about the business across 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. 
First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the infrastructure which we operate. As discussed earlier, we will continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement. 
Second, with respect to growth, as you may have noticed, ICANN has given updates to its timeline and process for their new gTLD program. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net. 
Third, as evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the Domain Name System. 
And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas, with the right balance, should provide unparalleled performance for our customers, businesses and consumers that rely on our critical infrastructure as well as creating value for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

But I would say to you that as we say, as we mentioned earlier during the call, as I talked about and as George talked about, it is, to a large extent, the efficiencies that we see in the business, I think, are due to the fact that we've been running the business more efficiently. Recall of course, that we've just completed a major 5-year restructuring going from over 5,000 employees to about 1,000, shedding numerous non-core businesses, having cash that is a result of proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses, a long-term 5-year divestiture program, and our focus on managing the business efficiently and on operating discipline and on being very focused. So I would say that I think we've done a very good job over the last 5 years of optimizing the business, running it very efficiently, understanding where we are. 2011 was the first year that we really operated on a full year basis as sort of the new VeriSign, focused on one particular business, that being the Registry Services business. Prior to that, we were always something else. It wasn't until past the midpoint of 2010 that we actually completed the sale of the Authentication business. So we've just come off in 2011 and now in 2012, the first year and second year of actually being a focused registry business and it takes some time to adjust to that and as we've adjusted, we've discovered efficiencies because we focus on it. We operate the business efficiently, we target efficient operation. Generally, the result of that is improving margins. So I would say that, that's a very important part of VeriSign's margin story and its efficient business."

Let me make a couple of comments to address that question, then I'll let George and Pat comment as appropriate here. First of all, you'll recall that back in 2009, that was really the first time that we saw a major change in search algorithms that targeted the monetization players who were essentially trying to exploit the search engine algorithm to get themselves placed higher in results so that they could drive traffic and monetize it themselves. We saw that over a period of time, after those changes, there was some recovery and the monetization community adapted to it. We saw in 2012, changes which affected Q2, which we've discussed with you before. I think there is a more serious effort by the search engine algorithm players here to sort of clean up search results and improve the quality, as Pat said, to drive some of the monetization community down further. So we discussed in the last call, the Panda and Penguin programs, for example, that Google utilized where they were targeting content farms, they were targeting keyword stuffers and now they're also targeting exact name matches, which typically are monetization names often. So for example, if you search for purple blue widgets, and purplebluewidgets.com happens to be a registered domain, that in the past, would've been likely to score very high in the search results. However, if the search engine algorithm is tweaked to go out and consider other factors, the age of the domain, how many pages are on it, how fresh is some of the content and give it a score, essentially, on how likely it is that it's truly quality content that the searcher might be interested in versus something that had been set up for monetization purposes, I think the search engine algorithms are essentially targeting that kind of traffic to get it out. You'll also recall that back in 2009, we said that roughly 9% of the zone, as far as we could tell, were so-called advertising names. We're not at a point right now to tell you exactly what that number is today. But I think there might be some developments where other domains have sort of -- other TLDs have targeted in a sense, this monetization community and possibly, some of those names may have been drawn away over the years and moved to other areas, which is, in a sense, a good thing because it means that these changes, while they are making a difference and I know you see that every day, we do too, of course, and while it may take longer to recover depending on how intense and how sustained these campaigns are, the fact is that there may be fewer of these names to work on in .com because of the move to other TLDs. I know Pat watches this very, very closely and George does as well so I'll invite them to comment."

So in the quarter in general, our total operating costs stayed relatively level with last quarter. We had some movements in the pieces, we saw general and administrative expenses increase by about $3.9 million related to some of the legal costs we had with the DOC and the new gTLD program. And they were offset by some lower spend in our sales and marketing. As you may have known, we had a transition in our leadership and our marketing area, and so we had some underspend in that area, at least in the third quarter. But we at least managed those costs and they offset one another in the quarter. So we, again, look for efficiencies but for example, in the fourth quarter, which we talked about, we will have a change in the ICANN registration fees. Those will go on a more variable basis, instead of a fixed basis. So they'll go up to about $0.25 per name. So starting December 1, we'll see the fees paid to ICANN increase in cost of about $750,000 a month. So costs do vary, but we're doing our best to try to offset those increased costs with efficiencies from the long tail of the restructuring."

Some of them sustained, some of them still continuing today, more sophisticated, larger in scale. I would just say that given the nature and growth of these attacks, obviously, we don't budget for the kinds of things that we might need to do to adapt as some of these attacks grow but it is a fact that you're seeing playing out in today's headlines every day, the kind of attacks against infrastructure, against targets for political or other reasons by nation states, at least, it's alleged in some cases. So the caveat is while we run the business very efficiently, events could of course, always dictate that we do need to make capital investments in order to stay ahead of the curve. That's how we got to where we are today with the uptime record that we have. Without getting into the process that we're in with DOC and DOJ, the question earlier about what sort of VeriSign's position is. I mean, I would just simply point out that VeriSign has an unparalleled record of performance in the operational availability of .com and .net and our focus is there and that's our first job and that's the primary requirement of the ICANN contract in terms of the SLAs and that's the first of our 4-part strategy framework, so we do focus there a lot. I think VeriSign's story sort of speaks for itself. We've supported an infrastructure that has allowed e-commerce to flourish and numerous billions of dollars of economic activity sit and rely on the infrastructure and I think it just simply speaks for itself that VeriSign is the secure and stable provider of that infrastructure, that's job 1 and whatever it takes to maintain that, we will."

We don't -- we haven't done any planning that would have us in a vertical integration scenario as an operating business. Our focus is really, security and stability first, and quite frankly, I think it might be awkward to actually act as a registrar ourselves. It's a very different business and as you may know, we were at one point, many years ago, in that business. When we first bought Network Solutions in June of 2000, it was of course, both a registry and a registrar and it wasn't until a few years later, I believe it was around 2003 when we sold off the retail part of that business and it was very different. So given the new sort of single focus that VeriSign is in right now, as a registry services provider, whose first mission is availability, when you consider for example, over the last 6 years, through a major restructuring, through the 2007, 2008, 2009 economic downturn, we've been able to maintain a record of security and stability. I'm sure a lot of you saw that just over the last few weeks, there were some major outages. I won't mention the names, but a large registrar and a large web services company just over the last few weeks had extended outages. If that happened to .com, I think there'd be a lot more tension, there'd be a lot more people affected, there'd be a lot more economic loss. So I sort of like us as a model focused on doing one thing, which is providing absolutely secure and stable infrastructure because there is just too much that depends on it here."

So it's more of the same, but we're very happy with the progress that we're making. I think that was the right thing for us to do and it's going well.

First, if you look at the .net domain name adds this quarter, is it possible to quantify just how much of the delta versus guidance came from the search engine changes versus macro? And then, looking at guidance for next quarter, at the midpoint, it's a pretty big downtick versus what we've seen in prior fourth quarters in the past 3, 4 years.

Yes, there were some macroeconomic headwinds, as we said earlier, particularly in Europe. Certainly, the search engine algorithm changes are a very large factor. Every year and every quarter that the zone grows, we see the law of large numbers, as we refer to it, come into play as well. Clearly, percentage growth will slow as the size of the zone gets larger. So there are a number of different factors. We have some analytics but we don't break that out separately but perhaps Pat can give you a little bit of color."

When you take a look at the renewal rate, that's largely -- where we've seen the shortfalls, really it's largely coming from monetization-type customers. I mean, that's individuals with large portfolios of domains, making pennies off of hundreds of thousands of domains, taking a look at what makes sense for their portfolio. So I would attribute the renewal rate more towards monetization than the macroeconomic trends right now although there's some in there. When you take a look at the new units, things that we have coming out of Europe right now, we're seeing registrars position domain names in the purchase flow that benefit local currency. So they're paying -- if it's a euro-based country, they're taking euro-based registrations and then we, of course, take all of our registrations in U.S. dollars. So there's some of that, that we see as part of the slight shortfall that we have in new units."
