Thank you for joining us for TECO Energy's fourth quarter results conference call and webcast. Our earnings, along with unaudited financial statements, were released and filed with the SEC earlier this morning. This presentation is being webcast and our earnings release, financial statements and the slides for this presentation are available on our website at tecoenergy.com. The presentation will be available for replay through the website approximately 2 hours after the end of the presentation this morning and will be available for 30 days.
In the course of our remarks today, we'll be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook and plans for 2012. There are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that we'll discuss as our outlook and expectations today. For a more complete discussion of these factors, we refer you to the discussion of the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2010, and as updated in subsequent SEC filings.
Also, today we'll be using non-GAAP measures in the course of the presentation. There are reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure along with other helpful information contained in the appendix to today's presentation. On our call this morning, Sandy Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, who will cover the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results and discuss our dividend increase announced this morning and our guidance for 2012. Also with us today to participate in answering your questions is John Ramil, our CEO. Now let me turn it over to Sandy."

Mark gave an overview of what I'll cover and I will assure you that I'll allow plenty of time for Q&A at the end. In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $53.2 million or $0.25 a share compared to $56.7 million or $0.27 in 2010. There were no charges or gains in the fourth quarter of 2011 while results in 2010 included a net gain of $7.8 million, which captured the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in DECA II and the charge for the earlier retirement of TECO Energy. So the non-GAAP comparison for 2010 is $48.9 million or $0.23 a share, which excludes those charges and gains. 
On a full-year basis, GAAP net income in 2011 was $272.6 million or $1.27 per share compared to $239 million or $1.12 in 2010. The 2010 non-GAAP results were $275.5 million or $1.29 per share. Excluding net charges of $36.5 million related to debt retirement premium, taxes on the undistributed earnings of DECA II and the gain on the sale of DECA II. The results drivers for the quarter and year-to-date period were covered extensively in the earnings release and I'll cover a few highlights. The real driver for Tampa Electric was mild weather compared to 2010 when we had a fourth quarter with extremely cold weather. 
As measured by heating degree days, December of 2011 was the mildest December we've experienced since 1992. Around the holiday the Tampa area was it records for high temperatures but it wasn't hot enough to generate cooling load. Also in the fourth quarter, this time measured by cooling degree days we saw the mildest October we've experienced again, since 1992. For the year, the weather worked against us 3 out of the 4 quarters. We had a mild late winter in the first quarter, a wet summer and then the fourth quarter with this Chamber of Commerce start to the 2011 2012 winter. 
Tampa Electric reported $31 million lower base revenues this year. But remember in 2010, revenue was reduced by $24 million under our regulatory settlement. So the change in revenue from 2010 favorable weather to a year with really unfavorable weather was actually $55 million. The very positive news was customer growth and improvements in the economy. The fourth quarter customer growth was 8/10 of a percent, representing about 5,000 additional customers and the full-year customer growth was 7/10. 
The stronger economy is evident in commercial sales, which held up well for the full year despite the weather and a non-phosphate industrial sales, which increased throughout the year. Significant factor in mitigating some of the weather impact in 2011 was successful management of cost by all of the operating companies all of the operating areas at Tampa Electric as outlined in our earnings release. Peoples Gas had an interesting mix of sales results for the quarter and the year. 
Residential firm sales were lower in both periods due to the milder weather in 2011 compared to the prior year. While industrial and commercial sales volumes were higher reflecting the improvements we're seeing in the economy. Volumes there were higher for consumer related customers such as food processing and packaging and several asphalt and chemical plants had higher consumption as well. All system sales were lower due to the new capacity on the FGG pipeline that went in service about midyear. But power generators used more natural gas because of the lower gas prices. 
Like Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas experienced stronger customer growth in the fourth quarter at 1.1% and saw 8/10 of a percent growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, TECO Coal average selling price rose to $92 per ton and the full year selling price was on guidance at $88. That reflects a sales mix of 46% specialty coal and 54% steam. The all-in cost of production rose this quarter to more than $82 per ton with cost drivers similar to those discussed in previous quarters. 
The per ton cost for the full year was just under $80. The net effect of year-over-year price and cost changes was a pretax margin expansion of $1. Fourth quarter sales volumes were slightly below last year at 1.9 million tons and the full year was 700,000 tons lower at 8.1 million tons. If you exclude the 4.1 million of benefits related to state and federal tax settlement included in 2010 net income, 2011 results reflect the year-over-year increase of about 5%. 
And to complete the summary of results, the San José Power Station operated well and enjoyed higher spot sales at better prices. Full-year results at TECO Guatemala reflect the lower capacity payments of the Albarado filed power station and the absence of earnings from DECA II, which was sold in October 2010. The impact of that sale was largely offset by the lower interest expense at TECO Energy parent because of the debt we retired with the sale proceeds. 
I want to wrap up the report on 2011 with a look back at this table that we showed at the end of 2010, which was intended to provide a baseline for 2011, it captured items that affected 2010 that weren't expected to reoccur like the extraordinarily cold weather, Tampa Electric's regulatory stipulation and some large tax items. And it captured the projected effect on 2011 of actions taken in 2010 like the Alborada contract expansion, sale of DECA II and retirement of parent debt. 
This baseline effectively put Tampa Electric at a revenue level representative of normal weather before growth, which we have estimated here would be pretax base revenues about $35 million lower than 2010 while in fact, base revenues were $55 million lower, which is indicative of just how mild the weather was this year. Now turning to what we're seeing in the Tampa state economy. There are a number of graphs in the appendix that present some economic trend information that we routinely shared with you. And you'll see in all of the metrics that we track the continuation of the positive trends we've been reporting all year. 
The unemployment rates in both the state and local areas are continuing to improve. At the end of the year, Florida's unemployment rates had declined to 9.7% and the local rate declined even more to 9.5%, a dramatic improvement from the 12% and 11.6%, respectively that we saw at the end of 2010. Year-to-date, Florida has added a net 114,000 new jobs, an increase of 1.6%, outpacing the 1.3% national increase. And that employment growth has been in the sectors that are shown here on the slide. 
In the same period, the Tampa metropolitan area added 28,000 new jobs again in the sectors shown, and the expectation is for continued modest improvement in 2012. The housing market also continued to improve in 2011. Historically, new-home construction was a major driver of growth in Tampa and in the states. Metrostudy a firm that monitors the new home construction industry reports that new housing starts and closing increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and an increase of new-home construction activity is also expected in 2012. 
Existing home resales in 2011 were 11% higher than in 2010, which is particularly noticeable when you considered 2010 included the homebuyer tax credit program. And prices of existing home resales, as measured by the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors, after bottoming out in January 2011 have been higher each month throughout the year. The inventory of existing homes on the market has consistently been around 6 months this year, compared to 8 at the end of 2010 and 25 at the deepest downturn. 
That inventory only includes homes actively on the market and doesn't include foreclosed properties not on the market. RealtyTrac data shows that foreclosure activity trended down in Tampa Electric service area in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in 2011. The data shows that at the end of 2011, there were 9,000 homes in various stages of foreclosure in the local area, which is down from 60,000 in March. 
We've been very cautious that the foreclosure backlog had the potential to reverse some of the improvements we've seen in the housing market. At the fact that prices have been trending up all year and inventory levels have held at a healthy 6-month all year. At the same time that these foreclosures were being absorbed into the market, it's a very good sign. Consistent with our announcement last February, our board changed the timing of its annual review of our dividend to the first quarter. 
Earlier this morning, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which represents a 3.5% increase on an annual basis to $0.88 per share in 2012. The new dividend represents a 65% payout at the middle of our guidance range consistent with the target payout ratio of 60% to 70% announced last year. Turning to our 2012 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share in 2012. This range allows for variations and factors such as weather and utilities and production costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal. 
Into 2012, we expect both utilities to continue to earn within their respective ROE ranges. We expect customer growth to be in line with the trends we saw in 2011 with growth nearing the 1% level and we assume normal weather. While we have to meet the challenge of higher depreciation from normal capital addition to serve customers and pressure on pension and benefits cost before discount rates, the utilities will get the benefit of lower interest expense with the opportunity to refinance about $460 million of 2012 maturities in a low interest rate environment. 
On the regulatory front, we will undertake the determination of the process for Tampa Electric's next generation expansion, the Polk combined cycle conversion that I described last quarter. In connection with this, we will begin the initial engineering work this year for the plant and transmission system upgrades to support the generation expansion. Peoples Gas capital spending this year will include several project to expand the system to supply commercial, to supply economical and clean natural gas to large customers currently using petroleum or propane. 
As described in our release last month, TECO Coal expects sales to be between 7.1 million and 7.3 million tons in 2012 at an average price of about $96 per ton with about 50% of those sales going to the met PCI and silver coal markets. On the cost side, the fully loaded average production cost is expected to be in a range between $83 and $87 per ton. This takes into account the impact of higher selling prices, as well as spreading fixed cost over fewer ton. 
The $8 per ton increase in the average selling price this year adds almost $1 per ton to cost from royalties and severance taxes. And spreading the same fixed cost over 1 million fewer tons affects cost by about $3 per ton. Our 2012 capital spending will include about $5 million for permitting and initial surface development related to the met coal reserves that we told you about last November to keep that activity moving forward while we continue to evaluate the specific market and mining plans. 
The outlook for TECO Guatemala assumes normal operations at both powerplants except for scheduled turbine overhaul outage at the San José power plant, which we expect to reduce net income by about $4 million in 2012. I show you this next slide to illustrate the point that results in the coal business are driven by margin and not by volume. From 2008 to 2011, TECO Coal’s net income has almost tripled while volumes actually decreased by more than 1 million tons over the same timeframe. 
Much of the margin expansion driving the slope of the net income line has come from a greater proportion of specialty coal and sales mix. While that is also true in 2012, keep in mind that more than $3 a ton of the improvement in 2012 is attributable to the replacement of that significantly below market, 600,000-ton steam coal contracts. You'll recall that we re-contracted those tons for 2012 in the second quarter of 2011 in a stronger steam coal market that we're seeing today. You can see here that coal sales are already pretty well contracted for 2012. 
We are effectively sold-out on our steam coal and substantially all of our met coal is contracted as well. The unsold tons are primarily PCI times. I'll close with our investor communication plans over the next several months. We expect to file our 10-K at the end of February and we'll be at the UBS conference in Dallas later that same week. In March, we'll be busy with the European roadshow and we'll participate in the EEI Europe conference in London. We'll also be at the Morgan Stanley conference in New York that week. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for your question."

The cost associated with our long-term disability plan, which you would record those costs under FAS 112 was substantially lower this year and that is driven completely by fewer people who were out on long-term disability and that is a result of a very dedicated on safety that's been in place for a long time and we're really beginning to see some of the benefits of that materialize, same thing on the workers comp side. So just good management of operations. Another small example is bad debt expense where as you know, we have not seen the kinds of impacts from that that some other companies in other parts of the country have. But that's now starting to trend down a little bit because we've managed that very effectively over the last couple of years. So it's a little bit here and a little bit there and it really added up to some excellent O&M performance by all of the areas of the company this year."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Mark gave you an overview of what I'll cover and I will assure you that I'll allow plenty of time for Q&A at the end.In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $53.2 million or $0.25",2207,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Mark gave you an overview of what I'll cover and I will assure you that I'll allow plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $53.2 million or $0.25 a share compared to $56.7 million or $0.27 in 2010. There were no charges or gains in the fourth quarter of 2011, while results in 2010 included a net gain of $7.8 million, which captured the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in DECA II and the charge for the early retirement of TECO Energy debt. So the non-GAAP comparison for 2010 is $48.9 million or $0.23 a share, which excludes those charges and gains.
On a full-year basis, GAAP net income in 2011 was $272.6 million or $1.27 per share compared to $239 million or $1.12 in 2010. The 2010 non-GAAP results were $275.5 million or $1.29 per share. Excluding net charges of $36.5 million related to debt retirement premiums, taxes on the undistributed earnings of DECA II and the gain on the sale of DECA II. The results drivers for the quarter and year-to-date period were covered extensively in the earnings release and I'll cover a few highlights. The real driver for Tampa Electric was mild weather compared to 2010 when we had a fourth quarter with extremely cold weather.
As measured by heating degree days, December of 2011 was the mildest December we've experienced since 1992. Around the holiday, the Tampa area was tying records for high temperatures, but it wasn't hot enough to generate cooling load. Also in the fourth quarter, this time measured by cooling degree days, we saw the mildest October we've experienced, again, since 1992. For the year, the weather worked against us 3 out of the 4 quarters. We had a mild late winter in the first quarter, a wet summer and then the fourth quarter with it's Chamber of Commerce start to the 2011 2012 winter.
Tampa Electric reported $31 million lower base revenues this year. But remember, in 2010, revenue was reduced by $24 million under our regulatory settlement. So the change in revenue from 2010 with favorable weather to a year with really unfavorable weather was actually $55 million. The very positive news was customer growth and improvements in the economy. The fourth quarter customer growth was 0.8%, representing about 5,000 additional customers and the full-year customer growth was 0.7%.
The stronger economy is evident in commercial sales, which held up well for the full year despite the weather, and a non-phosphate industrial sales which increased throughout the year. A significant factor in mitigating some of the weather impact in 2011 was successful management of cost by all of the operating companies, all of the operating areas at Tampa Electric as outlined in our earnings release. 
Peoples Gas had an interesting mix of sales results for the quarter and the year. Residential therm sales were lower in both periods due to the milder weather in 2011 compared to the prior year. While industrial and commercial sales volumes were higher reflecting the improvements we're seeing in the economy. Volumes there were higher for consumer related customers, such as food processing and packaging, and several asphalt and chemical plants had higher consumption as well. All system sales were lower due to the new capacity on the FGG pipeline that went in service about midyear. The power generators used more natural gas because of the lower gas prices.
Like Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas experienced stronger customer growth in the fourth quarter at 1.1% and saw 8/10 of a percent growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, TECO Coal's average selling price rose to $92 per ton and the full year selling price was on guidance at $88. That reflects a sales mix of 46% specialty coal and 54% steam. The all-in cost of production rose this quarter to more than $82 per ton with cost drivers similar to those discussed in previous quarters.
The per ton cost for the full year was just under $80. The net effect of year-over-year price and cost changes was a pretax margin expansion of $1 a ton. Fourth quarter sales volumes were slightly below last year at 1.9 million tons and the full year was 700,000 tons lower at 8.1 million tons. If you exclude the 4.1 million of benefits related to state and federal tax settlements included in 2010 net income, 2011 results reflect a year-over-year increase of about 5%.
And to complete the summary of results, the San José Power Station operated well and enjoyed higher spot sales at better prices. Full-year results at TECO Guatemala reflect the lower capacity payments of the Albarado Power Station and the absence of earnings from DECA II, which was sold in October of 2010. The impact of that sale was largely offset by the lower interest expense at TECO Energy parent because of the debt we retired with the sale proceeds.
I want to wrap up the report on 2011 with a look back at this table that we showed at the end of 2010, which was intended to provide a baseline for 2011. It captured items that affected 2010 that weren't expected to reoccur, like the extraordinarily cold weather, Tampa Electric's regulatory stipulation and some large tax items. And it captured the projected effect on 2011 of actions taken in 2010, like the Alborada contract expansion, sale of DECA II and retirement of parent debt.
This baseline effectively put Tampa Electric at a revenue level representative of normal weather before growth, which we have estimated here would be pretax base revenues about $35 million lower than 2010, while in fact, base revenues were $55 million lower, which is indicative of just how mild the weather was this year.
Now turning to what we're seeing in the Tampa and state economy. There are a number of graphs in the appendix that present some economic trend information that we routinely shared with you. And you'll see, in all of the metrics that we track, the continuation of the positive trends we've been reporting all year.
The unemployment rates in both the state and local areas are continuing to improve. At the end of the year, Florida's unemployment rates had declined to 9.7% and the local rate declined even more to 9.5%. A dramatic improvement from the 12% and 11.6%, respectively that we saw at the end of 2010. Year-to-date, Florida has added a net 114,000 new jobs, an increase of 1.6%, outpacing the 1.3% national increase. And that employment growth has been in the sectors that are shown here on the slide.
In the same period, the Tampa Metropolitan Area added 28,000 new jobs, again in the sectors shown and the expectation is for continued modest improvement in 2012. The housing market also continued to improve in 2011. Historically, new home construction was a major driver of growth in Tampa and in the state. Metrostudy, a firm that monitors the new home construction industry, reports that new housing starts and closings increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and an increase in new home construction activity is also expected in 2012.
Existing home resales in 2011 were 11% higher than in 2010, which is particularly noticeable when you considered that 2010 included the homebuyer tax credit program. And prices of existing home resales, as measured by the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors, after bottoming out in January 2011, have been higher each month throughout the year. The inventory of existing homes on the market has consistently been around 6 months this year, compared to 8 at the end of 2010 and 25 at the deepest part of the downturn.
That inventory only includes homes actively on the market and doesn't include foreclosed properties not on the market. RealtyTrac data shows that foreclosure activity trended down in Tampa Electric service area in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in 2011. The data shows that at the end of 2011, there were 9,000 homes in various stages of foreclosure in the local area, which is down from 16,000 in March. 
We've been very cautious that the foreclosure backlog had the potential to reverse some of the improvements we've seen in the housing market. But the fact that prices have been trending up all year and inventory levels have held at a healthy 6-month all year, at the same time that these foreclosures were being absorbed into the market, it's a very good sign. Consistent with our announcement last February, our board changed the timing of its annual review of our dividend to the first quarter.
Earlier this morning, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which represents a 3.5% increase on an annual basis to $0.88 per share in 2012. The new dividend represents a 65% payout at the middle of our guidance range, consistent with the target payout ratio of 60% to 70% announced last year. Turning to our 2012 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share in 2012. This range allows for variations and factors such as weather at the utilities and production costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal.
In 2012, we expect both utilities to continue to earn within their respective ROE ranges. We expect customer growth to be in line with the trends we saw in 2011, with growth nearing the 1% level, and we assume normal weather. While we'll have to meet the challenge of higher depreciation from normal capital additions to serve customers, and pressure on pension and benefits cost before discount rates, the utilities will get the benefit of lower interest expense with the opportunity to refinance about $460 million of 2012 maturities in a low interest rate environment.
On the regulatory front, we will undertake the determination of need process for Tampa Electric's next increment of generation expansion, the Polk combined-cycle conversion that I described last quarter. In connection with this, we will begin the initial engineering work this year for the plant and transmission system upgrades to support the generation expansion. Peoples Gas capital spending this year will include several project to expand the system to supply commercial -- to supply economical and clean natural gas to large customers currently using petroleum or propane.
As described in our release last month, TECO Coal expects sales to be between 7.1 million and 7.3 million tons in 2012, at an average price of about $96 per ton, with about 50% of those sales going to the met, PCI and stoker coal markets. On the cost side, the fully loaded average production cost is expected to be in a range between $83 and $87 per ton. This takes into account the impact of higher selling prices, as well as spreading fixed cost over fewer tons. The $8 per ton increase in the average selling price this year adds almost $1 per ton to cost from royalties and severance taxes and spreading the same fixed cost over 1 million fewer tons affects cost by about $3 per ton. Our 2012 capital spending will include about $5 million for permitting an initial surface development related to the new met coal reserves we told you about last November, to keep that activity moving forward while we continue to evaluate the specific market and mining plans.
The outlook for TECO Guatemala assumes normal operations at both power plants except for a scheduled turbine overhaul outage at the San José power plant, which we expect to reduce net income by about $4 million in 2012. I show you this next slide to illustrate the point that results in the coal business are driven by margin and not by volume. From 2008 to 2011, TECO Coal’s net income has almost tripled while volumes actually decreased by more than 1 million tons over the same timeframe.
Much of the margin expansion driving the slope of the net income line has come from a greater proportion of specialty coal and sales mix. While that is also true in 2012, keep in mind that more than $3 a ton of the improvement in 2012 is attributable to the replacement of that significantly below market, 600,000-ton steam coal contracts. You'll recall that we re-contracted those tons for 2012 in the second quarter of 2011 in a stronger steam coal market that we're seeing today. You can see here that coal sales are already pretty well contracted for 2012.
We are effectively sold-out on our steam coal and substantially all of our met coal is contracted as well. The unsold tons are primarily PCI tons. I'll close with our investor communication plans over the next several months. We expect to file our 10-K at the end of February and we'll be at the UBS conference in Dallas later that same week. In March, we'll be busy with the European Non-Deal [ph] Roadshow and we'll participate in the EEI Europe conference in London. We'll also be at the Morgan Stanley conference in New York that week.
And now, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for your question."

Some of them a while in the making, some of them the result of looking hard at processes and approaches to things. But I'll give you an example. The cost associated with our long-term disability plan, which you record those costs under FAS 112, was substantially lower this year and that is driven completely by fewer people who are out on long-term disability. And that is a result of a very dedicated bid on safety, that's been in place for a long time and we're really beginning to see some of the benefits of that materialize, same thing on the workers comp side. So just good management of operations. Another small example is bad debt expense where, as you know, we have not seen the kinds of impacts from that, that some other companies in other parts of the country have. But that's now starting to trend down a little bit because we've managed that very effectively over the last couple of years.

I know that you guys aspired to infuse more equity capital into utility and we know that you've got some volatility in the cash flow profile, pretty much every year as it pertains to the coal business. But with one of the better free cash flow yields in the utility group, I wonder why you're not targeting the higher end of your dividend payout ratio aspiration when the difference between being at a 70% payout and $0.95 a share versus a 65% payout and $0.88 share is $15 million a year. It would seem to be that, in an environment where investors clear their craving income, that with such a small impact on your cash flow flexibility that you ought to be at the high end of the range, can you comment on that?"

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Mark gave you an overview of what I'll cover and I will assure you that I'll allow plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $53.2 million or $0.25 a share compared to $56.7 million or $0.27 in 2010. There were no charges or gains in the fourth quarter of 2011, while results in 2010 included a net gain of $7.8 million, which captured the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in DECA II and a charge for the early retirement of TECO Energy debt. So the non-GAAP comparison for 2010 is $48.9 million or $0.23 a share, which excludes those charges and gains.
On a full-year basis, GAAP net income in 2011 was $272.6 million or $1.27 per share compared to $239 million or $1.12 in 2010. The 2010 non-GAAP results were $275.5 million or $1.29 per share. Excluding net charges of $36.5 million related to debt retirement premiums, taxes on the undistributed earnings of DECA II and the gain on the sale of DECA II.
The results drivers for the quarter and year-to-date period were covered extensively in the earnings release and I'll cover a few highlights. The real driver for Tampa Electric was mild weather compared to 2010 when we had a fourth quarter with extremely cold weather.
As measured by heating degree-days, December of 2011 was the mildest December we've experienced since 1992. Around the holidays, the Tampa area was tying records for high temperatures, but it wasn't hot enough to generate cooling load. Also in the fourth quarter, this time measured by cooling degree-days, we saw the mildest October we've experienced, again, since 1992. For the year, the weather worked against us 3 out of the 4 quarters. We had a mild late winter in the first quarter, a wet summer and then the fourth quarter with its Chamber of Commerce start to the 2011, 2012 winter.
Tampa Electric reported $31 million lower base revenues this year. But remember, in 2010, revenue was reduced by $24 million under our regulatory settlement. So the change in revenue from 2010 with favorable weather to a year with really unfavorable weather was actually $55 million. The very positive news was customer growth and improvements in the economy. The fourth quarter customer growth was 0.8%, representing about 5,000 additional customers and the full-year customer growth was 0.7%.
The stronger economy is evident in commercial sales, which held up well for the full year despite the weather, and in non-phosphate industrial sales, which increased throughout the year. A significant factor in mitigating some of the weather impact in 2011 was successful management of costs by all of the operating companies, all of the operating areas at Tampa Electric as outlined in our earnings release.
Peoples Gas had an interesting mix of sales results for the quarter and the year. Residential therm sales were lower in both periods due to the milder weather in 2011 compared to the prior year. While industrial and commercial sales volumes were higher reflecting the improvements we're seeing in the economy. Volumes there were higher for consumer related customers, such as food processing and packaging, and several asphalt and chemical plants had higher consumption as well. All system sales were lower due to the new capacity on the FGT pipeline that went in service about midyear. The power generators used more natural gas because of the lower gas prices.
Like Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas experienced stronger customer growth in the fourth quarter at 1.1% and saw 0.8 of a percent growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, TECO Coal's average selling price rose to $92 per ton and the full year selling price was on guidance at $88. That reflects a sales mix of 46% specialty coals and 54% steam. The all-in cost of production rose this quarter to more than $82 per ton with cost drivers similar to those discussed in previous quarters.
The per ton cost for the full year was just under $80. The net effect of year-over-year price and cost changes was a pretax margin expansion of $1 a ton. Fourth quarter sales volumes were slightly below last year at 1.9 million tons and the full year was 700,000 tons lower at 8.1 million tons. If you exclude the 4.1 million of benefits related to state and federal tax settlements included in 2010 net income, 2011 results reflect a year-over-year increase of about 5%.
And to complete the summary of results, the San José Power Station operated well and enjoyed higher spot sales at better prices. Full-year results at TECO Guatemala reflect the lower capacity payments of the Alborado Power Station and the absence of earnings from DECA II, which was sold in October of 2010. The impact of that sale was largely offset by the lower interest expense at TECO Energy parent because of the debt we retired with the sale proceeds.
I want to wrap up the report on 2011 with a look back at this table that we showed at the end of 2010, which was intended to provide a baseline for 2011. It captured items that affected 2010 that weren't expected to reoccur, like the extraordinarily cold weather, Tampa Electric's regulatory stipulation and some large tax items. And it captured the projected effect on 2011 of actions taken in 2010, like the Alborada contract expansion, sale of DECA II and retirement of parent debt.
This baseline effectively put Tampa Electric at a revenue level representative of normal weather before growth, which we have estimated here would be pretax base revenues about $35 million lower than 2010, while in fact, base revenues were $55 million lower, which is indicative of just how mild the weather was this year.
Now turning to what we're seeing in the Tampa and state economy. There are a number of graphs in the appendix that present some economic trend information that we've routinely shared with you. And you'll see, in all of the metrics that we track, the continuation of the positive trends we've been reporting all year.
The unemployment rates in both the state and local areas are continuing to improve. At the end of the year, Florida's unemployment rates had declined to 9.7% and the local rate declined even more to 9.5%. A dramatic improvement from the 12% and 11.6%, respectively, that we saw at the end of 2010. Year-to-date, Florida has added a net 114,000 new jobs, an increase of 1.6%, outpacing the 1.3% national increase. And that employment growth has been in the sectors that are shown here on the slide.
In the same period, the Tampa metropolitan area added 28,000 new jobs, again in the sectors shown. And the expectation is for continued modest improvement in 2012. The housing market also continued to improve in 2011. Historically, new home construction was a major driver of growth in Tampa and in the state. Metrostudy, a firm that monitors the new home construction industry, reports that new housing starts and closings increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and an increase in new home construction activity is also expected in 2012.
Existing home resales in 2011 were 11% higher than in 2010, which is particularly noticeable when you consider that 2010 included the homebuyer tax credit program. And prices of existing home resales, as measured by the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors, after bottoming out in January 2011, have been higher each month throughout the year. The inventory of existing homes on the market has consistently been around 6 months this year, compared to 8 at the end of 2010 and 25 at the deepest point of the downturn.
That inventory only includes homes actively on the market and doesn't include foreclosed properties not on the market. RealtyTrac data shows that foreclosure activity trended down in Tampa Electric service area in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in 2011. The data shows that at the end of 2011, there were 9,000 homes in various stages of foreclosure in the local area, which is down from 16,000 in March.
We've been very cautious that the foreclosure backlog had the potential to reverse some of the improvements we've seen in the housing market. But the fact that prices have been trending up all year and inventory levels have held at a healthy 6 months all year, at the same time that these foreclosures were being absorbed into the market, is a very good sign. Consistent with our announcement last February, our Board changed the timing of its annual review of our dividend to the first quarter.
Earlier this morning, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which represents a 3.5% increase on an annual basis to $0.88 per share in 2012. The new dividend represents a 65% payout at the middle of our guidance range, consistent with the target payout ratio of 60% to 70% announced last year. Turning to our 2012 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share in 2012. This range allows for variations and factors such as weather at the utilities and production costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal.
In 2012, we expect both utilities to continue to earn within their respective ROE ranges. We expect customer growth to be in line with the trends we saw in 2011, with growth nearing the 1% level, and we assume normal weather. While we'll have to meet the challenge of higher depreciation from normal capital additions to serve customers, and pressure on pension and benefits costs before discount rates, the utilities will get the benefit of lower interest expense with the opportunity to refinance about $460 million of 2012 maturities in a low interest rate environment.
On the regulatory front, we will undertake the determination of need process for Tampa Electric's next increment of generation expansion, the Polk combined-cycle conversion that I described last quarter. In connection with this, we will begin the initial engineering work this year for the plant and transmission system upgrades to support the generation expansion. Peoples Gas capital spending this year will include several project to expand the system to supply commercial -- to supply economical and clean natural gas to large customers currently using petroleum or propane.
As described in our release last month, TECO Coal expects sales to be between 7.1 million and 7.3 million tons in 2012, at an average price of about $96 per ton, with about 50% of those sales going to the met, PCI and stoker coal markets. On the cost side, the fully loaded average production cost is expected to be in a range between $83 and $87 per ton. This takes into account the impact of higher selling prices, as well as spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. The $8 per ton increase in the average selling price this year adds almost $1 per ton to costs from royalties and severance taxes and spreading the same fixed costs over 1 million fewer tons affects costs by about $3 per ton. Our 2012 capital spending will include about $5 million for permitting an initial surface development related to the new met coal reserves that we told you about last November, to keep that activity moving forward while we continue to evaluate the specific market and mining plans.
The outlook for TECO Guatemala assumes normal operations at both power plants except for a scheduled turbine overhaul outage at the San José power plant, which we expect to reduce net income by about $4 million in 2012. I show you this next slide to illustrate the point that results in the coal business are driven by margins and not by volume. From 2008 to 2011, TECO Coal’s net income has almost tripled while volumes actually decreased by more than 1 million tons over the same timeframe.
Much of the margin expansion driving the slope of the net income line has come from a greater proportion of specialty coal in the sales mix. While that is also true in 2012, keep in mind that more than $3 a ton of the improvement in 2012 is attributable to the replacement of that significantly below market, 600,000-ton steam coal contracts You'll recall that we re-contracted those tons for 2012 in the second quarter of 2011 in a stronger steam coal market than we're seeing today. You can see here that coal sales are already pretty well contracted for 2012.
We are effectively sold-out on our steam coal and substantially all of our met coal is contracted as well. The unsold tons are primarily PCI tons. I'll close with our investor communication plans over the next several months. We expect to file our 10-K at the end of February and we'll be at the UBS Conference in Dallas later that same week. In March, we'll be busy with the European Non-Deal Roadshow [ph] and we'll participate in the EEI Europe conference in London. We'll also be at the Morgan Stanley conference in New York that week.
And now, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for your questions."

Some of them a while in the making, some of them the result of looking hard at processes and approaches to things. But I'll give you an example. The costs associated with our long-term disability plan, which you record those costs under FAS 112, was substantially lower this year and that is driven completely by fewer people who are out on long-term disability. And that is a result of a very dedicated focus on safety, that's been in place for a long time and we're really beginning to see some of the benefits of that materialize, same thing on the workers comp side. So just good management of operations. Another small example is bad debt expense where, as you know, we have not seen the kinds of impacts from that, that some other companies in other parts of the country have. But that's now starting to trend down a little bit because we've managed that very effectively over the last couple of years.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Mark gave you an overview of what I'll cover and I will assure you that I'll allow plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $53.2 million or $0.25 a share compared to $56.7 million or $0.27 in 2010. There were no charges or gains in the fourth quarter of 2011, while results in 2010 included a net gain of $7.8 million, which captured the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in DECA II and a charge for the early retirement of TECO Energy debt. So the non-GAAP comparison for 2010 is $48.9 million or $0.23 a share, which excludes those charges and gains.
On a full-year basis, GAAP net income in 2011 was $272.6 million or $1.27 per share compared to $239 million or $1.12 in 2010. The 2010 non-GAAP results were $275.5 million or $1.29 per share. Excluding net charges of $36.5 million related to debt retirement premiums, taxes on the undistributed earnings of DECA II and the gain on the sale of DECA II.
The results drivers for the quarter and year-to-date period were covered extensively in the earnings release and I'll cover a few highlights. The real driver for Tampa Electric was mild weather compared to 2010 when we had a fourth quarter with extremely cold weather.
As measured by heating degree-days, December of 2011 was the mildest December we've experienced since 1992. Around the holidays, the Tampa area was tying records for high temperatures, but it wasn't hot enough to generate cooling load. Also in the fourth quarter, this time measured by cooling degree-days, we saw the mildest October we've experienced, again, since 1992. For the year, the weather worked against us 3 out of the 4 quarters. We had a mild late winter in the first quarter, a wet summer and then the fourth quarter with its Chamber of Commerce start to the 2011, 2012 winter.
Tampa Electric reported $31 million lower base revenues this year. But remember, in 2010, revenue was reduced by $24 million under our regulatory settlement. So the change in revenue from 2010 with favorable weather to a year with really unfavorable weather was actually $55 million. The very positive news was customer growth and improvements in the economy. The fourth quarter customer growth was 0.8%, representing about 5,000 additional customers and the full-year customer growth was 0.7%.
The stronger economy is evident in commercial sales, which held up well for the full year despite the weather, and in non-phosphate industrial sales, which increased throughout the year. A significant factor in mitigating some of the weather impact in 2011 was successful management of costs by all of the operating companies, all of the operating areas at Tampa Electric as outlined in our earnings release.
Peoples Gas had an interesting mix of sales results for the quarter and the year. Residential therm sales were lower in both periods due to the milder weather in 2011 compared to the prior year. While industrial and commercial sales volumes were higher reflecting the improvements we're seeing in the economy. Volumes there were higher for consumer related customers, such as food processing and packaging, and several asphalt and chemical plants had higher consumption as well. All system sales were lower due to the new capacity on the FGT pipeline that went in service about midyear. The power generators used more natural gas because of the lower gas prices.
Like Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas experienced stronger customer growth in the fourth quarter at 1.1% and saw 0.8% growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, TECO Coal's average selling price rose to $92 per ton and the full year selling price was on guidance at $88. That reflects a sales mix of 46% specialty coals and 54% steam. The all-in cost of production rose this quarter to more than $82 per ton with cost drivers similar to those discussed in previous quarters.
The per ton cost for the full year was just under $80. The net effect of year-over-year price and cost changes was a pretax margin expansion of $1 a ton. Fourth quarter sales volumes were slightly below last year at 1.9 million tons and the full year was 700,000 tons lower at 8.1 million tons. If you exclude the 4.1 million of benefits related to state and federal tax settlements included in 2010 net income, 2011 results reflect a year-over-year increase of about 5%.
And to complete the summary of results, the San José Power Station operated well and enjoyed higher spot sales at better prices. Full-year results at TECO Guatemala reflect the lower capacity payments of the Alborada Power Station and the absence of earnings from DECA II, which was sold in October of 2010. The impact of that sale was largely offset by the lower interest expense at TECO Energy parent because of the debt we retired with the sale proceeds.
I want to wrap up the report on 2011 with a look back at this table that we showed at the end of 2010, which was intended to provide a baseline for 2011. It captured items that affected 2010 that weren't expected to reoccur, like the extraordinarily cold weather, Tampa Electric's regulatory stipulation and some large tax items. And it captured the projected effect on 2011 of actions taken in 2010, like the Alborada contract expansion, sale of DECA II and retirement of parent debt.
This baseline effectively put Tampa Electric at a revenue level representative of normal weather before growth, which we have estimated here would be pretax base revenues about $35 million lower than 2010, while in fact, base revenues were $55 million lower, which is indicative of just how mild the weather was this year.
Now turning to what we're seeing in the Tampa and state economy. There are a number of graphs in the appendix that present some economic trend information that we've routinely shared with you. And you'll see, in all of the metrics that we track, the continuation of the positive trends we've been reporting all year.
The unemployment rates in both the state and local areas are continuing to improve. At the end of the year, Florida's unemployment rates had declined to 9.7% and the local rate declined even more to 9.5%. A dramatic improvement from the 12% and 11.6%, respectively, that we saw at the end of 2010. Year-to-date, Florida has added a net 114,000 new jobs, an increase of 1.6%, outpacing the 1.3% national increase. And that employment growth has been in the sectors that are shown here on the slide.
In the same period, the Tampa metropolitan area added 28,000 new jobs, again in the sectors shown. And the expectation is for continued modest improvement in 2012. The housing market also continued to improve in 2011. Historically, new home construction was a major driver of growth in Tampa and in the state. Metrostudy, a firm that monitors the new home construction industry, reports that new housing starts and closings increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and an increase in new home construction activity is also expected in 2012.
Existing home resales in 2011 were 11% higher than in 2010, which is particularly noticeable when you consider that 2010 included the homebuyer tax credit program. And prices of existing home resales, as measured by the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors, after bottoming out in January 2011, have been higher each month throughout the year. The inventory of existing homes on the market has consistently been around 6 months this year, compared to 8 at the end of 2010 and 25 at the deepest point of the downturn.
That inventory only includes homes actively on the market and doesn't include foreclosed properties not on the market. RealtyTrac data shows that foreclosure activity trended down in Tampa Electric service area in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in 2011. The data shows that at the end of 2011, there were 9,000 homes in various stages of foreclosure in the local area, which is down from 16,000 in March.
We've been very cautious that the foreclosure backlog had the potential to reverse some of the improvements we've seen in the housing market. But the fact that prices have been trending up all year and inventory levels have held at a healthy 6 months all year, at the same time that these foreclosures were being absorbed into the market, is a very good sign. Consistent with our announcement last February, our board changed the timing of its annual review of our dividend to the first quarter.
Earlier this morning, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which represents a 3.5% increase on an annual basis to $0.88 per share in 2012. The new dividend represents a 65% payout at the middle of our guidance range, consistent with the target payout ratio of 60% to 70% announced last year. Turning to our 2012 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share in 2012. This range allows for variations and factors such as weather at the utilities and production costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal.
In 2012, we expect both utilities to continue to earn within their respective ROE ranges. We expect customer growth to be in line with the trends we saw in 2011, with growth nearing the 1% level, and we assume normal weather. While we'll have to meet the challenge of higher depreciation from normal capital additions to serve customers, and pressure on pension and benefits costs before discount rates, the utilities will get the benefit of lower interest expense with the opportunity to refinance about $460 million of 2012 maturities in a low interest rate environment.
On the regulatory front, we will undertake the determination of need process for Tampa Electric's next increment of generation expansion, the Polk combined-cycle conversion that I described last quarter. In connection with this, we will begin the initial engineering work this year for the plant and transmission system upgrades to support the generation expansion. Peoples Gas capital spending this year will include several project to expand the system to supply commercial -- to supply economical and clean natural gas to large customers currently using petroleum or propane.
As described in our release last month, TECO Coal expects sales to be between 7.1 million and 7.3 million tons in 2012, at an average price of about $96 per ton, with about 50% of those sales going to the met, PCI and stoker coal markets. On the cost side, the fully loaded average production cost is expected to be in a range between $83 and $87 per ton. This takes into account the impact of higher selling prices, as well as spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. The $8 per ton increase in the average selling price this year adds almost $1 per ton to costs from royalties and severance taxes and spreading the same fixed costs over 1 million fewer tons affects costs by about $3 per ton. Our 2012 capital spending will include about $5 million for permitting an initial surface development related to the new met coal reserves that we told you about last November, to keep that activity moving forward while we continue to evaluate the specific market and mining plans.
The outlook for TECO Guatemala assumes normal operations at both power plants except for a scheduled turbine overhaul outage at the San José power plant, which we expect to reduce net income by about $4 million in 2012. I show you this next slide to illustrate the point that results in the coal business are driven by margins and not by volume. From 2008 to 2011, TECO Coal’s net income has almost tripled while volumes actually decreased by more than 1 million tons over the same timeframe.
Much of the margin expansion driving the slope of the net income line has come from a greater proportion of specialty coal in the sales mix. While that is also true in 2012, keep in mind that more than $3 a ton of the improvement in 2012 is attributable to the replacement of that significantly below market, 600,000-ton steam coal contracts You'll recall that we re-contracted those tons for 2012 in the second quarter of 2011 in a stronger steam coal market than we're seeing today. You can see here that coal sales are already pretty well contracted for 2012.
We are effectively sold-out on our steam coal and substantially all of our met coal is contracted as well. The unsold tons are primarily PCI tons. I'll close with our investor communication plans over the next several months. We expect to file our 10-K at the end of February and we'll be at the UBS conference in Dallas later that same week. In March, we'll be busy with the European Non-Deal Roadshow [ph] and we'll participate in the EEI Europe conference in London. We'll also be at the Morgan Stanley conference in New York that week.
And now, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for your questions."

Some of them a while in the making, some of them the result of looking hard at processes and approaches to things. But I'll give you an example. The costs associated with our long-term disability plan, which you record those costs under FAS 112, was substantially lower this year and that is driven completely by fewer people who are out on long-term disability. And that is a result of a very dedicated focus on safety, that's been in place for a long time and we're really beginning to see some of the benefits of that materialize, same thing on the workers comp side. So just good management of operations. Another small example is bad debt expense where, as you know, we have not seen the kinds of impacts from that, that some other companies in other parts of the country have. But that's now starting to trend down a little bit because we've managed that very effectively over the last couple of years.

As we have done in prior years, we're holding our first quarter call ahead of our shareholder meeting tomorrow. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and business drivers, a Florida economic update and then our outlook for the remainder of this year. 
In the first quarter, net income was $50.5 million or $0.24 a share compared to $31.7 million or $0.24 in 2011. There were no non-GAAP charges or gains in either year. 
I'll briefly highlight the quarter's drivers that were covered in our earnings release. At Tampa Electric, we had a full 1% customer growth in the first quarter. And that's the highest have seen since the first quarter of 2007. Tampa Electric's first quarter energy sales reflected an interesting weather mix. In the extremely mild winter of January and February, the heating degree days were half of what we would expect to see in those months. Fortunately, March was unusually hot and so cooling degree days were almost twice what we would normally see in March, although you are doubling a small number as it's not known as a month with much air-conditioning load. 
So overall, base revenues were up slightly from last year when the weather was mild throughout the quarter. And with normal increase in depreciation expense, that resulted in net income at about last year's first quarter. 
First quarter sales of Peoples Gas also reflected the mild weather in January and February and lower sales to residential and commercial customers. Unfortunately, people does not benefit from cooling degree days, so the weather impact was more pronounced on the gas company, resulting in net income lower than last year. 
Peoples did benefit from higher throughput for power generation customers, as gas-fired units ran more in response to the low natural gas prices. 
Peoples Gas also continues to experience steady customer growth, with an increase of 9/10 of a percent this quarter. 
Earnings at TECO Coal were higher this quarter, the result of margin expansion of $4 per ton. Sales volumes were lower than last year, as we projected they would be in January when we reduced our volume expectations in response to market condition. 
The average selling price for the quarter rose to $96 per ton. This reflects met coal prices contracted when the market was stronger and higher average steam coal prices, following the expiration of the below-market contract at the end of last year. The contracts replaced those tons were signed in the middle of 2011 in a more favorable pricing environment. 
The all-in cost of production was almost $87 per ton which is at the high end of our cost guidance range. The reason Q1 is at the high end is that January included cost associated with idling of facility and other actions we took to reduce production early this year. Compared to last year, production costs are higher because of higher royalty and severance fees which are a function of selling prices. The effective spread in fixed costs over fewer tons and higher cost to move coal and overburden further to work around the lack of new service mining permits. 
First quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was slightly higher than 2011. The San José power station realized higher prices on lower sales volumes compared to last year, as well as lower operating expenses. 
And TECO Energy parent had lower interest expense because of the debt we retired in May of last year. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains unchanged, in a range of between $1.30 and $1.40, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This range allows for variations in weather and customer usage at the utility and for cost in sales and volume at TECO Coal. 
Factors for the Florida utilities haven't changed. We expect to earn within our allowed ROE ranges at both companies which are 10.25% to 12.25% at Tampa Electric and 9.75% to 11.75% at Peoples. This outlook assumes normal weather for the rest of the year, continued economic recovery and customer growth for the year that will probably average a little lower than the  first quarter's growth. 
We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the local and state economy. This slide is a summary. But as Mark mentioned, there are charts and appendix that show graphically the positive trends noted here. 
Unemployment continues to decline in Florida. The March unemployment rate for the state was 9% and for Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area it was down to 8.5%, closing in on the 8.2% national rate. And I want to point out that this decline occurred during a period of labor force growth, so it's no shrinking labor force that's causing the unemployment rate to drop. 
Over the past 12 months, Florida has added 90,000 new jobs in the fields that are shown here on this slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 20,000 new jobs which is the second largest growth in the state. And consumers are spending more, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year for the 12 months ending in January. All in all, the trends are up and the outlook is for continued improvement. 
Trends are also positive in the housing market. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends expect 5% to 15% more new home starts in the Tampa area by the end of 2012 than we saw in 2011. According to Metrostudy, in the first quarter of 2012, there are more than 1,000 new home starts and that is up almost 27% from the first quarter of 2011. 
There's a graph in the appendix that shows new single-family building permits trending up consistent with Metrostudy's forecast. 
Existing home resales have remained strong, increasing 5% in the 12 months ended March 2012, compared to the same period last year. According to Moody's analytics, Tampa area housing is more affordable than its peers and it's not cheaper to rent than to own unlike some other areas of the state. 
The inventory of homes actively on the market attract by the greater Tampa association of realtors was well below the 6-month level considered a healthy market. And that's in stark contrast to the 25 months we saw at the deepest point of the downturn. 
And prices have held up well. After bottoming in early 2011, they have been improving pretty consistently. On a sequential month basis, which is different than the case Shiller year-over-year comparison, we have seen average selling prices increase in 8 of the last 12 months. 
Foreclosure activity in the Tampa area picked up in the first quarter in line with national trends, although down from a year ago. Now foreclosures in Florida involve court proceedings so it will take longer to work through the backlog than it will on some other states. 
TECO Coal expects sales of 7 million to 7.3 million tons this year. Only 10% of the expected sales are not contracted, but this open position has not changed since our last report. 
Based on customer needs, coal shipments for 2012 are more heavily weighted to the middle of the year than they have been in recent years. 
For 2012, we expect the average selling price to be more than $96 per ton, production cost to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton and the sales mix to be about 50% specialty coal, including met, PCI and Stoker coal. 
To date, our customers are taking their contracted time. When we reduced our sales expectations in January, some of the lower sales were due to customers differing some tons into 2013 and 2014. Including those deferrals, we now have more than 2.5 million tons of steam coal committed in price for 2013 at prices equivalent to the market at the middle of 2011. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José power station for much of the year, with perhaps some upside for spot sales from a drier-than-normal first quarter. Straddling the third and fourth quarters which are normally the rainy season with limited opportunities for spot sales, we will have an extended outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and have a small amount of incremental capacity which will help us with additional availability in a spot market in the future. 
And now I'll close with our investor communications plans over the next several months. As I mentioned to our shareholder meeting in Tampa. Next week, we will be at the ATA Spring financial conference in Scottsdale and look forward to seeing many of you there.  2 weeks later, we will be at the EEI spring meeting in New York. And in June, we will be traveling to meet with investors in the Midwest. 
And now, I can turn it over to the operator to open the lines to answer your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us this late in the day. As we've done in prior years, we're holding our first quarter call ahead of our shareholder meeting tomorrow.

As we've done in prior years, we're holding our first quarter call ahead of our shareholder meeting tomorrow. 
Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and business drivers, a Florida economic update and then our outlook for the remainder of this year. In the first quarter, net income was $50.5 million or $0.24 a share compared to $51.7 million or $0.24 in 2011. There were no non-GAAP charges or gains in either year. 
I'll briefly highlight the quarter's drivers that were covered on our earnings release. At Tampa Electric, we had a full 1% customer growth in the first quarter, and that's the highest we've seen since the first quarter of 2007. Tampa Electric's first quarter energy sales reflected an interesting weather mix. In the extremely mild winter of January and February, the heating degree days were half of what we would've expect to see in those months. Fortunately, March was unusually hot, and so cooling degree days were almost twice what we would normally see in March, although you're doubling a small number as it's not known as a month with much air-conditioning load. So overall, base revenues were up slightly from last year, when the weather was mild throughout the quarter, and with normal increase in depreciation expense, that resulted in net income at about last year's first quarter. 
First quarter therm sales at Peoples Gas also reflected the mild weather in January and February and lower sales to residential and commercial customers. Unfortunately, Peoples does not benefit from cooling degree days, so the weather impact was more pronounced on the gas company, resulting in net income lower than last year. Peoples did benefit from higher throughput for power generation customers, as gas-fired units ran more in response to the low natural gas prices. Peoples Gas also continues to experience steady customer growth, with an increase of 0.9% this quarter. 
Earnings at TECO Coal were higher this quarter, the result of margin expansion of $4 per ton. Sales volumes were lower than last year, as we projected they would be in January when we reduced our volume expectations in response to market condition. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $96 per ton. This reflects met coal prices contracted when the market was stronger and higher average steam coal prices, following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The contract to replace those tons was signed in the middle of 2011 in a more favorable pricing environment. 
The all-in cost of production was almost $87 per ton, which is at the high end of our cost guidance range. The reason Q1 is at the high end is that January included costs associated with idling a facility and other actions we took to reduce production early this year. Compared to last year, production costs are higher because of: higher royalty and severance fees, which are a function of selling prices; the effective spreading fixed costs over fewer tons; and higher cost to move coal and overburden further to work around the lack of new service mining permits. 
First quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was slightly higher than 2011. The San José Power Station realized higher prices on lower sales volumes compared to last year, as well as lower operating expenses. And TECO Energy parent had lower interest expense because of the debt we retired in May of last year. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains unchanged in a range of between $1.30 and $1.40, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This range allows for variations in weather and customer usage at the utility and for costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal. 
Factors for the Florida utilities haven't changed. We expect to earn within our allowed ROE ranges at both companies, which are 10.25% to 12.25% at Tampa Electric and 9.75% to 11.75% at Peoples. This outlook assumes normal weather for the rest of the year, continued economic recovery and customer growth for the year that will probably average a little lower than the first quarter's growth. 
We're encouraged by what we're seeing in the local and state economy. This slide is a summary. But as Mark mentioned, there are charts and appendix that show graphically the positive trends noted here. 
Unemployment continues to decline in Florida. The March unemployment rate for the state was 9%, and for Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, it was down to 8.5%, closing in on the 8.2% national rate. And I want to point out that this decline occurred during a period of labor force growth, so it's no shrinking labor force that's causing the unemployment rate to drop. 
Over the past 12 months, Florida has added 90,000 new jobs in the fields that are shown here on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 20,000 new jobs, which is the second largest growth in the state, and consumers are spending more, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year for the 12 months ending in January. All in all, the trends are up and the outlook is for continued improvement. 
Trends are also positive in the housing market. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends, expect 5% to 15% more new home starts in the Tampa area by the end of 2012 than we saw in 2011. According to Metrostudy, in the first quarter of 2012, there are more than 1,000 new home starts, and that's up almost 27% from the first quarter of 2011. There's a graph in the appendix that shows new single-family building permits trending up consistent with Metrostudy's forecast. 
Existing home resales have remained strong, increasing 5% in the 12 months ended March 2012, compared to the same period last year. According to Moody's Analytics, Tampa area housing is more affordable than its peers, and it's not cheaper to rent than to own unlike some other areas of the state. The inventory of homes actively on the market, as tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of REALTORS, was well below the 6-month level considered a healthy market, and that's in stark contrast to the 25 months we saw at the deepest point of the downturn. 
And prices have held up well. After bottoming in early 2011, they have been improving pretty consistently. On a sequential-month basis, which is different than the Case-Shiller year-over-year comparison, we have seen average selling prices increase in 8 of the last 12 months. 
Foreclosure activity in the Tampa area picked up in the first quarter in line with national trends, although down from a year ago. Now foreclosures in Florida involve court proceedings, so it will take longer to work through the backlog than it will on some other states. 
TECO Coal expects sales of 7 million to 7.3 million tons this year. Only 10% of the expected sales are not contracted, but this open position has not changed since our last report. Based on customer needs, coal shipments for 2012 are more heavily weighted to the middle of the year than they have been in recent years. For 2012, we expect the average selling price to be more than $96 per ton, production cost to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton and the sales mix to be about 50% specialty coal, including met, PCI and stoker coal. 
To date, our customers are taking their contracted tons. When we reduced our sales expectations in January, some of the lower sales were due to customers deferring some tons into 2013 and 2014. Including those deferrals, we now have more than 2.5 million tons of steam coal committed in price for 2013 at prices equivalent to the market at the middle of 2011. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José Power Station for much of the year, with perhaps some upside for spot sales from a drier-than-normal first quarter. Straddling the third and fourth quarters, which are normally the rainy season with limited opportunities for spot sales, we will have an extended outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and have a small amount of incremental capacity, which will help us with additional availability in the spot market in the future. 
And now, I'll close with our investor communications' plans over the next several months. As I mentioned, tomorrow is our annual shareholder meeting in Tampa. Next week, we will be at the AGA Spring Financial conference in Scottsdale and look forward to seeing many of you there. Two weeks later, we will be at the EEI Spring meeting in New York, and in June, we will be traveling to meet with investors in the Midwest. 
And now, I can turn it over to the operator to open the line to answer your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us this late in the day. As we've done in prior years, we're holding our first quarter call ahead of our shareholder meeting tomorrow. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and b",1503,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us this late in the day. As we've done in prior years, we're holding our first quarter call ahead of our shareholder meeting tomorrow. 
Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and business drivers, a Florida economic update and then our outlook for the remainder of this year. In the first quarter, net income was $50.5 million or $0.24 a share compared to $51.7 million or $0.24 in 2011. There were no non-GAAP charges or gains in either year. 
I'll briefly highlight the quarter's drivers that were covered in our earnings release. At Tampa Electric, we had a full 1% customer growth in the first quarter, and that's the highest we've seen since the first quarter of 2007. Tampa Electric's first quarter energy sales reflected an interesting weather mix. In the extremely mild winter of January and February, the heating degree days were half of what we would expect to see in those months. Fortunately, March was unusually hot, and so cooling degree days were almost twice what we would normally see in March, although you're doubling a small number as it's not known as a month with much air-conditioning load. So overall, base revenues were up slightly from last year, when the weather was mild throughout the quarter, and with normal increase in depreciation expense, that resulted in net income at about last year's first quarter. 
First quarter therm sales at Peoples Gas also reflected the mild weather in January and February and lower sales to residential and commercial customers. Unfortunately, Peoples does not benefit from cooling degree days, so the weather impact was more pronounced on the gas company, resulting in net income lower than last year. Peoples did benefit from higher throughput for power generation customers, as gas-fired units ran more in response to the low natural gas prices. Peoples Gas also continues to experience steady customer growth, with an increase of 0.9% this quarter. 
Earnings at TECO Coal were higher this quarter, the result of margin expansion of $4 per ton. Sales volumes were lower than last year, as we projected they would be in January when we reduced our volume expectations in response to market condition. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $96 per ton. This reflects met coal prices contracted when the market was stronger and higher average steam coal prices, following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The contract to replace those tons was signed in the middle of 2011 in a more favorable pricing environment. 
The all-in cost of production was almost $87 per ton, which is at the high end of our cost guidance range. The reason Q1 is at the high end is that January included costs associated with idling a facility and other actions we took to reduce production early this year. Compared to last year, production costs are higher because of: higher royalty and severance fees, which are a function of selling prices; the effective spreading fixed costs over fewer tons; and higher cost to move coal and overburden further to work around the lack of new service mining permits. 
First quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was slightly higher than 2011. The San José Power Station realized higher prices on lower sales volumes compared to last year, as well as lower operating expenses. And TECO Energy parent had lower interest expense because of the debt we retired in May of last year. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains unchanged at a range of between $1.30 and $1.40, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This range allows for variations in weather and customer usage at the utilities and for costs and sales volumes at TECO Coal. 
Factors for the Florida utilities haven't changed. We expect to earn within our allowed ROE ranges at both companies, which are 10.25% to 12.25% at Tampa Electric and 9.75% to 11.75% at Peoples. This outlook assumes normal weather for the rest of the year, continued economic recovery and customer growth for the year that will probably average a little lower than the first quarter's growth. 
We're encouraged by what we're seeing in the local and state economy. This slide is a summary, but as Mark mentioned, there are charts in the appendix that show graphically the positive trends noted here. 
Unemployment continues to decline in Florida. The March unemployment rate for the state was 9%, and for Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, it was down to 8.5%, closing in on the 8.2% national rate. And I want to point out that this decline occurred during a period of labor force growth, so it's another shrinking labor force that's causing the unemployment rate to drop. 
Over the past 12 months, Florida has added 90,000 new jobs in the fields that are shown here on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 20,000 new jobs, which is the second largest growth in the state, and consumers are spending more, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year for the 12 months ending in January. All in all, the trends are up and the outlook is for continued improvement. 
Trends are also positive in the housing market. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends, expect 5% to 15% more new home starts in the Tampa area by the end of 2012 than we saw in 2011. According to Metrostudy, in the first quarter of 2012, there are more than 1,000 new home starts, and that's up almost 27% from the first quarter of 2011. There's a graph in the appendix that shows new single-family building permits trending up consistent with Metrostudy's forecast. 
Existing home resales have remained strong, increasing 5% in the 12 months ended March 2012, compared to the same period last year. According to Moody's Analytics, Tampa area housing is more affordable than its peers, and it's not cheaper to rent than to own, unlike some other areas of the state. The inventory of homes actively on the market, as tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of REALTORS, was well below the 6-month level considered a healthy market, and that's in stark contrast to the 25 months we saw at the deepest point of the downturn. 
And prices have held up well. After bottoming in early 2011, they have been improving pretty consistently. On a sequential-month basis, which is different than the Case-Shiller year-over-year comparison, we have seen average selling prices increase in 8 of the last 12 months. 
Foreclosure activity in the Tampa area picked up in the first quarter in line with national trends, although down from a year ago. Now foreclosures in Florida involve court proceedings, so it will take longer to work through the backlog than it will on some other states. 
TECO Coal expects sales of 7 million to 7.3 million tons this year. Only 10% of the expected sales are not contracted, but this open position has not changed since our last report. Based on customer needs, coal shipments for 2012 are more heavily weighted to the middle of the year than they have been in recent years. For 2012, we expect the average selling price to be more than $96 per ton, production cost to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton and the sales mix to be about 50% specialty coal, including met, PCI and stoker coal. 
To date, our customers are taking their contracted tons. When we reduced our sales expectations in January, some of the lower sales were due to customers deferring some tons into 2013 and 2014. Including those deferrals, we now have more than 2.5 million tons of steam coal committed in price for 2013 at prices equivalent to the market at the middle of 2011. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José Power Station for much of the year, with perhaps some upside for spot sales from a drier-than-normal first quarter. Straddling the third and fourth quarters, which are normally the rainy season, with limited opportunities for spot sales, we will have an extended outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and to have a small amount of incremental capacity, which will help us with additional availability in the spot market in the future. 
And now, I'll close with our investor communications' plans over the next several months. As I mentioned, tomorrow is our annual shareholder meeting in Tampa. Next week, we will be at the AGA Spring Financial conference in Scottsdale and look forward to seeing many of you there. Two weeks later, we will be at the EEI Spring meeting in New York, and in June, we will be traveling to meet with investors in the Midwest. 
And now, I can turn it over to the operator to open the line to answer your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us and another busy day for utility earnings report. I understand that there are at least 10 companies releasing today, so I'll keep my remarks brief. I'll cover second quarter results, lo",2081,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us and another busy day for utility earnings report. I understand that there are at least 10 companies releasing today, so I'll keep my remarks brief. I'll cover second quarter results, local and state economic indicators and our advised guidance for this year. 
In the second quarter, net income was $73.1 million or $0.34 a share compared with $77.5 million or $0.36 in 2011. On a year-to-date basis, net income in 2012 was $123.6 million or $0.58 a share compared with $129.2 million or $0.60 last year. 
The most significant factor impacting the year-over-year comparisons in both the quarter and 6 months was the effect of milder weather on electric sales. 
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter despite having had the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since it began to turn at the end of 2009, customer growth has been on a solid trend up. And for the second quarter this year, reached 1.3%. 
Retail net energy for load in the second quarter was 2.3% lower than last year. Total degree days were 6% below last year, primarily due to a wet and mild month of June, including the effects of tropical storm, Debbie, the last week of the month. This negatively impacted sales to residential customers, although commercial and industrial sales were up. 
Tampa Electric also had higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth had reached 1.2% in the second quarter. Weather isn't a factor in the second quarter gas consumption. And we saw a firm sales increase in every retail segment, residential, commercial and industrial, as the Florida economy continues to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M expense in the quarter compared with last year. 
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal's results for the quarter reflected higher margin, but lower sales volume from last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $94 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was strong and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. 
The second quarter price was below the $96 average price expected for the full year, as the sales mix this quarter was more heavily weighted to steam coal due to the timing of metallurgical coal shipments which will occur in the second half of the year. 
The all-in cost of production was $84 per ton, just below the middle of the cost guidance range, after experiencing higher first quarter cost associated with idling some facilities in that quarter. 
TECO Coal had been successful with its cost control action to offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
Second quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was higher than 2011, reflecting higher contract and spot sales volume and lower operating expenses. 
Other positive impacts, although smaller include higher earnings from the TECO's gas pipeline that serves Jacksonville Electric and lower parent interest. 
We are revising our earnings per share guidance for the year to a range between $1.20 and $1.30, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This revision is due to the effects of the mild year-to-date weather on Tampa Electric and the expectation that the unsold tons included in our original projections at TECO Coal will not be sold this year. 
This range allows for some variation in weather and customer usage at the utility and per cost and the timing of contracted shipments at TECO Coal. 
The primary factor driving Tampa Electric's outlook is the year-to-date effect of the unfavorable weather on residential revenues. The rainy weather that hurt June continued into July as well. As a result of the lower residential revenues, we expect Tampa Electric will earn near the bottom of it's allowed ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. 
Peoples Gas, because of the rates [ph] implemented in its 2009 rate decision is less weather and volume sensitive and should be able to earn at or above the middle of it's allowed 9.75% to 11.75% ROE. 
Our outlook has been customer growth generally continues in line with the year-to-date trends at both utilities and that weather for the remaining 5 months of the year is normal. The outlook also assumes that the current economic and housing market conditions in Florida generally continue and doesn't contemplate a major economic slowdown. 
So now turning to what we have been seeing in the local and state economies. If you're interested in seeing graphically some of the trends I'll be discussing, there are some graphs in the appendix that do that. 
The unemployment rate in the state continue to improve in the quarter until leveling off in June unchanged from May at 8.6%. As a point of reference, it was 9% at the end of March and was 10.7% only a year ago. 
The civilian workforce continues to expand, up four-tenths of a percent over the past year and the number of those employed statewide is up 2.7% compared with last year. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, unemployment also improved early in the quarter, declining from 8.5% in March to 8.4% in May. In June though it ticked up to 8.8%, a seasonal pattern we've observed in prior years when the school systems close in May and schoolbus drivers and other school system employees are off for the summer. 
Over the last 12 months, Florida has added almost 71,000 new jobs in the field shown on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 23,000 new jobs which is the strongest growth in any of the major metropolitan areas in the state. It's possible that employment in the Tampa area is benefiting from increased hiring ahead of the Republican national convention which will be held in Tampa the last week of August. 
And the final point on this slide, consumers are spending more in general, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year in the 12 months ended in June. 
The housing market also continues to improve. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends expect new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than in 2011. And the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. You can see on the building permit graph in the appendix that new single-family building permits are trending up, with a very strong start to the summer. 
Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market. And there are even published reports out of South Florida of a resumption of condo tower construction. 
Growth in existing home resales continued, with resale in the 12 months ended June 2012 climbing 6% compared with the same period last year. The inventory of homes actively on the market as is tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors was actually below 4 months at the end of June. At the end of March, it was 6 months which already was considered a healthy market. 
The average home resale price bottomed in early 2011 and has been increasing pretty consistently since then. The average selling price in the 12 months that ended in June was 3% higher than the comparable period a year ago. 
Like other areas of the country, we've seen a higher level of foreclosures in the Tampa area this year, presumably as the banks have gotten past redocumentation issue. Foreclosure spiked in February through May. But by June, had declined to previous levels. 
The percentage increase was high. But to put it into practical perspective, the volume increased during that spike was the equivalent in total of about 1 month of housing resales activity. So as resale inventory at its current low level, it doesn't appear that the foreclosure spike we saw is likely to cause a major disruption. 
So overall, what we've seen recently in the state and local economy and housing market has continued to be positive. 
For TECO Coal, we've revised our sales forecast, down to a range of 6 to 6.3 million tons this year, based on the expectation that the roughly 10% of sales that were uncontracted at the end of the first quarter will not be sold this year. We are fully contracted at 6.3 million tons. So the range simply recognizes the potential variability of delivery schedule. 
The sales mix is now expected to be about 45% net PCI in stoker coal since the unsold tons included PCI and some lower-grade of met coal. 
For the year, the average selling price is expected to be slightly less than the $96 per ton and the production cost is still expected to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton for the year. We expect a somewhat higher average selling price of $97 for the second half, as some shipments of specialty coal have shifted into the second half of the year based on customer requests. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José power station for the remainder of the year until the fourth quarter when we will have an extended planned outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect to turbine to have a better heat rate and to have a small amount of incremental capacity which will be available for sale in the spot market. 
Although the impact of the outage is minimized because it happens in the fourth quarter when hydro plant availability reduces the opportunity for spot sales anyway, it will impact results about $4 million compared to 2011. 
The challenging coal market and issues that some other coal producers have heightened interest among some investors regarding our outlook for TECO Coal beyond this year and surface and misconceptions about the coal business. So before I close, I would like to address a few of these. 
First, TECO Coal is margin driven and not volume driven. Our future production in sales will be based on market conditions and per ton profitability. Will what the market demand and is willing to pay an appropriate price for it. This means that we can't provide an outlook on future volume until we see what the market is. 
For 2013, we already have 2.5 million tons of thermal coal, contracted and priced in the range of $75 to $82 per ton. At this volume level, we're in pretty good shape for thermal coal sales for 2013. For various reasons, including more surface sources, less washing, less depth, thermal coal cost less to mine than met coal and are profitable at these prices. 
We haven't priced our met coal for 2013 yet, as the normal contract cycle for domestic met coal is late third quarter or early fourth quarter. And for the past several years, we have been selling most of our met coal domestically. 
For 2014, we have 1.2 million tons of thermal coal contracted and priced above $80 per ton. We would like to get more thermal coal contracted for 2014. But the good news is that we have a year and a half to get it done and futures prices indicate an expectation of some market strengthening in 2013. 
To put some perspective on what we have invested in the coal business. At year end, our investment in mines equipment and reserves, net of depreciation was only about $200 million. And we don't have significant legacy liabilities. We are a nonunion operation, with benefits programs that are similar to the other TECO Energy company. There's no debt specific to TECO Coal. And the reclamation liabilities for deep mines and preparation plants were about $20 million at year end. While the surface mine reclamation is done primarily as a current operating expense as we mine. 
In short, over the years, we've invested moderately in this business and have managed it conservatively. As a result, we've earned strong results in our investment and limited our financial exposure. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communication activity. In September, we'll be meeting with investors on the East Coast in the mid-Atlantic and Boston areas. And the following week, we will be in New York at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference. And now I'll turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

First of all, the electric company we are seeing, our natural gas which are highly efficient combined cycle units competing more with the coal companies for dispatch. And we are traditionally the coal units would handle all of the baseload and the gas would kick in intermediate. The gas units are competitive more and they're running more. And I think probably the utilities all over have seen that change in their mix a little bit. It has helped to keep customers' overall cost down. Because the fuel cost in our rates as they down. At the gas company, putting aside weather and the mild winter we had, we're seeing expected a strong use of our customers. But we're also seeing more and more customers wanting to switch from petroleum-based BTUs to natural gas BTUs because, not only the current price differential, but expected future price differential. We are building a significant pipeline to industrial customer up in the Northeast area for that purpose there are going to be using natural gas in their operations rather than petroleum and other products moving ahead. We've seen the same type of interest from other businesses like Wisconsin and plants and things like that and other industrial processes. And of course, very, very significant interest from those that operate fleets of vehicles and converting their petroleum-based product vehicle fleets to compressed natural gas. And we've been in that process for about a year and a half and we have things under way. And about another year, we will have helped our customers put in enough compressed natural gas fleets to maybe the equivalent of serving about 27,000 new homes with natural gas that we're seeing a lot of interest in that area. The negative effect we've seen from natural gas prices has been in the coal business and has been reported broadly in the industry that has reduced utility consumption of coal which has left them with higher inventories. And so utilities are not buying as much coal and that's the biggest negative effect we see from the natural gas prices. But as Sandy said earlier, we're in the fortunate position of have timed our contracts for steam coal such that we contracted in a pretty positive period and have nice contracts for this year, next year and 2014. Prices that we can make a good reasonable steam coal margin on. Sandy, do you have anything to that?"

Even though we hedged the diesel prices with the lack of surface permitting we're extending jobs and transporting product further. And over time, we've gone from about a gallon and a half per ton of coal and diesel to closer to $2 per ton of coal. So that had upward pressure. Natural gas prices have been down, which is helpful on explosives, but ammonia prices were up which goes the other way and diesel prices all directly hedge at the rate I talked about earlier. It still affects other things like the lubricants and those kinds of things. On the other side, there's a little bit and have immediately the potential relief of labor cost and the markets have been softer. And as we shift in production and move production less overtime, less contractors and that has been helpful and allowed us to control the cost of the levels that we have. So it's a mixed bag of upward and downward pressures, but our objective is to keep it down obviously."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us and another busy day for utility earnings reports.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us and another busy day for utility earnings reports. I understand that there are at least 10 companies releasing today, so I'll keep my remarks brief. I'll cover second quarter results, local and state economic indicators and our advised guidance for this year. 
In the second quarter, net income was $73.1 million or $0.34 a share, compared with $77.5 million or $0.36 in 2011. On a year-to-date basis, net income in 2012 was $123.6 million or $0.58 a share compared with $129.2 million or $0.60 last year. The most significant factor impacting the year-over-year comparisons, in both the quarter and 6 months, were the effect of milder weather on electric sales. 
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter, despite having had the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since it began to turn at the end of 2009, customer growth has been on a solid trend up. And for the second quarter this year, reached 1.3%. 
Retail net energy for load in the second quarter was 2.3% lower than last year. Total degree days were 6% below last year, primarily due to a wet and mild month of June, including the effects of Tropical Storm Debby the last week of the month. This negatively impacted sales to residential customers, although commercial and industrial sales were up.  Tampa Electric also had higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth had reached 1.2% in the second quarter. Weather isn't a factor in the second quarter gas consumption. And we saw a firm sales increase in every retail segment, residential, commercial and industrial, as the Florida economy continues to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M expense in the quarter compared with last year. 
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal's results for the quarter reflected higher margin, but lower sales volume from last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $94 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was strong and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The second quarter price was below the $96 average price expected for the full year, as the sales mix this quarter was more heavily weighted to steam coal due to the timing of metallurgical coal shipments which will occur in the second half of the year.  
The all-in cost of production was $84 per ton, just below the middle of the cost guidance range, after experiencing higher first quarter cost associated with idling some facilities in that quarter. TECO Coal has been successful with its cost control action to offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
Second quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was higher than 2011, reflecting higher contract and spot sales volume and lower operating expenses.  Other positive impacts, although smaller, include higher earnings from the TECO's gas pipeline that serves Jacksonville Electric and lower parent interest. 
We are revising our earnings per share guidance for the year to a range between $1.20 and $1.30, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This revision is due to the effects of the mild year-to-date weather on Tampa Electric, and the expectation that the unsold tons included in our original projections at TECO Coal will not be sold this year. This range allows for some variation in weather and customer usage of the utility and per cost and the timing of contracted shipments at TECO Coal. 
The primary factor driving Tampa Electric's outlook is the year-to-date effect of the unfavorable weather on residential revenues. The rainy weather that hurt June continued into July as well. As a result of the lower residential revenues, we expect Tampa Electric will earn near the bottom of it's allowed ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. 
Peoples Gas, because of the rate design implemented in its 2009 rate decision, is less weather and volume sensitive and should be able to earn at or above the middle of it's allowed 9.75% to 11.75% ROE. 
Our outlook assumes that customer growth generally continues in line with the year-to-date trends at both utilities, and that weather for the remaining 5 months of the year is normal. The outlook also assumes that the current economic and housing market conditions in Florida generally continue and doesn't contemplate a major economic slowdown. 
So now turning to what we have been seeing in the local and state economies. If you're interested in seeing graphically some of the trends I'll be discussing, there are some graphs in the appendix that do that. The unemployment rate in the state continue to improve in the quarter until leveling off in June, unchanged from May at 8.6%. As a point of reference, it was 9% at the end of March and was 10.7% only a year ago. The civilian workforce continues to expand, up 0.4% over the past year. And the number of those employed statewide is up 2.7% compared with last year. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, unemployment also improved early in the quarter, declining from 8.5% in March to 8.4% in May. In June though, it ticked up to 8.8%, a seasonal pattern we've observed in prior years when the school systems close in May and school bus drivers and other school system employees are off for the summer. 
Over the last 12 months, Florida has added almost 71,000 new jobs in the field shown on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 23,000 new jobs, which is the strongest growth in any of the major metropolitan areas in the state. It's possible that employment in the Tampa area is benefiting from increased hiring ahead of the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Tampa the last week of August. And the final point on this slide, consumers are spending more in general, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year in the 12 months ended in June. 
The housing market also continues to improve. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends expect new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than in 2011. And the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. You can see on the building permit graph in the appendix that new single-family building permits are trending up, with a very strong start to the summer. 
Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market. And there are even published reports out of South Florida of a resumption of condo tower construction. Growth in existing home resales continued, with resale in the 12 months ended June 2012, climbing 6% compared with the same period last year. The inventory of homes actively on the market, as is tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of REALTORS, was actually below 4 months at the end of June. At the end of March, it was 6 months, which already was considered a healthy market.  
The average home resale price bottomed in early 2011 and has been increasing pretty consistently since then. The average selling price in the 12 months that ended in June was 3% higher than the comparable period a year ago. Like other areas of the country, we've seen a higher level of foreclosures in the Tampa area this year, presumably as the banks have gotten past their documentation issue. 
Foreclosures spiked in February through May. But by June, had declined to previous levels. The percentage increase was high. But to put it into practical perspective, the volume increased during that spike was the equivalent, in total, of about 1 month of housing resales activity. So as resale inventory at its current low level, it doesn't appear that the foreclosure spike we saw is likely to cause a major disruption. 
So overall, what we've seen recently in the state and local economies and housing market has continued to be positive. 
For TECO Coal, we've revised our sales forecast, down to a range of 6 million to 6.3 million tons this year, based on the expectation that the roughly 10% of sales that were uncontracted at the end of the first quarter will not be sold this year. We are fully contracted at 6.3 million tons. So the range simply recognizes the potential variability of delivery schedule. The sales mix is now expected to be about 45% net PCI and stoker coals, since the unsold tons included PCI and some lower grades of met coal. 
For the year, the average selling price is expected to be slightly less than the $96 per ton, and the production cost is still expected to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton for the year. We expect a somewhat higher average selling price of $97 for the second half, as some shipments of specialty coal have shifted into the second half of the year based on customer requests. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José Power Station for the remainder of the year until the fourth quarter, when we will have an extended planned outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and to have a small amount of incremental capacity, which will be available for sale in the spot market. Although the impact of the outage is minimized because it happens in the fourth quarter when hydro plant availability reduces the opportunity for spot sales anyway, it will impact results about $4 million compared to 2011. 
The challenging coal market and issues at some other coal producers, have heightened interest among some investors regarding our outlook for TECO Coal beyond this year and have surfaced some misconceptions about the coal business. So before I close, I would like to address a few of these. 
First, TECO Coal is margin driven and not volume driven. Our future production in sales will be based on market conditions and per ton profitability. Will mind what the market demand and is willing to pay an appropriate price for it. This means that we can't provide an outlook on future volume until we see what the market is. 
For 2013, we already have 2.5 million tons of thermal coal, contracted and priced in the range of $75 to $82 per ton. At this volume level, we're in pretty good shape for thermal coal sales for 2013.  For various reasons, including more surface sources, less washing, less depth, thermal coal cost less to mine than met coal, and are profitable at these prices. We haven't priced our met coal for 2013 yet, as the normal contract cycle for domestic met coal is late third quarter or early fourth quarter. And for the past several years, we have been selling most of our met coal domestically. 
For 2014, we have 1.2 million tons of thermal coal contracted and priced above $80 per ton. We would like to get more thermal coal contracted for 2014, but the good news is that we have 1.5 year to get it done and future prices indicate an expectation of some market strengthening in 2013. 
To put some perspective on what we have invested in the coal business. At year end, our investment in mines equipment and reserves, net of depreciation was only about $200 million. And we don't have significant legacy liabilities. We're a nonunion operation, with benefits programs that are similar to the other TECO Energy companies. There's no debt specific to TECO Coal. And the reclamation liabilities for deep mines and preparation plants were about $20 million at year end. While the surface mine reclamation is done primarily as a current operating expense as we mine. 
In short, over the years, we've invested moderately in this business and have managed it conservatively. As a result, we've earned strong returns on our investment and limited our financial exposure. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communication activity. In September, we'll be meeting with investors on the East Coast in the mid-Atlantic and Boston areas. And the following week, we will be in New York at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investor Conference. And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

First of all, at the electric company, we are seeing our natural gas units, which are highly efficient combined cycle units, competing more with the coal companies for dispatch. And where, traditionally, the coal units would handle all of the baseload and then the gas would kick in intermediate. The gas units are competitive and they're running more. And I think, probably, utilities all over have seen that change in their mix a little bit. It's helped to keep customers' overall cost down because the fuel cost, confident of our rate, has stayed down. At the gas company, putting aside weather and the mild winter we had, we're seeing -- expected a strong use by our customers. But we're also seeing more and more customers wanting to switch from petroleum-based BTUs to natural gas BTUs because of, not only the current price differential, but expected future price differential. We are building a significant pipeline to an industrial customer up in the Northeast Florida area for just that purpose. They're going to be using natural gas in their operations rather than petroleum and other products moving ahead. We've seen the same type of interest from other businesses like nurseries or plants and things like that and other industrial processes. And of course, very, very significant interest from those that operate fleets of vehicles and converting their petroleum-based product vehicle fleets to compressed natural gas. And we've been in that process for about 1.5 year and we have things underway. And in about another year, we will have helped our customers put in enough compressed natural gas fleets to maybe an equivalent of serving about 27,000 new homes with natural gas. So we're seeing a lot of interest in that area. The negative effect we've seen from natural gas prices has been in the coal business and has been reported broadly in the industry that has reduced utility consumption of coal, which has left them with higher inventories. And so utilities are not buying as much coal and that's the biggest negative effect we see from the natural gas prices. But as Sandy said earlier, we're in the fortunate position of have timed our contracts for steam coal, such that we contracted in a pretty positive period and have nice contracts for this year, next year and 2014 at prices that we can make a good reasonable steam coal margin on. Sandy, do you have anything to that?"

When we talked about -- we came out of our last rate case, we talked about our desire to stay out of rate cases and we needed some things to happen and one of them was to stay on our program to be efficient and we'll continue to do that. The other is we need to get the customer growth back up to the longer term expected 1%, 1.5% customer growth and that is starting to happen, but it slack. It's been a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we're getting closer to that. And we also talked about, hopefully, we don't have weather hurting us.

And we think we can throttle up and down a fair amount and still remain profitable. As long as there's some reasonable pricing in the market. And we've shown that. One of the things, although we're not pleased with the numbers coming out of our coal company, on a relative basis, I think we're doing okay. And the thing I'm most pleased about is the success we're having in controlling our cost. We have spread fixed costs over fewer tons this year and that's been a challenge. But other than the early part of the year, January and February, as we transition from a little bit of a restructuring and a reduction in tons, our team there has been beating their targets on cost per ton. And they're focused on that and we're going to continue to do that moving ahead. And hopefully, stay on that bottom half of the range we provided."

Even though we hedged the diesel prices with the lack of surface permitting we're extending jobs and transporting product further. And over time, we've gone from about 1.5 gallon per ton of coal diesel to closer to $2 per ton of coal. So that had upward pressure. Natural gas prices have been down, which is helpful on explosives. But ammonia prices were up, which goes the other way. And diesel prices although directly we hedge it, at the rate I talked about earlier, it still affects other things like the lubricants and belting and those types of things. On the other side, I think there's a little bit -- it didn't happen immediately, but potential relief on labor cost as the markets have been softer. And as we shift in production and move production less overtime, less contractors and that's been helpful in allowing us to control the cost of the levels that we have. So it's a mixed bag of upward and downward pressures, but our objective is to keep it down, obviously."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on another busy day for utility earnings reports.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on another busy day for utility earnings reports. I understand that there are at least 10 companies releasing today, so I'll keep my remarks brief. I'll cover second quarter results, local and state economic indicators and our revised guidance for this year. 
In the second quarter, net income was $73.1 million or $0.34 a share, compared with $77.5 million or $0.36 in 2011. On a year-to-date basis, net income in 2012 was $123.6 million or $0.58 a share compared with $129.2 million or $0.60 last year. The most significant factor impacting the year-over-year comparisons, in both the quarter and 6 months, were the effect of milder weather on electric sales. 
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter, despite having had the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since it began to turn at the end of 2009, customer growth has been on a solid trend up. And for the second quarter this year, reached 1.3%. 
Retail net energy for load in the second quarter was 2.3% lower than last year. Total degree days were 6% below last year, primarily due to a wet and mild month of June, including the effects of Tropical Storm Debby the last week of the month. This negatively impacted sales to residential customers, although commercial and industrial sales were up.  Tampa Electric also had higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth had reached 1.2% in the second quarter. Weather isn't a factor in the second quarter gas consumption. And we saw a firm sales increase in every retail segment, residential, commercial and industrial, as the Florida economy continues to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M expense in the quarter compared with last year. 
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal's results for the quarter reflected higher margin, but lower sales volume from last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $94 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was strong and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The second quarter price was below the $96 average price expected for the full year, as the sales mix this quarter was more heavily weighted to steam coal due to the timing of metallurgical coal shipments which will occur in the second half of the year.  
The all-in cost of production was $84 per ton, just below the middle of the cost guidance range, after experiencing higher first quarter cost associated with idling some facilities in that quarter. TECO Coal has been successful with its cost control action to offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
Second quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was higher than 2011, reflecting higher contract and spot sales volume and lower operating expenses.  Other positive impacts, although smaller, include higher earnings from the TECO's gas pipeline that serves Jacksonville Electric and lower parent interest. 
We are revising our earnings per share guidance for the year to a range between $1.20 and $1.30, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This revision is due to the effects of the mild year-to-date weather on Tampa Electric, and the expectation that the unsold tons included in our original projections at TECO Coal will not be sold this year. This range allows for some variation in weather and customer usage at the utility and for cost and the timing of contracted shipments at TECO Coal. 
The primary factor driving Tampa Electric's outlook is the year-to-date effect of the unfavorable weather on residential revenues. The rainy weather that hurt June continued into July as well. As a result of the lower residential revenues, we expect Tampa Electric will earn near the bottom of it's allowed ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. 
Peoples Gas, because of the rate design implemented in its 2009 rate decision, is less weather and volume sensitive and should be able to earn at or above the middle of it's allowed 9.75% to 11.75% ROE. 
Our outlook assumes that customer growth generally continues in line with the year-to-date trends at both utilities, and that weather for the remaining 5 months of the year is normal. The outlook also assumes that the current economic and housing market conditions in Florida generally continue and doesn't contemplate a major economic slowdown. 
So now turning to what we have been seeing in the local and state economies. If you're interested in seeing graphically some of the trends I'll be discussing, there are some graphs in the appendix that do that. The unemployment rate in the state continued to improve in the quarter until leveling off in June, unchanged from May at 8.6%. As a point of reference, it was 9% at the end of March and was 10.7% only a year ago. The civilian workforce continues to expand, up 0.4% over the past year. And the number of those employed statewide is up 2.7% compared with last year. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, unemployment also improved early in the quarter, declining from 8.5% in March to 8.4% in May. In June though, it ticked up to 8.8%, a seasonal pattern we've observed in prior years when the school systems close in May and school bus drivers and other school system employees are off for the summer. 
Over the last 12 months, Florida has added almost 71,000 new jobs in the field shown on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 23,000 new jobs, which is the strongest growth in any of the major metropolitan areas in the state. It's possible that employment in the Tampa area is benefiting from increased hiring ahead of the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Tampa the last week of August. And the final point on this slide, consumers are spending more in general, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year in the 12 months ended in June. 
The housing market also continues to improve. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends expect new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than in 2011. And the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. You can see on the building permit graph in the appendix that new single-family building permits are trending up, with a very strong start to the summer. 
Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market. And there are even published reports out of South Florida of a resumption of condo tower construction. Growth in existing home resales continued, with resales in the 12 months ended June 2012, climbing 6% compared with the same period last year. The inventory of homes actively on the market, as is tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of REALTORS, was actually below 4 months at the end of June. At the end of March, it was 6 months, which already was considered a healthy market.  
The average home resale price bottomed in early 2011 and has been increasing pretty consistently since then. The average selling price in the 12 months that ended in June was 3% higher than the comparable period a year ago. Like other areas of the country, we've seen a higher level of foreclosures in the Tampa area this year, presumably as the banks have gotten past their documentation issue. 
Foreclosures spiked in February through May. But by June, had declined to previous levels. The percentage increase was high. But to put it into a practical perspective, the volume increase during that spike was the equivalent, in total, of about 1 month of housing resales activity. So as resale inventory at its current low level, it doesn't appear that the foreclosure spike we saw is likely to cause a major disruption. 
So overall, what we've seen recently in the state and local economies and housing markets has continued to be positive. 
For TECO Coal, we've revised our sales forecast, down to a range of 6 million to 6.3 million tons this year, based on the expectation that the roughly 10% of sales that were uncontracted at the end of the first quarter will not be sold this year. We are fully contracted at 6.3 million tons. So the range simply recognizes the potential variability of delivery schedule. The sales mix is now expected to be about 45% net PCI and stoker coals, since the unsold tons included PCI and some lower grades of met coal. 
For the year, the average selling price is expected to be slightly less than the $96 per ton, and the production cost is still expected to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton for the year. We expect a somewhat higher average selling price of $97 for the second half, as some shipments of specialty coal have shifted into the second half of the year based on customer requests. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José Power Station for the remainder of the year until the fourth quarter, when we will have an extended planned outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and to have a small amount of incremental capacity, which will be available for sale in the spot market. Although the impact of the outage is minimized because it happens in the fourth quarter when hydro plant availability reduces the opportunity for spot sales anyway, it will impact results about $4 million compared to 2011. 
The challenging coal markets and issues at some other coal producers, have heightened interest among some investors regarding our outlook for TECO Coal beyond this year and have surfaced some misconceptions about the coal business. So before I close, I would like to address a few of these. 
First, TECO Coal is margin driven and not volume driven. Our future production in sales will be based on market conditions and per ton profitability. We'll mind what the market demands and is willing to pay an appropriate price for it. This means that we can't provide an outlook on future volume until we see what the market is. 
For 2013, we already have 2.5 million tons of thermal coal, contracted and priced in a range of $75 to $82 per ton. At this volume level, we're in pretty good shape for thermal coal sales for 2013.  For various reasons, including more surface sources, less washing, less depth, thermal coal cost less to mine than met coal, and are profitable at these prices. We haven't priced our met coal for 2013 yet, as the normal contract cycle for domestic met coal is late third quarter or early fourth quarter. And for the past several years, we have been selling most of our met coal domestically. 
For 2014, we have 1.2 million tons of thermal coal contracted and priced above $80 per ton. We would like to get more thermal coal contracted for 2014, but the good news is that we have 1.5 year to get it done and futures prices indicate an expectation of some market strengthening in 2013. 
To put some perspective on what we have invested in the coal business. At year end, our investment in mines equipment and reserves, net of depreciation was only about $200 million. And we don't have significant legacy liabilities. We're a nonunion operation, with benefits programs that are similar to the other TECO Energy companies. There's no debt specific to TECO Coal. And the reclamation liabilities for deep mines and preparation plants were about $20 million at year end. While the surface mine reclamation is done primarily as a current operating expense as we mine. 
In short, over the years, we've invested moderately in this business and have managed it conservatively. As a result, we've earned strong returns on our investment and limited our financial exposure. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communication activity. In September, we'll be meeting with investors on the East Coast in the mid-Atlantic at Boston areas. And the following week, we will be in New York at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investor Conference. And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

And where, traditionally,",416,"Kent, this is John Ramil. And let me address those. First of all, at the electric company, we are seeing our natural gas units, which are highly efficient combined cycle units, competing more with the coal companies for dispatch. And where, traditionally, the coal units would handle all of the baseloads and then the gas would kick in intermediate. The gas units are more competitive and they're running more. And I think, probably, utilities all over have seen that change in their mix a little bit. It's helped to keep customers' overall cost down because the fuel cost, confident of our rate, has stayed down. At the gas company, putting aside weather and the mild winter we had, we're seeing -- expected a strong use by our customers. But we're also seeing more and more customers wanting to switch from petroleum-based BTUs to natural gas BTUs because of, not only the current price differential, but expected future price differential. We are building a significant pipeline to an industrial customer up in the Northeast Florida area for just that purpose. They're going to be using natural gas in their operations rather than petroleum and other products moving ahead. We've seen the same type of interest from other businesses like nurseries or plants and things like that and other industrial processes. And of course, very, very significant interest from those that operate fleets of vehicles and converting their petroleum-based product vehicle fleets to compressed natural gas. And we've been in that process for about 1.5 year and we have things underway. And in about another year, we will have helped our customers put in enough compressed natural gas fleets to be the equivalent of serving about 27,000 new homes with natural gas. So we're seeing a lot of interest in that area. The negative effect we've seen from natural gas prices has been in the coal business as has been reported broadly in the industry that has reduced utility consumption of coal, which has left them with higher inventories. And so utilities are not buying as much coal and that's the biggest negative effect we see from the natural gas prices. But as Sandy said earlier, we're in the fortunate position of having timed our contracts for steam coal, such that we contracted in a pretty positive period and have nice contracts for this year, next year and 2014 at prices that we can make a good reasonable steam coal margin on. Sandy, you add anything to that?"

When we talked about -- we came out of our last rate case, we talked about our desire to stay out of rate cases and we needed some things to happen and one of them was to stay on our program to be efficient and we'll continue to do that. The other is we need to get the customer growth back up to the longer term expected 1%, 1.5% customer growth and that is starting to happen, but it's lax. It's been a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we're getting closer to that. And we also talked about, hopefully, we don't have weather hurting us.

And we think we can throttle up and down a fair amount and still remain profitable. As long as there's some reasonable pricing in the market. And we've shown that. One of the things, although we're not pleased with the numbers coming out of our coal company, on a relative basis, I think we're doing okay. And the thing I'm most pleased about is the success we're having in controlling our cost. We have spread fixed costs over fewer tons this year and that's been a challenge. But other than the early part of the year, January and February, as we transition from a little bit of a restructuring and a reduction in tons, our team there has been beating their targets on cost per ton. And they're focused on that and we're going to continue to do that moving ahead. And hopefully, stay on that bottom half of the range we provided."

Even though we hedged the diesel prices with the lack of surface permitting we're extending jobs and transporting product further. And over time, we've gone from about 1.5 gallon per ton of coal diesel to closer to $2 per ton of coal. So that had upward pressure. Natural gas prices have been down, which is helpful on explosives. But ammonia prices were up, which goes the other way. And diesel prices although directly we hedge it, at the rates I talked about earlier, it still affects other things like the lubricants and belting and those types of things. On the other side, I think there's a little bit -- it didn't happen immediately, but potential relief on labor cost as the markets have been softer. And as we shifted production and moved production less overtime, less contractors and that's been helpful in allowing us to control the cost of the levels that we have. So it's a mixed bag of upward and downward pressures, but our objective is to keep it down, obviously."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on another busy day for utility earnings reports. I understand that there are at least 10 companies releasing today, so I'll keep my remarks brief. I'll cover second quarter results, local and state economic indicators and our revised guidance for this year. 
In the second quarter, net income was $73.1 million or $0.34 a share, compared with $77.5 million or $0.36 in 2011. On a year-to-date basis, net income in 2012 was $123.6 million or $0.58 a share compared with $129.2 million or $0.60 last year. The most significant factor impacting the year-over-year comparisons, in both the quarter and 6 months, were the effect of milder weather on electric sales. 
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter, despite having had the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since it began to turn at the end of 2009, customer growth has been on a solid trend up. And for the second quarter this year, reached 1.3%. 
Retail net energy for load in the second quarter was 2.3% lower than last year. Total degree days were 6% below last year, primarily due to a wet and mild month of June, including the effects of Tropical Storm Debby the last week of the month. This negatively impacted sales to residential customers, although commercial and industrial sales were up. Tampa Electric also had higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth had reached 1.2% in the second quarter. Weather isn't a factor in the second quarter gas consumption. And we saw a firm sales increase in every retail segment, residential, commercial and industrial, as the Florida economy continues to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M expense in the quarter compared with last year. 
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal's results for the quarter reflected higher margin, but lower sales volume from last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $94 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was strong and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The second quarter price was below the $96 average price expected for the full year, as the sales mix this quarter was more heavily weighted to steam coal due to the timing of metallurgical coal shipments which will occur in the second half of the year. 
The all-in cost of production was $84 per ton, just below the middle of the cost guidance range, after experiencing higher first quarter cost associated with idling some facilities in that quarter. TECO Coal has been successful with its cost control action to offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
Second quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was higher than 2011, reflecting higher contract and spot sales volume and lower operating expenses. Other positive impacts, although smaller, include higher earnings from the TECO's gas pipeline that serves Jacksonville Electric and lower parent interest. 
We are revising our earnings per share guidance for the year to a range between $1.20 and $1.30, excluding any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. This revision is due to the effects of the mild year-to-date weather on Tampa Electric, and the expectation that the unsold tons included in our original projections at TECO Coal will not be sold this year. This range allows for some variation in weather and customer usage at the utility and for cost and the timing of contracted shipments at TECO Coal. 
The primary factor driving Tampa Electric's outlook is the year-to-date effect of the unfavorable weather on residential revenues. The rainy weather that hurt June continued into July as well. As a result of the lower residential revenues, we expect Tampa Electric will earn near the bottom of its allowed ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. 
Peoples Gas, because of the rate design implemented in its 2009 rate decision, is less weather and volume sensitive and should be able to earn at or above the middle of its allowed 9.75% to 11.75% ROE. 
Our outlook assumes that customer growth generally continues in line with the year-to-date trends at both utilities, and that weather for the remaining 5 months of the year is normal. The outlook also assumes that the current economic and housing market conditions in Florida generally continue and doesn't contemplate a major economic slowdown. 
So now turning to what we have been seeing in the local and state economies. If you're interested in seeing graphically some of the trends I'll be discussing, there are some graphs in the appendix that do that. The unemployment rate in the state continued to improve in the quarter until leveling off in June, unchanged from May at 8.6%. As a point of reference, it was 9% at the end of March and was 10.7% only a year ago. The civilian workforce continues to expand, up 0.4% over the past year. And the number of those employed statewide is up 2.7% compared with last year. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, unemployment also improved early in the quarter, declining from 8.5% in March to 8.4% in May. In June though, it ticked up to 8.8%, a seasonal pattern we've observed in prior years when the school systems close in May and school bus drivers and other school system employees are off for the summer. 
Over the last 12 months, Florida has added almost 71,000 new jobs in the field shown on the slide. During the same period, the Tampa area has added more than 23,000 new jobs, which is the strongest growth in any of the major metropolitan areas in the state. It's possible that employment in the Tampa area is benefiting from increased hiring ahead of the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Tampa the last week of August. And the final point on this slide, consumers are spending more in general, with taxable sales up 5% year-over-year in the 12 months ended in June. 
The housing market also continues to improve. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends expect new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than in 2011. And the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. You can see on the building permit graph in the appendix that new single-family building permits are trending up, with a very strong start to the summer. 
Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market. And there are even published reports out of South Florida of a resumption of condo tower construction. Growth in existing home resales continued, with resales in the 12 months ended June 2012, climbing 6% compared with the same period last year. The inventory of homes actively on the market, as is tracked by the Greater Tampa Association of REALTORS, was actually below 4 months at the end of June. At the end of March, it was 6 months, which already was considered a healthy market. 
The average home resale price bottomed in early 2011 and has been increasing pretty consistently since then. The average selling price in the 12 months that ended in June was 3% higher than the comparable period a year ago. Like other areas of the country, we've seen a higher level of foreclosures in the Tampa area this year, presumably as the banks have gotten past their documentation issue. 
Foreclosures spiked in February through May. But by June, had declined to previous levels. The percentage increase was high. But to put it into a practical perspective, the volume increase during that spike was the equivalent, in total, of about 1 month of housing resales activity. So as resale inventory at its current low level, it doesn't appear that the foreclosure spike we saw is likely to cause a major disruption. 
So overall, what we've seen recently in the state and local economies and housing markets has continued to be positive. 
For TECO Coal, we've revised our sales forecast, down to a range of 6 million to 6.3 million tons this year, based on the expectation that the roughly 10% of sales that were uncontracted at the end of the first quarter will not be sold this year. We are fully contracted at 6.3 million tons. So the range simply recognizes the potential variability of delivery schedule. The sales mix is now expected to be about 45% net PCI and stoker coals, since the unsold tons included PCI and some lower grades of met coal. 
For the year, the average selling price is expected to be slightly less than the $96 per ton, and the production cost is still expected to be in the range of $83 to $87 per ton for the year. We expect a somewhat higher average selling price of $97 for the second half, as some shipments of specialty coal have shifted into the second half of the year based on customer requests. 
At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal operations at the San José Power Station for the remainder of the year until the fourth quarter, when we will have an extended planned outage for a major steam turbine overhaul. When that outage is completed, we expect the turbine to have a better heat rate and to have a small amount of incremental capacity, which will be available for sale in the spot market. Although the impact of the outage is minimized because it happens in the fourth quarter when hydro plant availability reduces the opportunity for spot sales anyway, it will impact results about $4 million compared to 2011. 
The challenging coal markets and issues at some other coal producers, have heightened interest among some investors regarding our outlook for TECO Coal beyond this year and have surfaced some misconceptions about the coal business. So before I close, I would like to address a few of these. 
First, TECO Coal is margin driven and not volume driven. Our future production in sales will be based on market conditions and per ton profitability. We'll mind what the market demands and is willing to pay an appropriate price for it. This means that we can't provide an outlook on future volume until we see what the market is. 
For 2013, we already have 2.5 million tons of thermal coal, contracted and priced in a range of $75 to $82 per ton. At this volume level, we're in pretty good shape for thermal coal sales for 2013. For various reasons, including more surface sources, less washing, less depth, thermal coal cost less to mine than met coal, and are profitable at these prices. We haven't priced our met coal for 2013 yet, as the normal contract cycle for domestic met coal is late third quarter or early fourth quarter. And for the past several years, we have been selling most of our met coal domestically. 
For 2014, we have 1.2 million tons of thermal coal contracted and priced above $80 per ton. We would like to get more thermal coal contracted for 2014, but the good news is that we have 1.5 year to get it done and futures prices indicate an expectation of some market strengthening in 2013. 
To put some perspective on what we have invested in the coal business. At year end, our investment in mines equipment and reserves, net of depreciation was only about $200 million. And we don't have significant legacy liabilities. We're a nonunion operation, with benefits programs that are similar to the other TECO Energy companies. There's no debt specific to TECO Coal. And the reclamation liabilities for deep mines and preparation plants were about $20 million at year end. While the surface mine reclamation is done primarily as a current operating expense as we mine. 
In short, over the years, we've invested moderately in this business and have managed it conservatively. As a result, we've earned strong returns on our investment and limited our financial exposure. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communication activity. In September, we'll be meeting with investors on the East Coast in the mid-Atlantic at Boston areas. And the following week, we will be in New York at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investor Conference. And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

And where, tradition",417,"Kent [ph], this is John Ramil. And let me address those. First of all, at the electric company, we are seeing our natural gas units, which are highly efficient combined cycle units, competing more with the coal companies for dispatch. And where, traditionally, the coal units would handle all of the baseloads and then the gas would kick in intermediate. The gas units are more competitive and they're running more. And I think, probably, utilities all over have seen that change in their mix a little bit. It's helped to keep customers' overall cost down because the fuel cost, confident of our rate, has stayed down. At the gas company, putting aside weather and the mild winter we had, we're seeing -- expected a strong use by our customers. But we're also seeing more and more customers wanting to switch from petroleum-based BTUs to natural gas BTUs because of, not only the current price differential, but expected future price differential. We are building a significant pipeline to an industrial customer up in the Northeast Florida area for just that purpose. They're going to be using natural gas in their operations rather than petroleum and other products moving ahead. We've seen the same type of interest from other businesses like nurseries or plants and things like that and other industrial processes. And of course, very, very significant interest from those that operate fleets of vehicles and converting their petroleum-based product vehicle fleets to compressed natural gas. And we've been in that process for about 1.5 year and we have things underway. And in about another year, we will have helped our customers put in enough compressed natural gas fleets to be the equivalent of serving about 27,000 new homes with natural gas. So we're seeing a lot of interest in that area. The negative effect we've seen from natural gas prices has been in the coal business as has been reported broadly in the industry that has reduced utility consumption of coal, which has left them with higher inventories. And so utilities are not buying as much coal and that's the biggest negative effect we see from the natural gas prices. But as Sandy said earlier, we're in the fortunate position of having timed our contracts for steam coal, such that we contracted in a pretty positive period and have nice contracts for this year, next year and 2014 at prices that we can make a good reasonable steam coal margin on. Sandy, you add anything to that?"

And we told them welcome to our year, here at the electric company. And when we look at the balance of the year, we can have strong sales, hopefully, in August and September. But those are the months where you could really make it up. Beyond that, you can't make it up the whole. So the majority of it is weather driven. When we talked about -- we came out of our last rate case, we talked about our desire to stay out of rate cases and we needed some things to happen and one of them was to stay on our program to be efficient and we'll continue to do that. The other is we need to get the customer growth back up to the longer term expected 1%, 1.5% customer growth and that is starting to happen, but it's lax. It's been a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we're getting closer to that. And we also talked about, hopefully, we don't have weather hurting us. And unfortunately, last year and this year, weather has been hurting us."

One of the things, although we're not pleased with the numbers coming out of our coal company, on a relative basis, I think we're doing okay. And the thing I'm most pleased about is the success we're having in controlling our cost. We have spread fixed costs over fewer tons this year and that's been a challenge. But other than the early part of the year, January and February, as we transition from a little bit of a restructuring and a reduction in tons, our team there has been beating their targets on cost per ton.

Even though we hedged the diesel prices with the lack of surface permitting we're extending jobs and transporting product further. And over time, we've gone from about 1.5 gallon per ton of coal diesel to closer to $2 per ton of coal. So that had upward pressure. Natural gas prices have been down, which is helpful on explosives. But ammonia prices were up, which goes the other way. And diesel prices although directly we hedge it, at the rates I talked about earlier, it still affects other things like the lubricants and belting and those types of things. On the other side, I think there's a little bit -- it didn't happen immediately, but potential relief on labor cost as the markets have been softer. And as we shifted production and moved production less overtime, less contractors and that's been helpful in allowing us to control the cost of the levels that we have. So it's a mixed bag of upward and downward pressures, but our objective is to keep it down, obviously."

On a year-to-date basis, net income from continuing operations in 2012 was $200 million or $0.93 a share compared with $203 million or $0.95 last year. The more significant factors impacting the year-over-year comparison was the effect of the weather on electric sales, partially offset by better margins at TECO Coal. Here are the details on the discontinued Guatemalan operations. It includes strong results from the power operation, as well as the effects of the sales transaction for both the quarter and year-to-date period. The full impact of the sale, including the component that hasn't closed yet is captured as of September 30. And both the loss on sale and the charge associated with foreign tax credits that we won't be able to use in the future are slightly better than what we estimated when we announced the transaction.
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter, despite having the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since customer growth began to recover at the end of 2009, it has been on the followed trend up, and for the third quarter this year, reached 1.4%. Close to what we expect to be the new normal for customer growth.
Retail net energy for load in the third quarter was 1.6% lower than last year. Total degree days were 7% below last year, primarily due to a wet summer weather patterns. The summer of 2012 was the second wettest summer on record for the Tampa area, and included Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Izek the last week of August. We experienced several periods of persistent daily rain in the third quarter. And patterns like that can reduce daily energy sales to residential customers by 10% off normal level. Tampa Electric had lower interest expense am a higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities, and higher operations and maintenance expense. People reported higher results from last year and customer growth that reached 1.3% in the third quarter. Weather isn't a factor in third quarter gas consumption and we saw some sales increase in every retail segment: Residential, commercial and industrial as the Florida economy continue to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M in the quarter compared with 2011, in part from the recovery of legal fees related to previous environmental claim settlement. These graph showing Tampa Electric's cumulative customer addition is a good illustration of the slowdown we saw in 2008 and 2009 when customer growth stagnated, and how we've been adding customers at a very steady pace since then. TECO Coal achieved higher results this quarter from better margins on lower sales volumes than last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose $96 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was stronger, and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year.
The cost of production in the quarter was $84 per ton, which is below the middle of the cost of the guidance range, and that's after experiencing higher first quarter cost due to cost associated with idling some facilities. This is indicative of TECO Coal's aggressive action to manage cost and offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. We are reaffirming our 2012 earnings per share guidance range of $1.10 to $1.20, which reflects the reclassification of TECO Guatemala the discontinued operations, and excludes any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur.
The underlying factors in the guidance remained essentially unchanged from those discussed on our call in August and identified again on this slide. The graph from our next few slides illustrate the trends we're seeing in the local and state economies. Locally, we're seeing both workforce and employment growth. And the point I'm showing this is to illustrate that improvement in the unemployment rate is a result of the increasing employment, and not a shrinking of the workforce. In the past 12 months, the workforce has gone about 1% and the number of employed has increased 3%. In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric primary service area, the unemployment rate declined to 8.6%, and is now below the state's 8.7% rate. As a point of reference, the Hillsborough County rate was 10.6% as of this time last year. Over the last 12 months, Florida has added more than 63,000 new jobs in areas, including private education and health service, transportation and utilities and the hospitality sector. Even construction employment has picked up over the last several months. While still down from September of 2011, it is up more than 8,000 jobs from a low point experienced this spring. Of the 63,000 jobs added in Florida over the past 12 months, almost 19,000 over these were on the Tampa metropolitan area, making it one of the best job growth areas in the state.
As you can see from the nice upward trend in building permit, the single-family home construction market is showing some strengthening. Typically, it's about 6 months from the time that a building permit is issued until we see that as a new customer on the system. Metrostudy affirmed that tracks new home construction trends expect new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by end of 2012 than it was last year, and the actual year-to-date data to support those projections. Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market with a few of them up as much as 35%. Even the 1 overbuilt South Florida condo market is rebounding with little of the peak inventory remaining unfold, and I'll actually use some new condo towers being proposed. All of this level of new construction across the state has the potential suit eventually be reflected in Peoples Gas. The new single-family construction trends have been held later shrinking inventory of existing homes. Growth in existing home resales has continued to show us trial upward trend, in the inventor of homes actively on the market in the greater Tampa area was below 4 months in September. In the first quarter, it was 6 months, which is a level considered to be a healthy market, and remember, at the worst of downturn, it was 25 months. The final picture on the economy shows taxable sales in Hillsborough County with pseudo- campus located in the illustrate that the economy slowly improving, consumers are spending more as well.
Taking the seasonal spikes out, the trends have been steadily up for it seems sales bottomed in late 2009, early 2010.
We continued to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing in our state and local economies and housing markets, and our expectations going forward are for continued word.
All of our operating companies are currently in the annual cycle of developing the details of the respective 2310 business plan. And today, I'll discuss some of the high-level factors that we expect to influence 2013. A Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas, we expect customer growth to reflect the trends that we've experienced this year. Consistent with the longer-term forecast we have described to before, we anticipate that weather normalized retail electric sales growth will be about 0.5% below the expected customer growth. And the residential and commercial customer classes, that reflect the impact of new lighting efficiency standards and increased appliance efficiencies. For residential customers, that also reflects a smaller and more energy-efficient houses and more multifamily unit.
Sales to post-pay customers was strong in 2012, reflecting outages on some of their self generating unit. So we asked that reduced sale to this sector in 2013 as of the sales generation comes back. And Peoples Gas, we expect to continue to see the benefit of a more compressed natural gas vehicle conversion, and industrial customers converting from petroleum or propane to natural gas. At TECO Coal, although the current steam market is weak, we have 2.5 million tons of a steam coal already contracted for 2013 at prices ranging from $75 to $82 per ton, and these profitable levels for us.
The contracting period for 2013 met coal is underway, but proceeding slowly. The markets are very competitive and expectations are that met coal prices in 2013 will be well off 2012 levels. Until the met coal contracting is completed, it isn't possible for us to determine what our total volume or average overall selling price will be. In TECO Coal's mining plan, and therefore, its production cost we'll also be influenced by those outcomes. What we can tell you is that TECO Coal we'll mine to meet market condition, we'll only produce what they can sell a profitable level and we'll continue to focus on cost control.
Now, let me turn to the long-term growth prospects for Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas. At Tampa Electric, annual maintenance capital spending is about $350 million. That supports normal customer growth, system reliability, investments in information technology and small investments in smart grid applications. Tampa Electric completed its major investment in environmental controls in 2010, and so all of this space for coal units have a state-of-the-art environmental controls and are expected to meet all of the proposed EPA regulations with only minor additional investment. We are currently earning on all of those investments either through base rate for the environmental cost-recovery clause. Maintenance capital spending at this level is about $100 million above depreciation annually, and that represents about 2% annual rate base of growth. Peoples Gas increased this level of capital spending to about $100 million annually in 2012. In addition to customer growth in maintenance capital, this level of spending support system expansion to serve large commercial or industrial customers desiring to switch to natural gas based on the favorable gas economics. Capital spending at this level is about 8 [ph] people's annual depreciation and asset about 8% to rate base. People's will also replace about 150 miles of cast iron and bear steel pipe over the next 10 years. This approximately $10 million annual investment is recovered through a commission approved cost-recovery clause
In September, we announced that the lowest cost option for Tampa Electric customers was a conversion of 4 simple cycle CTs to combined cycle at the Polk Power Station, and that we would file with the commission for the determination of meaning for that project.
It is a $700 million project, including approximately $100 million of AFUDC and $150 million for transmission system improvement. The project has unexpected early 2017 service date to support modest customer growth, system reliability, and more significantly, to place expiring purchase power agreement. Tampa Electric's $345 megawatts our purchase agreement with a hearty powerstation expires at the end of this year, and will be replaced by several smaller contract through the end of 2016. The Pope conversion project we'll in part, replace that expiring contract that capacity. Tampa Electric's file for the need determination in September 12. The hearings on the matter is scheduled for December, would final decisions expected in January of 2013. This slide shows graphically that rate base growth that we expect through 2017, including the Pope project. The base level of maintenance capital spending, plus the investment in the Pope project represents about a 6% growth rate over that 5-year period in rate base. I'll close with our upcoming investor communication. We expect to file our 10-Q tomorrow. We will of course be at EEI in about 10 days, and hope to see many of you there, and we will be at the DMO conference in New York the first week of December. And now, I will turn it over to the operator we'll open the line for questions."

So a little bit of change, but not a whole lot. With respect to second part of your question, was customer switching on the natural gas side of the business? We're still seeing strong interest from customers in replacing natural gas BTUs, replacing their petroleum-based BTUs with natural gas BTUs. Even though there has been increased in price, the belief is the differential will still be there long-term, and additional benefit BC from using natural gas on the environmental side, and just the comfort side and the ease side are still driving for customers."

I expect your priorities have been elsewhere the last few days and hope you escaped any damage from Hurricane Sandy. As you probably know, across the electric utility industry, there is an all-out effort to get as many resources as possible to the affected areas for power restoration. 
Crews from Tampa Electric arrived to New Jersey on Tuesday, and all of us here wish you the very best as you recover from the storm's effects. Mark identified what we'll cover today, and I'll start my report with a look at the quarter. In the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $90.2 million or $0.42 a share compared with $86.1 million or $0.40 in 2011. Discontinued operations, which includes the effect of the TECO Guatemala sales transaction in 2012, showed a loss of $46.2 million. And I'll detail the elements of discontinued operations in a later slide.
On a year-to-date basis, net income from continuing operations in 2012 was $200 million or $0.93 per share compared with $203 million or $0.95 last year. The most significant factors impacting the year-over-year comparisons was the effect of weather on electric sales, partially offset by better margins at TECO Coal. 
Here are the details on the discontinued Guatemalan operations. It includes strong results from the power operations, as well as the effects of the sales transaction for both the quarter and year-to-date period. The full impact of the sale, including the component that hasn't closed yet, is captured as of September 30. And both the loss on sale and the charge associated with foreign tax credits that we won't be able to use in the future are slightly better than what we estimated when we announced the transaction.
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter despite having the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since customer growth began to recover at the end of 2009, it has been on a solid trend up and for the third quarter this year, reached 1.4%, close to what we expect to be the new normal for customer growth.
Retail net energy for load in the third quarter was 1.6% lower than last year. Total degree days were 7% below last year, primarily due to wet summer weather patterns. The summer of 2012 was the second wettest summer on record for the Tampa area and included Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac the last week of August. We experienced several periods of persistent daily rain in the third quarter, and patterns like that can reduce daily energy sales to residential customers by 10% off the normal level. Tampa Electric had lower interest expense, higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth that reached 1.3% in the third quarter. Weather isn't a factor in third quarter gas consumption, and we saw some sales increase in every retail segment: residential, commercial and industrial as the Florida economy continued to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M in the quarter compared with 2011, in part from the recovery of legal fees related to a previous environmental claim settlement. This graph showing Tampa Electric's cumulative customer addition is a good illustration of the slowdown we saw in 2008 and 2009 when customer growth stagnated and how we've been adding customers at a very steady pace since then. 
TECO Coal achieved higher results this quarter from better margins on lower sales volumes than last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $96 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was stronger and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The all-in cost of production in the quarter was $84 per ton, which is below the middle of our cost guidance range, and that's after experiencing higher first quarter costs due to costs associated with idling some facilities. This is indicative of TECO Coal's aggressive action to manage cost and offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
We are reaffirming our 2012 earnings per share guidance range of $1.10 to $1.20, which reflects the reclassification of TECO Guatemala to discontinued operations and excludes any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. The underlying factors in the guidance remained essentially unchanged from those discussed on our call in August and identified again on this slide. 
The graph from the next few slides illustrate the trends we're seeing in the local and state economies. Locally, we're seeing both workforce and employment growth. And the point in showing this is to illustrate that improvement in the unemployment rate is a result of the increasing employment and not a shrinking of the workforce. In the past 12 months, the workforce has brought about 1%, and the number of employed has increased 3%. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, the unemployment rate declined to 8.6% and is now below the state's 8.7% rate. As a point of reference, the Hillsborough County rate was 10.6% at this time last year. Over the last 12 months, Florida has added more than 63,000 new jobs in areas including private education and health service, transportation and utilities and the hospitality sector. 
Even construction employment has picked up over the last several months. While still down from September of 2011, it is up more than 8,000 jobs from the low point experienced this spring. Of the 63,000 jobs added in Florida over the past 12 months, almost 19,000 of these were on the Tampa metropolitan area, making it one of the best job growth areas in the state.
As you can see from the nice upward trends in building permit, the single-family home construction market is showing some strengthening. Typically, it's about 6 months from the time that a building permit is issued until we see that as a new customer on the system. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends, expects new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than it was last year, and the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market, with a few of them up as much as 35%. Even the once overbuilt south Florida condo market is rebounding, with little of the peak inventory remaining unfold and now actually some new condo towers being proposed. 
All of this level of new construction across the state has the potential to eventually be reflected in growth at Peoples Gas. The new single-family construction trends have been helped by the shrinking inventory of existing homes. Growth in existing home resales has continued to show a strong upward trend, and the inventory of homes actively on the market in the greater Tampa area was below 4 months in September. In the first quarter, it was 6 months, which is a level considered to be a healthy market, and remember, at the worst of the downturn, it was 25 months. 
The final picture on the economy shows taxable sales in Hillsborough County, where the city of Tampa is located, and it illustrates that with the economy slowly improving, consumers are spending more as well. Taking the seasonal spikes out, the trench have been steadily upward since sales bottomed in late 2009, early 2010. We continue to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing in our state and local economies and housing markets, and our expectations going forward are for continued growth.
All of our operating companies are currently in the annual cycle of developing the details of their respective 2013 business plans. And today, I'll discuss some of the high-level factors that we expect to influence 2013. At Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas, we expect customer growth to reflect the trends that we've experienced this year. 
Consistent with the longer-term forecast we have described to before, we anticipate that weather-normalized retail electric sales growth will be about 0.5% below the expected customer growth.  In the residential and commercial customer classes, that reflects the impact of new lighting efficiency standards and increased appliance efficiencies. For residential customers, it also reflects smaller and more energy-efficient houses and more multifamily units.  Sales to postpaid customers were strong in 2012, reflecting outages on some of their self-generating units. So we expect reduced sales to this sector in 2013 as their self-generation comes back. 
And at Peoples Gas, we expect to continue to see the benefit of more compressed natural gas vehicle conversions and industrial customers converting from petroleum or propane to natural gas. At TECO Coal, although the current steam market is weak, we have 2.5 million tons of steam coal already contracted for 2013 at prices ranging from $75 to $82 per ton, and these are profitable levels for us.
The contracting period for 2013 met coal is underway, but proceeding slowly. The markets are very competitive, and expectations are that met coal prices in 2013 will be well off 2012 levels. Until the met coal contracting has completed, it isn't possible for us to determine what our total volume or average overall selling price will be. 
And TECO Coal's mining plan and therefore, its production cost, will also be influenced by those outcomes. What we can tell you is that TECO Coal will mine to meet market conditions. We'll only produce what they can sell at profitable level, and we'll continue to focus on cost control.
Now let me turn to the long-term growth prospects for Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas. At Tampa Electric, annual maintenance capital spending is about $350 million. That supports normal customer growth, system reliability, investments in information technology and small investments in smart grid applications. 
Tampa Electric completed its major investment in environmental controls in 2010, and so all of its baseload coal units have state-of-the-art environmental controls and are expected to meet all of the proposed EPA regulations with only minor additional investment. We are currently earning on all of those investments, either through base rates or the environmental cost recovery clause. Maintenance capital spending at this level is about $100 million above depreciation annually, and that represents about 2% annual rate base growth. 
Peoples Gas increased its level of capital spending to about $100 million annually in 2012. In addition to customer growth and maintenance capital, this level of spending supports system expansions to serve large commercial or industrial customers desiring to switch to natural gas based on the favorable gas economics. Capital spending at this level is about twice Peoples annual depreciation and adds about 8% to rate base. Peoples will also replace about 150 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe over the next 10 years. This approximately $10 million annual investment is recovered through a commission-approved cost recovery clause.
In September, we announced that the lowest cost option for Tampa Electric customers was a conversion of 4 simple-cycle CTs to combined cycle at the Polk Power Station and that we would file with the commission for the determination of need for that project. It is a $700 million project, including approximately $100 million of AFUDC and $150 million for transmission system improvement. The project has an expected early 2017 service date to support modest customer growth, system reliability and most significantly, to place expiring purchase power agreements. 
Tampa Electric's 345-megawatt power purchase agreement with the Hardy Power Station expires at the end of this year and will be replaced by several smaller contracts through the end of 2016. The Polk conversion project will, in part, replace that expiring contracted capacity. Tampa Electric has filed for the need determination on September 12. The hearings on the matter are scheduled for December, with final decision expected in January of 2013. 
This slide shows graphically the rate base growth that we expect through 2017, including the Polk project. The base level of maintenance capital spending, plus the investment in the Polk project, represent about a 6% growth rate over that 5-year period in rate base. 
I'll close with our upcoming investor communication. We expect to file our 10-Q tomorrow. We will, of course, be at EEI in about 10 days, and hope to see many of you there, and we will be at the BMO conference in New York the first week of December. 
And now I will turn it over to the operator, who will open the line for your questions."

Natural gas generation competed with our coal generation a little bit more, but not to a huge extent. I think our natural gas generation is something like 4% or 5% higher than we might normally expect it to be, as prices have come up a little bit. Our coal units are dispatching a little bit more strongly versus them, as we'd expect. And remember our coal units are really southern-Illinois-type coal that are convenient with the natural gas prices. So we've seen a little bit of change, but not a whole lot. With respect to the second part of your question, was customer switching on the natural gas side of the business? We're still seeing strong interest from customers in replacing natural gas Btus, replacing their petroleum-based Btus with natural gas Btus. Even though there has been an increase in price, the belief is the differential will still be there long term, and the additional benefits they see from using natural gas on the environmental side and just the comfort side and the ease side are still drivers for customers."

I expect your priorities have been elsewhere the last few days and hope you escaped any damage from Hurricane Sandy. As you probably know, across the electric utility industry, there is an all-out effort to get as many resources as possible to the affected areas for power restoration. 
Crews from Tampa Electric arrived to New Jersey on Tuesday, and all of us here wish you the very best as you recover from the storm's effects. Mark identified what we'll cover today, and I'll start my report with a look at the quarter. In the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $90.2 million or $0.42 a share compared with $86.1 million or $0.40 in 2011. Discontinued operations, which includes the effect of the TECO Guatemala sales transaction in 2012, showed a loss of $46.2 million. And I'll detail the elements of discontinued operations in a later slide.
On a year-to-date basis, net income from continuing operations in 2012 was $200 million or $0.93 per share compared with $203 million or $0.95 last year. The most significant factors impacting the year-over-year comparisons was the effect of weather on electric sales, partially offset by better margins at TECO Coal. 
Here are the details on the discontinued Guatemalan operations. It includes strong results from the power operations, as well as the effects of the sales transaction for both the quarter and year-to-date period. The full impact of the sale, including the component that hasn't closed yet, is captured as of September 30. And both the loss on sale and the charge associated with foreign tax credits that we won't be able to use in the future are slightly better than what we estimated when we announced the transaction.
Tampa Electric reported lower net income in the 2012 quarter despite having the strongest customer growth we've seen since late 2007. Since customer growth began to recover at the end of 2009, it has been on a solid trend up and for the third quarter this year, reached 1.4%, close to what we expect to be the new normal for customer growth.
Retail net energy for load in the third quarter was 1.6% lower than last year. Total degree days were 7% below last year, primarily due to wet summer weather patterns. The summer of 2012 was the second wettest summer on record for the Tampa area and included Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac the last week of August. We experienced several periods of persistent daily rain in the third quarter, and patterns like that can reduce daily energy sales to residential customers by 10% off normal level. Tampa Electric had lower interest expense, higher depreciation expense due to normal additions to facilities and higher operations and maintenance expense. 
Peoples Gas reported higher results than last year and customer growth that reached 1.3% in the third quarter. Weather isn't a factor in third quarter gas consumption, and we saw some sales increase in every retail segment: residential, commercial and industrial as the Florida economy continued to improve. Peoples also benefited from lower O&M in the quarter compared with 2011, in part from the recovery of legal fees related to a previous environmental claim settlement. This graph showing Tampa Electric's cumulative customer addition is a good illustration of the slowdown we saw in 2008 and 2009 when customer growth stagnated and how we've been adding customers at a very steady pace since then. 
TECO Coal achieved higher results this quarter from better margins on lower sales volumes than last year. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $96 per ton due to met coal prices locked in when the market was stronger and higher average steam coal prices following the expiration of a below-market contract at the end of last year. The all-in cost of production in the quarter was $84 per ton, which is below the middle of our cost guidance range, and that's after experiencing higher first quarter costs due to costs associated with idling some facilities. This is indicative of TECO Coal's aggressive action to manage cost and offset the effects of spreading fixed costs over fewer tons. 
We are reaffirming our 2012 earnings per share guidance range of $1.10 to $1.20, which reflects the reclassification of TECO Guatemala to discontinued operations and excludes any non-GAAP charges or gains that might occur. The underlying factors in the guidance remained essentially unchanged from those discussed on our call in August and identified again on this slide. 
The graph from the next few slides illustrate the trends we're seeing in the local and state economies. Locally, we're seeing both workforce and employment growth. And the point in showing this is to illustrate that improvement in the unemployment rate is a result of the increasing employment and not a shrinking of the workforce. In the past 12 months, the workforce has brought about 1%, and the number employed has increased 3%. 
In Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service area, the unemployment rate declined to 8.6% and is now below the state's 8.7% rate. As a point of reference, the Hillsborough County rate was 10.6% at this time last year. Over the last 12 months, Florida has added more than 63,000 new jobs in areas including private education and health service, transportation and utilities and the hospitality sector. 
Even construction employment has picked up over the last several months. While still down from September of 2011, it is up more than 8,000 jobs from the low point experienced this spring. Of the 63,000 jobs added in Florida over the past 12 months, almost 19,000 of these were on the Tampa metropolitan area, making it one of the best job growth areas in the state.
As you can see from the nice upward trends in building permit, the single-family home construction market is showing some strengthening. Typically, it's about 6 months from the time that a building permit is issued until we see that as a new customer on the system. Metrostudy, a firm that tracks new home construction trends, expects new home starts in the Tampa area to be 5% to 15% higher by the end of 2012 than it was last year, and the actual year-to-date data supports those projections. Statewide, Metrostudy is reporting increased residential construction activity in virtually every major market, with a few of them up as much as 35%. Even the once overbuilt south Florida condo market is rebounding, with little of the peak inventory remaining unfold and now actually some new condo towers being proposed. 
All of this level of new construction across the state has the potential to eventually be reflected in growth at Peoples Gas. The new single-family construction trends have been helped by the shrinking inventory of existing homes. Growth in existing home resales has continued to show a strong upward trend, and the inventory of homes actively on the market in the greater Tampa area with below 4 months in September. In the first quarter, it was 6 months, which is a level considered to be a healthy market, and remember, at the worst of the downturn, it was 25 months. 
The final picture on the economy shows taxable sales in Hillsborough County, where the city of Tampa is located, and it illustrates that with the economy slowly improving, consumers are spending more as well. Taking the seasonal spikes out, the trends have been steadily upward since sales bottomed in late 2009, early 2010. We continue to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing in our state and local economies and housing markets, and our expectations going forward are for continued growth.
All of our operating companies are currently in the annual cycle of developing the details of their respective 2013 business plans. And today, I'll discuss some of the high-level factors that we expect to influence 2013. At Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas, we expect customer growth to reflect the trends that we've experienced this year. 
Consistent with the longer-term forecast we have described before, we anticipate that weather-normalized retail electric sales growth will be about 0.5% below the expected customer growth.  In the residential and commercial customer classes, that reflects the impact of new lighting efficiency standards and increased appliance efficiencies. For residential customers, it also reflects smaller and more energy-efficient houses and more multifamily units.  Sales to phosphate customers were strong in 2012, reflecting outages on some of their self-generating units. So we expect reduced sales to this sector in 2013 as their self-generation comes back. 
And at Peoples Gas, we expect to continue to see the benefit of more compressed natural gas vehicle conversions and industrial customers converting from petroleum or propane to natural gas. At TECO Coal, although the current steam market is weak, we have 2.5 million tons of steam coal already contracted for 2013 at prices ranging from $75 to $82 per ton, and these are profitable levels for us.
The contracting period for 2013 met coal is underway, but proceeding slowly. The markets are very competitive, and expectations are that met coal prices in 2013 will be well off 2012 levels. Until the met coal contracting has completed, it isn't possible for us to determine what our total volume or average overall selling price will be. 
And TECO Coal's mining plan and therefore, its production cost, will also be influenced by those outcomes. What we can tell you is that TECO Coal will mine to meet market conditions. We'll only produce what they can sell at profitable level, and we'll continue to focus on cost control.
Now let me turn to the long-term growth prospects for Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas. At Tampa Electric, annual maintenance capital spending is about $350 million. That supports normal customer growth, system reliability, investments in information technology and small investments in smart grid applications. 
Tampa Electric completed its major investment in environmental controls in 2010, and so all of its baseload coal units have state-of-the-art environmental controls and are expected to meet all of the proposed EPA regulations with only minor additional investment. We are currently earning on all of those investments, either through base rates or the environmental cost recovery clause. Maintenance capital spending at this level is about $100 million above depreciation annually, and that represents about 2% annual rate base growth. 
Peoples Gas increased its level of capital spending to about $100 million annually in 2012. In addition to customer growth and maintenance capital, this level of spending supports system expansions to serve large commercial or industrial customers desiring to switch to natural gas based on the favorable gas economics. Capital spending at this level is about twice Peoples annual depreciation and adds about 8% to rate base. Peoples will also replace about 150 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe over the next 10 years. This approximately $10 million annual investment is recovered through a commission-approved cost recovery clause.
In September, we announced that the lowest cost option for Tampa Electric customers was a conversion of 4 simple-cycle CTs to combined cycle at the Polk Power Station and that we would file with the commission for the determination of need for that project. It is a $700 million project, including approximately $100 million of AFUDC and $150 million for transmission system improvement. The project has an expected early 2017 service date to support modest customer growth, system reliability and most significantly, to replace expiring purchase power agreements. 
Tampa Electric's 345-megawatt power purchase agreement with the Hardy Power Station expires at the end of this year and will be replaced by several smaller contracts through the end of 2016. The Polk conversion project will, in part, replace that expiring contracted capacity. Tampa Electric filed for the need determination on September 12. The hearings on the matter are scheduled for December, with final decision expected in January of 2013. 
This slide shows graphically the rate base growth that we expect through 2017, including the Polk project. The base level of maintenance capital spending, plus the investment in the Polk project, represent about a 6% growth rate over that 5-year period in rate base. 
I'll close with our upcoming investor communication. We expect to file our 10-Q tomorrow. We will, of course, be at EEI in about 10 days, and hope to see many of you there, and we will be at the BMO conference in New York the first week of December.

Natural gas generation competed with our coal generation a little bit more, but not to a huge extent. I think our natural gas generation is something like 4% or 5% higher than we might normally expect it to be, as prices have come up a little bit. Our coal units are dispatching a little bit more strongly versus them, as we'd expect. And remember our coal units are really southern-Illinois-type coal that are convenient [ph] with the natural gas prices. So we've seen a little bit of change, but not a whole lot. With respect to the second part of your question, was customer switching on the natural gas side of the business? We're still seeing strong interest from customers in replacing natural gas Btus, replacing their petroleum-based Btus with natural gas Btus. Even though there has been an increase in price, the belief is the differential will still be there long term, and the additional benefits they see from using natural gas on the environmental side and just the comfort side and the ease side are still drivers for customers."

It's getting tougher and tougher to offset those, but we're committed to continue to do everything we can to keep cost down. On the coal company side, if you look, our cost per ton in the third quarter were actually on the lower side of our guidance range for the year and year-to-date are right in the middle of the guidance range. And that's in spite of the lower volumes, which we think would add about $3 to $4 a ton of fixed cost at the lower volumes we're at.
