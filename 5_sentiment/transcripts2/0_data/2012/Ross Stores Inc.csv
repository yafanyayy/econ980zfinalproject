Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Ch",838,"Good morning. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and 2011 performance, followed by our outlook for 2012. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
We are very pleased with our robust sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011, especially considering they were achieved on top of strong multiyear gains. Our healthy revenue growth continues to be driven mainly by our ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home to today's increasingly value-focused consumers. In addition, we continue to operate our business on lower in-store inventories, which benefited profit margins by driving faster trends and lower markdowns. It also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in our stores. 
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012, were $0.85, up from $0.69 for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011. These results represent a 23% increase on top of 18% and 53% gains in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter grew 19% to $192 million. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012, earnings per share were $2.86, up 24% on top of 31% and 52% gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2011 increased 18% to $657.2 million. 
Fourth quarter sales rose 12% to $2,398,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 4% and 10% gains in the fourth quarter of the prior 2 years. For the full year, total sales grew 9% to $8,608,000,000, with same-store sales up 5% on top of 5% and 6% increases in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Juniors and Shoes were the best performing merchandise categories for the quarter. For the full year, the strongest businesses were Dresses, Shoes and Juniors. Geographic trends were broad-based with all regions boasting solid same-store sales increases for both the quarter and the year. Florida was the top region for both periods. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the 2011 fourth quarter grew to 13% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of 60 and 260 basis point increases in the prior 2 years. For fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points on top of 140 and 250 basis point gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improved profit margins for both the quarter and the full year were driven primarily by a combination of higher merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes. 
As we ended the fourth quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 4% compared to the prior year mainly due to higher packaway levels that were about 49% of total inventories, up from 47% at this time last year. In-store inventories were down on an average about 7% in 2011 on top of double-digit declines in the prior 3 years. Our expansion plans remained on track as we added 49 net new Ross Stores during the quarter. 
As previously mentioned on our November earnings call, this growth included our initial entry into the Midwest region in October, with the opening of 12 new Ross Dress for Less stores in the greater Chicago area. As planned, we also accelerated new store growth at dd's DISCOUNTS in 2011, adding 21 locations and ending the year with 88 stores in 7 states. This business continued to deliver solid sales in 2011 and had significant gains in operating profit compared to 2010 when it realized its first year of positive earnings. Similar to Ross, dd's has benefited from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. 
Now let's talk about our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. In November, we announced the 2-for-1 stock split, and more recently, in January 2012, our board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 27% to $0.14 per share. This represented the 18th consecutive annual dividend increase since the program was initiated in 1994. Our recent stock split and ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our commitment to enhance stockholder returns. They also demonstrate confidence in our continued ability to achieve our growth targets while generating significant amounts of excess cash after self-funding the capital needs of our business. 
Now John will provide further color on our fourth quarter results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2012 guidance."

Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 13%. Cost of goods sold improved by 5 basis points, benefiting from a 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, including 15 basis points of lower shrink expense. Other positive drivers included 35 basis points in lower distribution costs and 30 basis points of leverage on occupancy these favorable trends were partially offset by 50 basis points in higher buying costs, mainly due to the timing of incentive expenses versus last year and 45 basis points of increased shrink expense primarily from higher rates and fuel costs versus last year. 
Leverage on the strong 7% comparable store sales gain in the quarter drove a 65 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Store operating expenses declined by about 40 basis points, while G&A costs were 25 basis points lower. As Michael mentioned, for fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points over the prior year. Total cost of goods sold improved by 35 basis points, mainly due to a 50 basis point gain in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shrink and 20 basis points of occupancy leverage. These favorable gains were partially offset by slight increases in freight, distribution and buying expenses of 2010 and 5 basis points, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative costs for the year improved by 50 basis points as the 5% increase in comparable store sales levered for store and G&A expenses. 
Turning to our stock buyback program, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total purchase price of $107 million. For the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total price of $450 million, representing half of our 2-year $900 million authorization. We expect to complete as planned the remaining $450 million in fiscal year 2012. 
We opened 70 net new stores in fiscal 2011, ending the year with 1,037 Ross Dress for Less stores in 29 states and, as Michael mentioned, 88 dd's DISCOUNTS in 7 states. 
Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2012 EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. 
Our fiscal year 2012 earnings per share forecast of $3.12 to $3.27 was based on projected sales growth of 7% to 8% for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012. This top line growth is forecast to be mainly driven by a 6% to 7% increase in the net number of stores and 1% to 2% growth in same-store sales. Our forecasted store growth for 2012 includes about 60 new or relocated Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. About 1/3 of these stores are targeted to open in new markets. These openings do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Our fiscal 2012 EBIT target is 12.5% to 12.7%, including an approximate 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week. This suggests that operating margin on a 52-week basis will be relatively flat to 2012 compared to 2011. A modest increase in merchandise gross margin, driven by a mid single-digit decline in selling store inventory throughout the year, is expected to be offset by some slight deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs from the forecasted 1% to 2% gain in same-store sales. We also expect somewhat lower selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales mainly due to a projected decline in incentive costs compared to last year. Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38% and we extract approximate 3% to 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding to about 223 million. 
Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. We also projected earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, up 11% to 16% from $0.74 in the fiscal quarter of 2011. Earlier this month, we reported a much better-than-expected same-store sales gain of 9% for February. That was aided by favorable weather throughout most of our markets, and with most of the quarter ahead of us, we reiterated our forecast for same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% in both March and April. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011. Despite exceedingly tough multiyear comparisons for both periods, we were able to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings. We continue to benefit from an increased focus on value by consumers, combined with a diligent execution of a number of strategies we have implemented throughout the company. Our top priority, of course, is continuing to strengthen our ability to acquire terrific name-brand bargains for our stores. To achieve this, we are making further investments in our merchandise organization. This is the key to both maximizing our access to the best opportunities for products and further expanding our very large vendor base. 
We also believe there is still room for additional reductions in selling store inventories. Today, these levels are almost 40% lower than just 4 years ago and we are targeting an additional mid-single-digit percentage decrease for 2012. Operating with less product in our stores had benefited merchandise margins due to fewer markdowns. Charting our merchandise faster has also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in front of our customers. Our planning and allocation systems and processes have been rolled out for 2 full years now. They are helping us do a better job of getting the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Planning and allocating at a much more detailed level is more important than ever today, especially with less inventory in our stores. Our performance has also benefited from our shortage control program which has resulted today in record low levels of shrink. In addition, we have implemented numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business to drive down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. All of this gives us the confidence to continue to target over the longer term average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same-store sales and reduction in shares from our ongoing stock repurchase programs. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and 2011 performance, followed by our outlook for 2012. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
We are very pleased with our robust sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011, especially considering they were achieved on top of strong multi-year gains. Our healthy revenue growth continues to be driven mainly by our ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home to today's increasingly value-focused consumers. In addition, we continue to operate our business on lower in-store inventories, which benefited profit margins by driving faster turns and lower markdowns. It also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in our stores. 
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012, were $0.85, up from $0.69 for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011. These results represent a 23% increase on top of 18% and 53% gains in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter grew 19% to $192 million. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012, earnings per share were $2.86, up 24% on top of 31% and 52% gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2011 increased 18% to $657.2 million. 
Fourth quarter sales rose 12% to $2,398,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 4% and 10% gains in the fourth quarter of the prior 2 years. For the full year, total sales grew 9% to $8,608,000,000, with same-store sales up 5% on top of 5% and 6% increases in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories for the quarter. For the full year, strongest businesses were Dresses, Shoes and Juniors. 
Geographic trends were broad-based with all regions posting solid same-store sales increases for both the quarter and the year. Florida was the top region for both periods. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the 2011 fourth quarter grew to 13% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of 60 and 260 basis point increases in the prior 2 years. For fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points on top of 140 and 250 basis point gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improved profit margins for both the quarter and the full year were driven primarily by a combination of higher merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes. 
As we ended the fourth quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 4% compared to the prior year mainly due to higher packaway levels that were about 49% of total inventories, up from 47% at this time last year. In-store inventories were down, on an average, about 7% in 2011 on top of double-digit declines in the prior 3 years. 
Our expansion plans remained on track as we added 49 net new Ross Stores during the quarter. As previously mentioned on our November earnings call, this growth included our initial entry into the Midwest region in October, with the opening of 12 new Ross Dress for Less stores in the greater Chicago area. As planned, we also accelerated new store growth at dd's DISCOUNTS in 2011, adding 21 locations and ending the year with 88 stores in 7 states. This business continued to deliver solid sales in 2011 and had a significant -- and have significant gains in operating profit compared to 2010 when it realized its first year of positive earnings. Similar to Ross, dd's has benefited from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. 
Now let's talk about our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. In November, we announced the 2-for-1 stock split, and more recently, in January 2012, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 27% to $0.14 per share. This represented the 18th consecutive annual dividend increase since the program was initiated in 1994. Our recent stock split and ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our commitment to enhance some stockholder returns. They also demonstrate confidence in our continued ability to achieve our growth targets while generating significant amounts of excess cash after self-funding the capital needs of our business. 
Now John will provide further color on our fourth quarter results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2012 guidance."

Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the fourth quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by ab",801,"Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the fourth quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 13%. 
Cost of goods sold improved by 5 basis points, benefiting from a 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, including 15 basis points of lower shrink expense. Other positive drivers included 35 basis points of lower distribution costs and 30 basis points of leverage on occupancy. These favorable trends were partially offset by 50 basis points in higher buying costs, mainly due to the timing of incentive expenses versus last year and 45 basis points of increased shrink expense primarily from higher rates and fuel costs versus last year. 
Leverage on the strong 7% comparable store sales gain in the quarter drove a 65 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Store operating expenses declined by about 40 basis points, while G&A costs were 25 basis points lower. As Michael mentioned, for fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points over the prior year. Total cost of goods sold improved by 35 basis points, mainly due to a 50 basis point gain in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shrink and 20 basis points of occupancy leverage. These favorable gains were partially offset by slight increases in freight, distribution and buying expenses of 2010 and 5 basis points, respectively.  Selling, general and administrative costs for the year improved by 50 basis points as the 5% increase in comparable store sales levered both store and G&A expenses. 
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total purchase price of $107 million. For the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total price of $450 million, representing half of our 2-year $900 million authorization. We expect to complete, as planned, the remaining $450 million in fiscal year 2012. We opened 70 net new stores in fiscal 2011, ending the year with 1,037 Ross Dress for Less stores in 29 states and, as Michael mentioned, 88 dd's DISCOUNTS in 7 states. 
Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2012 EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. 
Our fiscal year 2012 earnings per share forecast of $3.12 to $3.27 was based on projected sales growth of 7% to 8% for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012. This top line growth is forecast to be mainly driven by a 6% to 7% increase in the net number of stores and 1% to 2% growth in same-store sales. Our forecasted store growth for 2012 includes about 60 new or relocated Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. About 1/3 of these stores are targeted to open in new markets. These openings do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Our fiscal 2012 EBIT target is 12.5% to 12.7%, including an approximate 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week. This suggests that operating margin on a 52-week basis will be relatively flat to 2012 compared to 2011. A modest increase in merchandise gross margin, driven by a mid-single-digit decline in selling store inventories throughout the year, is expected to be offset by some slight deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs from the forecasted 1% to 2% gain in same-store sales. We also expect somewhat lower selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales mainly due to a projected decline in incentive costs compared to last year. Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38%, and we expect an approximate 3% to 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding to about 223 million. 
Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. We also projected earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, up 11% to 16% from $0.74 in the fiscal quarter of 2011. Earlier this month, we reported a much better-than-expected same-store sales gain of 9% for February. That was aided by favorable weather throughout most of our markets. And with most of the quarter ahead of us, we reiterated our forecast for same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% in both March and April. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011. Despite exceedingly tough multi-year comparisons for both periods, we were able to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings. We continue to benefit from an increased focus on value by consumers, combined with a diligent execution of a number of strategies we have implemented throughout the company. Our top priority, of course, is continuing to strengthen our ability to acquire terrific name-brand bargains for our stores. To achieve this, we are making further investments in our merchandise organization. This is the key to both maximizing our access to the best opportunities for products and further expanding our very large vendor base. 
We also believe there is still room for additional reductions in selling store inventories. Today, these levels are almost 40% lower than just 4 years ago, and we are targeting an additional mid-single-digit percentage decrease for 2012. Operating with less product in our stores had benefited merchandise margins due to fewer markdowns. Turning our merchandise faster has also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in front of our customers. 
Our planning and allocation systems and processes have been rolled out for 2 full years now. They are helping us do a better job of getting the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Planning and allocating in a much more detailed level is more important than ever today, especially with less inventory in our stores. 
Our performance has also benefited from our shortage control program, which has resulted today in record low levels of shrink. In addition, we have implemented numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business to drive down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. All of this gives us the confidence to continue to target over the longer term average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same-store sales and reductions in shares from our ongoing stock repurchase programs. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

And certainly, if I coupled out the dislocation of supply that could be going on now based on changes in strategies, that will help fuel our supply line during this period. And finally, I think our packaway position puts us in a much better position, in a very strong position to do well and if the economy starts to move a little up-tempo. So less commercial environment though in a better economy we think will be good for us.

Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and 2011 performance, followed by our outlook for 2012. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
We are very pleased with our robust sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011, especially considering they were achieved on top of strong multi-year gains. Our healthy revenue growth continues to be driven mainly by our ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home to today's increasingly value-focused consumers. In addition, we continued to operate our business on lower in-store inventories, which benefited profit margin by driving faster turns and lower markdowns. It also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in our stores. 
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012 were $0.85, up from $0.69 for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011. These results represent a 23% increase on top of 18% and 53% gains in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter grew 19% to $192 million. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012, earnings per share were $2.86, up 24% on top of 31% and 52% gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2011 increased 18% to $657.2 million. 
Fourth quarter sales rose 12% to $2,398,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 4% and 10% gains in the fourth quarter of the prior 2 years. For the full year, total sales grew 9% to $8,608,000,000, with same store sales up 5% on top of 5% and 6% increases in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories for the quarter. For the full year, strongest businesses were Dresses, Shoes and Juniors. 
Geographic trends were broad-based with all regions posting solid same-store sales increases for both the quarter and the year. Florida was the top region for both periods. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the 2011 fourth quarter grew to 13% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of 60 and 260 basis point increases in the prior 2 years. For fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points on top of 140 and 250 basis point gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improved profit margins for both the quarter and the full year were driven primarily by a combination of higher merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes. 
As we ended the fourth quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 4% compared to the prior year mainly due to higher packaway levels that were about 49% of total inventories, up from 47% at this time last year. In-store inventories were down, on an average, about 7% in 2011 on top of double-digit declines in the prior 3 years. 
Our expansion plans remained on track as we added 49 net new Ross Stores during the quarter. As previously mentioned on our November earnings call, this growth included our initial entry into the Midwest region in October, with the opening of 12 new Ross Dress for Less stores in the greater Chicago area. As planned, we also accelerated new store growth at dd's DISCOUNTS in 2011, adding 21 locations and ending the year with 88 stores in 7 states. This business continued to deliver solid sales in 2011 and had a significant -- and had significant gains in operating profit compared to 2010 when it realized its first year of positive earnings. Similar to Ross, dd's has benefited from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. 
Now let's talk about our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. In November, we announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and more recently, in January 2012, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 27% to $0.14 per share. This represented the 18th consecutive annual dividend increase since the program was initiated in 1994. Our recent stock split and ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our commitment to enhance stockholder returns. They also demonstrate confidence in our continued ability to achieve our growth targets while generating significant amounts of excess cash after self-funding the capital needs of our business. 
Now John will provide further color on our fourth quarter results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2012 guidance."

Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the fourth quarter was driven by mid single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 13%. 
Cost of goods sold improved by 5 basis points, benefiting from a 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, including 15 basis points of lower shrink expense. Other positive drivers included 35 basis points of lower distribution costs and 30 basis points of leverage on occupancy. These favorable trends were partially offset by 50 basis points in higher buying costs, mainly due to the timing of incentive expenses versus last year and 45 basis points of increased shrink expense primarily from higher rates and fuel costs versus last year. 
Leverage on the strong 7% comparable store sales gain in the quarter drove a 65 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Store operating expenses declined by about 40 basis points, while G&A costs were 25 basis points lower. As Michael mentioned, for fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points over the prior year. Total cost of goods sold improved by 35 basis points, mainly due to a 50 basis point gain in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shrink and 20 basis points of occupancy leverage. These favorable gains were partially offset by slight increases in freight, distribution and buying expenses of 2010 and 5 basis points, respectively.  Selling, general and administrative costs for the year improved by 50 basis points as the 5% increase in comparable store sales levered both store and G&A expenses. 
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total purchase price of $107 million. For the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total price of $450 million, representing 1/2 of our 2-year $900 million authorization. We expect to complete, as planned, the remaining $450 million in fiscal year 2012. We opened 70 net new stores in fiscal 2011, ending the year with 1,037 Ross Dress for Less stores in 29 states and, as Michael mentioned, 88 dd's DISCOUNTS in 7 states. 
Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2012 EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. 
Our fiscal year 2012 earnings per share forecast of $3.12 to $3.27 was based on projected sales growth of 7% to 8% for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012. This top line growth is forecast to be mainly driven by a 6% to 7% increase in the net number of stores and 1% to 2% growth in same store sales. Our forecasted store growth for 2012 includes about 60 new or relocated Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. About 1/3 of these stores are targeted to open in new markets. These openings do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Our fiscal 2012 EBIT target is 12.5% to 12.7%, including an approximate 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week. This suggests that operating margin on a 52-week basis will be relatively flat to 2012 compared to 2011. A modest increase in merchandise gross margin, driven by a mid single-digit decline in selling store inventories throughout the year, is expected to be offset by some slight deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs from the forecasted 1% to 2% gain in same store sales. We also expect somewhat lower selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales mainly due to a projected decline in incentive costs compared to last year. Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38%, and we expect an approximate 3% to 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding to about 223 million. 
Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same store sales to be up 1% to 2%. We also projected earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, up 11% to 16% from $0.74 in the fiscal quarter of 2011. Earlier this month, we reported a much better-than-expected same store sales gain of 9% for February. That was aided by favorable weather throughout most of our markets. And with most of the quarter ahead of us, we reiterated our forecast for same store sales to be up 1% to 2% in both March and April. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011. Despite exceedingly tough multi-year comparisons for both periods, we were able to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings. We continue to benefit from an increased focus on value by consumers, combined with the diligent execution of a number of strategies we have implemented throughout the company. Our top priority, of course, is continuing to strengthen our ability to acquire terrific name-brand bargains for our stores. To achieve this, we are making further investments in our merchandise organization. This is the key to both maximizing our access to the best opportunities for products and further expanding our very large vendor base. 
We also believe there is still room for additional reductions in selling store inventories. Today, these levels are almost 40% lower than just 4 years ago, and we are targeting an additional mid single-digit percentage decrease for 2012. Operating with less product in our stores has benefited merchandise margin due to fewer markdowns. Turning our merchandise faster has also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in front of our customers. 
Our planning and allocation systems and processes have been rolled out for 2 full years now. They are helping us do a better job of getting the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Planning and allocating at a much more detailed level is more important than ever today, especially with less inventory in our stores. 
Our performance has also benefited from our shortage control program, which has resulted today in record low levels of shrink. In addition, we have implemented numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business to drive down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. All of this gives us the confidence to continue to target, over the longer term, average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same store sales and reductions in shares from our ongoing stock repurchase programs. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

Off-price, specifically Ross, we do better when we're in a non-promotional environment or less promotional environment. So I think that would be healthy for our business. And certainly, if I coupled out the dislocation of supply that could be going on now based on changes in strategies, that will help fuel our supply line during this period. And finally, I think our packaway position puts us in a much better position, in a very strong position to do well and if the economy starts to move a little up-tempo. So less commercial environments though in a better economy we think will be good for us. And one other big difference from the last time that we've been in the good economic situation, a lot of retailers have gone away.

We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. We will conclude with some comments about our longer-term growth aspects. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with our much better than expected financial results in the first quarter. Our robust sales and earnings were driven mainly by our ongoing ability to deliver a wide array of fresh and exciting namebrand to the today's value focused consumers. In addition, we believe that favorable weather across many of our markets also contributed to our above-planned performance. Our ability to operate our business with lower in-store inventories and strictly controlled expenses also continued to enhance both sales and profit margins.
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012, were $0.93, up from a split-adjusted $0.74 in the prior year. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 28% gain in the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2012 first quarter were 21% from $208.6 million. Sales rose 14% to $2,357,000,000 , with comparable store sales up 9% on top of 3% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and geographic trends were per based, Juniors and Accessories were the best-performing categories while Florida remained the top region. 
Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.4% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of an exceptional 160-basis point increase in the prior year. Our improved profit margin versus last year was driven primarily by leverage on expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and higher merchandise gross margin. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories declined about 3% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower levels that were about 45% of total inventories, down from 48% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined about 9%. For the balance of the year, we are targeting a mid- single-digit percentage decrease in selling store inventories compared to 2011. 
Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh products to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. Dd's above-planned sales and margin in the first quarter reflect that its this merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its value-focused customers.
Our store expansion program is on track with a total of about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2012 comprised of 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
Now John will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter 2012 guidance."

Our 9% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%. Leverage on the robust 9% comparable store sales gain drove a 55-basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, while cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 15 basis points lower than the prior year. Merchandise margin grew by 35 basis points, including 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual while occupancy expenses levered by about 20 basis points. These favorable trends more than offset higher distribution costs of 20 basis points related to pathway timing and 10-basis point increases each in freight and buying cost. The 55 basis points of improved SG&A was driven mainly by lower store expenses as a percent of sales. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for a total purchase price of $111 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending July 28, 2012, we now are targeting in-store sales to increase 3% to 4% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year. Second quarter 2012 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75. This represents projected EPS growth of 13% to 17% on top of a 20% increase in the prior --  in the second quarter of 2011. Our second quarter 2012 EPS targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as I just mentioned same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. We plan to open about 20 net new stores during the period, including 21 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in May, 3% to 4% in June and 2% to 3% in July. 
Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 5% and 7% in May, June and July, respectively.
We are targeting operating margin of 11.9% to 12.1% for the 2012 second quarter, up 2o to 40 basis points from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. An increase in merchandise gross margin combined with leverage on selling, general and administrative costs is projected to drive the operating margin improvement. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be above 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $224 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27 and earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. The 53rd week in 2012 is projected to add about $0.08 to $0.09 to earnings per share. We are confident in our ability to meet these targets for a couple of reasons. First, we remain well positioned in the off price space in the current retail environment. Equally important is our strong belief that we can continue to diligently execute the most critical strategic initiatives of our business. These include ongoing investments in our merchandise organization, further reductions to inventories in our stores and our continuing efforts to fine-tune and implement systems and processes that strengthen our ability to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. 
In addition, we are pleased to report that our accelerated growth into new markets for Ross Dress for Less remains on plan. We initially ended Illinois last October with 12 stores in the greater Chicago area, followed by openings in Arkansas and Missouri. During the balance of 2012, we expect to add more locations in these 3 states while also entering Canada, Kentucky and Indiana for the first time.
We also are now even more bullish about our total expansion prospects over the longer term. As noted in today's press release, we've increased our long-term projected store potential to 2,500 locations in the United States. Our current in-depth research and proven ability to cluster stores closer together indicate that we can more fully saturate existing and new markets. As a result, we currently believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to approximately 2,000 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 1,500. We also continue to project that dd's DISCOUNTS can become a chain of about 500 stores. Combined, this means we have the ability over time to more than double the size of our company domestically, an exciting prospect. At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

And then we find to make an assessment about the real estate opportunities would be in each market. And then we built it up so bottom-up market by market to come up with estimate, which as Michael described going from 1,500 stores to 2,000. The other point I would make is that we also we've taken a look at the success that we've had over the last several years in some of our newer markets, Southeast and the Atlantic that, that give us confidence in terms of some of the we used to come up with these investments."

We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. We'll conclude with some comments about our longer-term growth prospects. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with our much better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter. Our robust sales and earnings were driven mainly by our ongoing ability to deliver a wide array of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers. In addition, we believe that favorable weather across many of our markets also contributed to our above-planned performance. Our ability to operate our business with lower in-store inventories and strictly controlled expenses also continued to enhance both sales and profit margins.
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012, were $0.93, up from a split-adjusted $0.74 in the prior year. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 28% gain in the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2012 first quarter were up 21% to $208.6 million. Sales rose 14% to $2,357,000,000 , with comparable store sales up 9% on top of 3% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and geographic trends were broad-based. Juniors and Accessories were the best-performing categories, while Florida remained the top region. 
Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.4% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of an exceptional 160-basis point increase in the prior year. Our improved profit margin versus last year was driven primarily by leverage on expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and higher merchandise gross margin. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories declined about 3% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower packaway levels that were about 45% of total inventories, down from 48% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined about 9%. For the balance of the year, we are targeting a mid- single-digit percentage decrease in selling store inventories compared to 2011. 
Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh products to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. dd's above-planned sales and margin in the first quarter reflect that its merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its value-focused customers. Our store expansion program is on track, with a total of about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2012, comprised of 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
Now John will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter 2012 guidance."

Our 9% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with the low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%. Leverage on the robust 9% comparable store sales gain drove a 55 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, while cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 15 basis points lower than the prior year. 
Merchandise margin grew by 35 basis points, including 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual, while occupancy expenses levered by about 20 basis points. These favorable trends more than offset higher distribution costs of 20 basis points related to packaway timing and 10-basis point increases each in freight and buying cost. The 55 basis points of improved SG&A was driven mainly by lower store expenses as a percent of sales. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for a total purchase price of $111 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending July 28, 2012, we now are targeting in-store sales to increase 3% to 4% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year. Second quarter 2012 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75. This represents projected EPS growth of 13% to 17% on top of a 20% increase in the prior --  in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our second quarter 2012 EPS targets are based on the following assumptions. Total sales are expected to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as I just mentioned, same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. We plan to open about 28 net new stores during the period, including 21 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in May, 3% to 4% in June and 2% to 3% in July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 5% and 7% in May, June and July, respectively. 
We are targeting operating margin of 11.9% to 12.1% for the 2012 second quarter, up 20 to 40 basis points from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. An increase in merchandise gross margin, combined with the leverage on selling, general and administrative cost, is projected to drive the operating margin improvement. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be above 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 224 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013, now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.2",380,"Thank you, John. As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013, now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27 and earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. The 53rd week in 2012 is projected to add about $0.08 to $0.09 to earnings per share. 
We are confident in our ability to meet these targets for a couple of reasons. First, we remain well positioned in the off-price space in the current retail environment. Equally important is our strong belief that we can continue to diligently execute the most critical strategic initiatives of our business. These include ongoing investments in our merchandise organization, further reductions to inventories in our stores and our continuing efforts to fine-tune and implement systems and processes that strengthen our ability to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. 
In addition, we are pleased to report that our accelerated growth into new markets for Ross Dress for Less remains on plan. We initially entered Illinois last October with 12 stores in the greater Chicago area, followed by openings in Arkansas and Missouri. During the balance of 2012, we expect to add more locations in these 3 states while also entering Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana for the first time.
We also are now even more bullish about our total expansion prospects over the longer term. As noted in today's press release, we have increased our long-term projected store potential to 2,500 locations in the United States. Our current in-depth research and proven ability to cluster stores closer together indicate that we can more fully saturate existing and new markets. As a result, we currently believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to approximately 2,000 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 1,500. We also continue to project that dd's DISCOUNTS can become a chain of about 500 stores. Combined, this means we have the ability, over time, to more than double the size of our company domestically, an exciting prospect. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. We'll conclude with some comments about our longer-term growth prospects. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with our much better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter. Our robust sales and earnings were driven mainly by our ongoing ability to deliver a wide array of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers. In addition, we believe that favorable weather across many of our markets also contributed to our above-planned performance. Our ability to operate our business with lower in-store inventories and strictly controlled expenses also continued to enhance both sales and profit margins.
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012 were $0.93, up from a split-adjusted $0.74 in the prior year. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 28% gain in the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2012 first quarter grew 21% to $208.6 million. Sales rose 14% to $2,357,000,000, with comparable store sales up 9% on top of 3% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and geographic trends were broad-based. Juniors and Accessories were the best-performing categories, while Florida remained the top region. 
Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.4% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of an exceptional 160-basis point increase in the prior year. Our improved profit margin versus last year was driven primarily by leverage on expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and higher merchandise gross margin. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories declined about 3% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower packaway levels that were about 45% of total inventories, down from 48% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventory declined about 9%. For the balance of the year, we are targeting a mid-single-digit percentage decrease in selling store inventories compared to 2011. 
Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. dd's above-planned sales and margin in the first quarter reflect that its merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its value-focused customers. Our store expansion program is on track, with a total of about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2012, comprised of 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
Now John will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter 2012 guidance."

Our 9% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with the low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%. Leverage on the robust 9% comparable store sales gain drove a 55 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, while cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 15 basis points lower than the prior year. 
Merchandise margin grew by 35 basis points, including 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual, while occupancy expenses levered by about 20 basis points. These favorable trends more than offset higher distribution costs of 20 basis points related to packaway timing and 10-basis point increases each in freight and buying cost. The 55 basis points of improved SG&A was driven mainly by lower store expenses as a percent of sales. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for a total purchase price of $111 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending July 28, 2012, we now are targeting in-store sales to increase 3% to 4% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year. Second quarter 2012 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75. This represents projected EPS growth of 13% to 17% on top of a 20% increase in the prior --  in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our second quarter 2012 EPS targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as I just mentioned, same-store sales  are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. We plan to open about 28 net new stores during the period, including 21 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in May, 3% to 4% in June and 2% to 3% in July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 5% and 7% in May, June and July, respectively. 
We are targeting operating margin of 11.9% to 12.1% for the 2012 second quarter, up 20 to 40 basis points from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. An increase in merchandise gross margin, combined with leverage on selling, general and administrative cost, is projected to drive the operating margin improvement. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 224 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27",380,"Thank you, John. As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27 and earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. The 53rd week in 2012 is projected to add about $0.08 to $0.09 to earnings per share. 
We are confident in our ability to meet these targets for a couple of reasons. First, we remain well positioned in the off-price space in the current retail environment. Equally important is our strong belief that we can continue to diligently execute the most critical strategic initiatives of our business. These include ongoing investments in our merchandise organization, further reductions to inventories in our stores and our continuing efforts to fine-tune and implement systems and processes that strengthen our ability to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. 
In addition, we are pleased to report that our accelerated growth into new markets for Ross Dress for Less remains on plan. We initially entered Illinois last October with 12 stores in the greater Chicago area, followed by openings in Arkansas and Missouri. During the balance of 2012, we expect to add more locations in these 3 states while also entering Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana for the first time.
We also are now even more bullish about our total expansion prospects over the longer term. As noted in today's press release, we have increased our long-term projected store potential to 2,500 locations in the United States. Our current in-depth research and proven ability to cluster stores closer together indicate that we can more fully saturate existing and new markets. As a result, we currently believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to approximately 2,000 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 1,500. We also continue to project that dd's DISCOUNTS can become a chain of about 500 stores. Combined, this means we have the ability, over time, to more than double the size of our company domestically, an exciting prospect. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. We'll conclude with some comments about our longer-term growth prospects. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with our much better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter. Our robust sales and earnings were driven mainly by our ongoing ability to deliver a wide array of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers. In addition, we believe that favorable weather across many of our markets also contributed to our above-planned performance. Our ability to operate our business with lower in-store inventories and strictly controlled expenses also continued to enhance both sales and profit margins.
Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012 were $0.93, up from a split-adjusted $0.74 in the prior year. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 28% gain in the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2012 first quarter grew 21% to $208.6 million. Sales rose 14% to $2,357,000,000, with comparable store sales up 9% on top of 3% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and geographic trends were broad-based. Juniors and Accessories were the best-performing categories, while Florida remained the top region. 
Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.4% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of an exceptional 160-basis point increase in the prior year. Our improved profit margin versus last year was driven primarily by leverage on expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and higher merchandise gross margin. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories declined about 3% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower packaway levels that were about 45% of total inventories, down from 48% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventory declined about 9%. For the balance of the year, we are targeting a mid-single-digit percentage decrease in selling store inventories compared to 2011. 
Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. dd's above-planned sales and margin in the first quarter reflect that its merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its value-focused customers. Our store expansion program is on track, with a total of about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2012, comprised of 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
Now John will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter 2012 guidance."

Our 9% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with the low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%. Leverage on the robust 9% comparable store sales gain drove a 55 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, while cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 15 basis points lower than the prior year. 
Merchandise margin grew by 35 basis points, including 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual, while occupancy expenses levered by about 20 basis points. These favorable trends more than offset higher distribution costs of 20 basis points related to packaway timing and 10-basis point increases each in freight and buying cost. The 55 basis points of improved SG&A was driven mainly by lower store expenses as a percent of sales. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for a total purchase price of $111 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending July 28, 2012, we now are targeting in-store sales to increase 3% to 4% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year. Second quarter 2012 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75. This represents projected EPS growth of 13% to 17% on top of a 20% increase in the prior --  in the second quarter of 2011. 
Our second quarter 2012 EPS targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as I just mentioned, same-store sales  are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. We plan to open about 28 net new stores during the period, including 21 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in May, 3% to 4% in June and 2% to 3% in July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 5% and 7% in May, June and July, respectively. 
We are targeting operating margin of 11.9% to 12.1% for the 2012 second quarter, up 20 to 40 basis points from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. An increase in merchandise gross margin, combined with leverage on selling, general and administrative cost, is projected to drive the operating margin improvement. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 224 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27",380,"Thank you, John. As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27 and earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. The 53rd week in 2012 is projected to add about $0.08 to $0.09 to earnings per share. 
We are confident in our ability to meet these targets for a couple of reasons. First, we remain well positioned in the off-price space in the current retail environment. Equally important is our strong belief that we can continue to diligently execute the most critical strategic initiatives of our business. These include ongoing investments in our merchandise organization, further reductions to inventories in our stores and our continuing efforts to fine-tune and implement systems and processes that strengthen our ability to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. 
In addition, we are pleased to report that our accelerated growth into new markets for Ross Dress for Less remains on plan. We initially entered Illinois last October with 12 stores in the greater Chicago area, followed by openings in Arkansas and Missouri. During the balance of 2012, we expect to add more locations in these 3 states while also entering Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana for the first time.
We also are now even more bullish about our total expansion prospects over the longer term. As noted in today's press release, we have increased our long-term projected store potential to 2,500 locations in the United States. Our current in-depth research and proven ability to cluster stores closer together indicate that we can more fully saturate existing and new markets. As a result, we currently believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to approximately 2,000 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 1,500. We also continue to project that dd's DISCOUNTS can become a chain of about 500 stores. Combined, this means we have the ability, over time, to more than double the size of our company domestically, an exciting prospect. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Before we review our financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent announcement of an updated CEO succession plan approved by our Board of Directors. As part of this plan and at my request, the board and I have reached an agreement where I will remain with the company at least through May of 2016. My CEO role will be unchanged until June of 2014. I will then become executive Chairman and the board will elect the new CEO from our strong bench of very talented and skilled senior executives. The new CEO will report directly to the board and take on responsibility from most areas of the company.
As the Executive Chairman, I will remain actively involved in the business with property development and dd's DISCOUNTS continuing to report to me. Our Chairman Norman Ferber will become Chairman Emeritus with his current consulting role to remain unchanged. The board and I firmly believe this type of long-term succession plan will allow us to remain focused on executing the strategies that have driven our outstanding financial results over the past several years. We are also confident this plan will help us continue to maximize future stockholder returns.
In a couple of years, I will partner with the new CEO to effect a smooth leadership transition. I was able to benefit from this type of mentoring relationship with Norman Ferber, who handed the CEO range to me 16 years ago. To ensure our ongoing success over the long term, I will continue to stay very engaged with the entire senior management team in setting strategy and direction for the company. I have been privileged to work with outstanding people at Ross Stores for 23 years and look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come.
Now turning to earnings. We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we will be happy to response to any questions you may have. 
We are pleased with our better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and first 6 months of 2012. Our strong sales and earnings growth for both periods continues to be driven by our ability to deliver compelling name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 28, 2012, increased 27% to $0.81 from $0.64. These results are on top of a 20% gain in the same period last year.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 23% to $182 million. Sales rose 12% to $2,341,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2011. For the 6 months ended July 28, 2012, earnings per share were $1.74, up from $1.38. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 23% gain in the first half of 2011. Net earnings for the period rose 22% to $390.6 million, up from $321.2 million last year. Sales for the first 6 months of 2012 increased 13% to $4,698,000,000, with comparable store sales up 8%, which was on top of a 4% gain in the prior-year period.
Merchandise and geographic trends were broad-based for the second quarter and the first 6 months. For both periods, Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing categories, while Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 second quarter grew to a record 12.8% of sales, up from 11.7% in the prior year. The drivers were higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories increased 2% versus the prior year, while packaway levels were 48% of total inventories compared to 49% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined 5%. As a reminder, we are planning selling store inventories to be down in the mid-single-digit range for the back half of the year.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's generated solid results in the second quarter with above planned sales and gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh products to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pretax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
With respect to Ross stores expansion program, we remain on track to open a total of 31 new Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter and about 80 stores for the full year. This growth includes our ongoing expansion into the Midwest, where we expect to operate 36 Ross stores by the end of the year. 
Now John will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our guidance for the balance of the year."
33926,157824260,347462,"Ross Stores Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Ross Stores, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 1",554,"Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 110 basis points in the quarter to 12.8%. The 80-basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by a 65-basis point increase in merchandise margin, which includes 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual and lower distribution and occupancy costs, which contributed about 50 and 25 basis points, respectively. These favorable trends more than offset 55 basis points of higher buying costs due in part to onetime severance-related expenses and modestly higher freight costs.
Leverage on the robust 7% comparable store sales gain drove a 30-basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to a lower store cost as a percent of sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total purchase price of $113 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the back half of the year. For the 13 weeks ending October 27, 2012, we are targeting total sales to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in August, 2% to 3% in September and 3% to 4% in October. This compares to last year when they rose 4% in August and 5% in both September and October. As Michael mentioned, we plan to open 31 net new stores during the period, including 25 Ross Dress for Less and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS.
Third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 compared to $0.63 in the prior year. Last year's third quarter benefited from much better-than-expected shortage results and a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements. Together, these items increased third quarter 2011 EPS by about $0.06 per share.
We are targeting operating margin of 10.4% to 10.6% for the 2012 third quarter. As I just mentioned, higher projected shortage this year compared to do very favorable prior year shrink results is expected to more than offset significant leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and improvement in merchandise gross margins in this year's third quarter. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 37%, up from 35% in the prior-year period. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $223 million.
For the fourth quarter, we are targeting same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending January 27, 2013, to increase 1% to 2% on top of strong 7% gain last year. For the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013, we are targeting earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.04, up from last year's $0.85. Without the estimated fair share benefit of about $0.89 from the 53rd week, fourth quarter EPS is projected to grow about 6% to 12%. Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

This compares to our prior guidance of $3.26 to $3.37 and represents projected earnings per share growth of 14% to 17% on a 52-week basis over earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. Looking ahead, we recognize that there are still a number of headwinds in today's macroeconomic and retail environment that could have a negative impact on consumer spending. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to plan our business conservatively. That said, we remain very liquid in our open-to-buy, and our merchants continue to find plenty of competitively priced name-brand fashions for the family and the home.

Those things included just how we factored out setting up an operating team, how we think about marketing. Obviously, we've talked a lot in the past about micro-merchandising and making sure we have better tools to come up with the right assortments as we enter new markets. So I think there are whole host of things that went into preparing for the new market entry. On the second part of your question, new customers versus existing customers. We know that from our own research, we do know that our comp growth has been driven by a combination of new customers and existing customers spending more or coming to the store more often. So it's really a combination of both of those."

Before we review our financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent announcement of an updated CEO succession plan approved by our Board of Directors. As part of this plan and at my request, the board and I have reached an agreement where I will remain with the company at least through May of 2016. My CEO role will be unchanged until June of 2014. I will then become Executive Chairman, and the board will elect the new CEO from our strong bench of very talented and skilled senior executives. The new CEO will report directly to the board and take on responsibility for most areas of the company.
As the Executive Chairman, I will remain actively involved in the business, with property development and dd's DISCOUNTS continuing to report to me. Our Chairman, Norman Ferber, will become Chairman Emeritus with his current consulting role to remain unchanged. The board and I firmly believe this type of long-term succession plan will allow us to remain focused on executing the strategies that have driven our outstanding financial results over the past several years. We are also confident this plan will help us continue to maximize future stockholder returns.
In a couple of years, I will partner with the new CEO to effect a smooth leadership transition. I was able to benefit from this type of mentoring relationship with Norman Ferber, who handed the CEO range to me 16 years ago. To ensure our ongoing success over the long term, I will continue to stay very engaged with the entire senior management team in setting strategy and direction for the company. I have been privileged to work with outstanding people at Ross Stores for 23 years and look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come.
Now turning to earnings. We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
We are pleased with our better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and first 6 months of 2012. Our strong sales and earnings growth for both periods continues to be driven by our ability to deliver compelling name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 28, 2012, increased 27% to $0.81 from $0.64. These results are on top of a 20% gain in the same period last year.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 23% to $182 million. Sales rose 12% to $2,341,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2011. For the 6 months ended July 28, 2012, earnings per share were $1.74, up from $1.38. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 23% gain in the first half of 2011. Net earnings for the period rose 22% to $390.6 million, up from $321.2 million last year. Sales for the first 6 months of 2012 increased 13% to $4,698,000,000, with comparable store sales up 8%, which was on top of a 4% gain in the prior year period.
Merchandise and geographic trends were broad based for the second quarter and the first 6 months. For both periods, Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing categories, while Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 second quarter grew to a record 12.8% of sales, up from 11.7% in the prior year. The drivers were higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories increased 2% versus the prior year, while packaway levels were 48% of total inventories compared to 49% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined 5%. As a reminder, we are planning selling store inventories to be down in the mid-single-digit range for the back half of the year.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's generated solid results in the second quarter with above planned sales and gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pre-tax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
With respect to Ross Stores' expansion program, we remain on track to open a total of 31 new Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter and about 80 stores for the full year. This growth includes our ongoing expansion into the Midwest, where we expect to operate 36 Ross stores by the end of the year. 
Now John will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our guidance for the balance of the year."
33926,157824260,347558,"Ross Stores Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,"Earnings Calls","Ross Stores, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 1",553,"Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 110 basis points in the quarter to 12.8%. The 80-basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by a 65-basis point increase in merchandise margin, which includes 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual and lower distribution and occupancy costs, which contributed about 50 and 25 basis points, respectively. These favorable trends more than offset 55 basis points of higher buying costs due in part to one-time severance-related expenses and modestly higher freight costs.
Leverage on the robust 7% comparable store sales gain drove a 30-basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to a lower store cost as a percent of sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total purchase price of $113 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the back half of the year. For the 13 weeks ending October 27, 2012, we are targeting total sales to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in August, 2% to 3% in September and 3% to 4% in October. This compares to last year when they rose 4% in August and 5% in both September and October. As Michael mentioned, we plan to open 31 net new stores during the period, including 25 Ross Dress for Less and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS.
Third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 compared to $0.63 in the prior year. Last year's third quarter benefited from much better-than-expected shortage results and a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements. Together, these items increased third quarter 2011 EPS by about $0.06 per share.
We are targeting operating margin of 10.4% to 10.6% for the 2012 third quarter. As I just mentioned, higher projected shortage this year compared to do very favorable prior year shrink results is expected to more than offset significant leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and improvement in merchandise gross margins in this year's third quarter. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 37%, up from 35% in the prior year period. We also estimate weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of about $223 million.
For the fourth quarter, we are targeting same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending January 26, 2013, to increase 1% to 2% on top of strong 7% gain last year. For the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013, we are targeting earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.04, up from last year's $0.85. Without the estimated per-share benefit of about $0.89 from the 53rd week, fourth quarter EPS is projected to grow about 6% to 12%. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

This compares to our prior guidance of $3.26 to $3.37 and represents projected earnings per share growth of 14% to 17% on a 52-week basis over earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. Looking ahead, we recognize that there are still a number of headwinds in today's macroeconomic and retail environment that could have a negative impact on consumer spending. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to plan our business conservatively. That said, we remain very liquid in our open-to-buy, and our merchants continue to find plenty of competitively priced, name-brand fashions for the family and the home.
In addition, we are very well positioned as a value retailer in the current climate. By efficiently executing our authorized business model, we believe we can continue to benefit from consumers' ongoing preference for bargains. To accomplish that, we plan to stay focused on the same strategy that have driven our successful growth over the past several years, namely offering our customers fresh and exciting assortments of compelling name-brand merchandise, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses.

John, if you could break those down for us between the transaction count versus average dollar sale and averaging at retail price. As I recall, it's primarily been an increase in traffic and an increase in transaction sort of driven your comp, so far, this year. And I'm wondering if you have any insight into the drivers of that surge in traffic. I -- as I think about your business over the last 10 or 12 years, I don't remember a year where I think traffic has been as robust as this year. So maybe just any insight you could offer there. And secondarily, if you have a similarly low shrink results this year, when you do your physical inventory in September as you did last year, would that be neutral to third quarter EPS?

As far as the transaction trends in the second quarter, the number of transactions as we mentioned was up mid-single-digit rates, so the driver of the comp was the transaction volume. We did see a little single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. But as of seen over the last several years, it's been traffic that has really driven the comp. And last year, we had a similar levels of kind of mid-single-digit increase in traffic, and that's been a recurring thing. As far as shrink is concerned -- so we have not doubt any benefit into positive shrink results above and beyond our approval this year. I'll remind you that over the past probably 2 or 3 years, the results have benefited the third quarter by probably $0.04 to $0.055 over a 3-year period. We don't think it's prudent to expect that again and continue to expect that because we're at historically low levels, and we think it's just prudent not to dial that in. And I don't think it's realistic that we'll receive the 4% to 5% benefit. Having said that, as Gary mentioned, we're still very bullish on our shrink work.

Before we review our financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent announcement of an updated CEO succession plan approved by our Board of Directors. As part of this plan and at my request, the board and I have reached an agreement where I will remain with the company at least through May of 2016. My CEO role will be unchanged until June of 2014. I will then become Executive Chairman, and the board will elect the new CEO from our strong bench of very talented and skilled senior executives. The new CEO will report directly to the board and take on responsibility for most areas of the company.
As the Executive Chairman, I will remain actively involved in the business, with property development and dd's DISCOUNTS continuing to report to me. Our Chairman, Norman Ferber, will become Chairman Emeritus with his current consulting role to remain unchanged. The board and I firmly believe this type of long-term succession plan will allow us to remain focused on executing the strategies that have driven our outstanding financial results over the past several years. We are also confident this plan will help us continue to maximize future stockholder returns.
In a couple of years, I will partner with the new CEO to effect a smooth leadership transition. I was able to benefit from this type of mentoring relationship with Norman Ferber, who handed the CEO reins to me 16 years ago. To ensure our ongoing success over the long term, I will continue to stay very engaged with the entire senior management team in setting strategy and direction for the company. I have been privileged to work with outstanding people at Ross Stores for 23 years and look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come.
Now turning to earnings. We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
We are pleased with our better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and first 6 months of 2012. Our strong sales and earnings growth for both periods continues to be driven by our ability to deliver compelling name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 28, 2012, increased 27% to $0.81 from $0.64. These results are on top of a 20% gain in the same period last year.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 23% to $182 million. Sales rose 12% to $2,341,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2011. For the 6 months ended July 28, 2012, earnings per share were $1.74, up from $1.38. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 23% gain in the first half of 2011. Net earnings for the period rose 22% to $390.6 million, up from $321.2 million last year. Sales for the first 6 months of 2012 increased 13% to $4,698,000,000, with comparable store sales up 8%, which was on top of a 4% gain in the prior year period.
Merchandise and geographic trends were broad based for the second quarter and the first 6 months. For both periods, Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing categories, while Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 second quarter grew to a record 12.8% of sales, up from 11.7% in the prior year. The drivers were higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories increased 2% versus the prior year, while packaway levels were 48% of total inventories compared to 49% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined 5%. As a reminder, we are planning selling store inventories to be down in the mid-single-digit range for the back half of the year.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's generated solid results in the second quarter with above planned sales and gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pre-tax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
With respect to Ross Stores' expansion program, we remain on track to open a total of 31 new Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter and about 80 stores for the full year. This growth includes our ongoing expansion into the Midwest, where we expect to operate 36 Ross stores by the end of the year. 
Now John will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our guidance for the balance of the year."

The 80-basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by a 65-basis point increase in merchandise margin, which includes 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual and lower distribution and occupancy costs, which contributed about 50 and 25 basis points, respectively. These favorable trends more than offset 55 basis points of higher buying costs due in part to one-time severance-related expenses and modestly higher freight costs.
Leverage on the robust 7% comparable store sales gain drove a 30-basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to a lower store cost as a percent of sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total purchase price of $113 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the back half of the year. For the 13 weeks ending October 27, 2012, we are targeting total sales to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in August, 2% to 3% in September and 3% to 4% in October. This compares to last year when they rose 4% in August and 5% in both September and October. As Michael mentioned, we plan to open 31 net new stores during the period, including 25 Ross Dress for Less and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS.
Third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 compared to $0.63 in the prior year. Last year's third quarter benefited from much better-than-expected shortage results and a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements. Together, these items increased third quarter 2011 EPS by about $0.06 per share.
We are targeting operating margin of 10.4% to 10.6% for the 2012 third quarter. As I just mentioned, higher projected shortage this year compared to do very favorable prior year shrink results is expected to more than offset significant leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and improvement in merchandise gross margins in this year's third quarter. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 37%, up from 35% in the prior year period. We also estimate weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of about $223 million.
For the fourth quarter, we are targeting same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending January 26, 2013, to increase 1% to 2% on top of strong 7% gain last year. For the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013, we are targeting earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.04, up from last year's $0.85. Without the estimated per-share benefit of about $0.89 from the 53rd week, fourth quarter EPS is projected to grow about 6% to 12%. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

This compares to our prior guidance of $3.26 to $3.37 and represents projected earnings per share growth of 14% to 17% on a 52-week basis over earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. Looking ahead, we recognize that there are still a number of headwinds in today's macroeconomic and retail environment that could have a negative impact on consumer spending. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to plan our business conservatively. That said, we remain very liquid in our open-to-buy, and our merchants continue to find plenty of competitively priced, name-brand fashions for the family and the home.
In addition, we are very well positioned as a value retailer in the current climate. By efficiently executing our authorized business model, we believe we can continue to benefit from consumers' ongoing preference for bargains. To accomplish that, we plan to stay focused on the same strategy that have driven our successful growth over the past several years, namely offering our customers fresh and exciting assortments of compelling name-brand merchandise, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses. 
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

We will begin with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the upcoming holiday season. After which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with the strong sales and earnings gains we generated in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. Our better-than-expected results year-to-date were driven by our ongoing ability to offer shoppers a fresh and exciting array of compelling name-brand bargains for the family and the home. In addition, operating off stores on lower inventories while strictly controlling expenses continues to enhance profit margins. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 27, 2012, increased 14% to $0.72, up from $0.63. These results are on top of a 24% gain in last year's third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter grew 11% to $159.5 million. Sales rose 11% to $2,263,000,000, with comparable store sales up 6% following 5% growth in the third quarter of 2011.
For the 9 months ended October 27, 2012, earnings per share were $2.46, up from $2.01. These results represent a 22% increase versus a 24% gain last year. Net earnings for the period rose 18% to $550.2 million, up from $465.2 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Sales for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 12% to $6,960,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of a 5% gain for the same period last year.
Merchandising geographic trends were broad-based for the third quarter. Juniors was the best-performing category while the Southwest Texas and Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 third quarter grew to a record 11.3% of sales, up from 10.9% last year. As a percent of sales, higher merchandise margin, lower distribution costs and leverage on occupancy and general, selling and administrative expenses, were partially offset by a lower shortage benefit and the prior-year and increases in freight and buying costs. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over last year, while packaway levels were 46% of total inventories compared to 43% at this time in 2011. More importantly, average in-store inventories were down 6% at the end of the quarter, and we continue to target selling store inventories to define in the mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. Dd's continued to generate solid results in the third quarter with better than expected sales and profitability. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pretax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
We also recently completed our store expansion program for the year, adding 31 new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS locations combined in the third quarter for a total of 80 new stores in 2012 as planned. 
Now John will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter."

Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35",544,"Thank you, Michael. Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35 basis points in the quarter to 11.3% as 40 basis points of leverage on selling, general and administrative costs was partially offset by a 5-basis point increase in the cost of goods sold compared to the prior year. The slight increase in cost of goods sold consisted of 30 basis points of higher merchandise margin, 15 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs and distribution expenses that declined approximately 45 basis points, the latter was mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related processing costs.
These improvements were offset by 45 basis points from a lower shortage benefit than the prior year and buying and freight expenses that increased 25 basis points each. Shortage results from this year's annual physical inventory were better than expected, adding about $0.02 in earnings per share. However, the favorable variance versus our reserves was larger in the third quarter of 2011 when we realized a $0.04 benefit.
In addition, last year's third quarter was aided by a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements that added approximately $0.02 to earnings per share. 
Our repurchase program also remains on track as we bought back 1.7 million shares in the quarter for a total purchase price of $111 million. As a result, year-to-date, we have repurchased $5.4 million shares for a total price of $334 million. We expect to buy $116 million in common stock during the fourth quarter, which will complete the 2-year $900 million program announced in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in today's press release, we continue to forecast earnings per share of $0.99 to $1.04 for the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013. This compares to $0.85 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012. The benefit to EPS from the 53rd week in 2012 is estimated to be about $0.08 to $0.09 and is included in this guidance range. 
Operating statement assumptions for the quarter include the following: We are targeting total sales to grow about 12% to 13%, driven by a combination of new store growth, same-store sales that are forecast to be up 1% to 2% and the benefit from this year's 53rd week. As a reminder, we have a challenging comparison as same-store sales were up a robust 7% in last year's fourth quarter. Comparable store sales are planned to be flat to up 1% in November, up 2% to 3% in December and up 1% to 2% in January. December is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter, as it has 2 extra shopping days before Christmas compared to 2011. Same-store sales increased 5%, 9% and 5%, respectively, in November, December and January of last year. 
We are targeting fourth quarter operating margin of 13.2% to 13.5%. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $221 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As previously noted, we are pleased with our strong performance for the first 9 months of 2012. Our financial results reflect that we continue to benefit from our ability to efficiently execute our off price strategies, making our stores attractive destinations for today's value-conscious customers. As we enter the important fourth quarter, our merchants are doing a terrific job of delivering plenty of bargain-priced gifts and fashions for the family and the home. That said, during the holiday season, it is always difficult to predict how commercial and other retailers may become or how current macroeconomic and political uncertainties may impact consumer spending. In addition, as John noted, same-store sales increased a robust 7% in the fourth quarter of 2011 for our most challenging comparison of the year. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain our prior fourth quarter forecast for both sales and earnings. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, are now forecast to be $3.45 to $3.50, which includes the estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.08 to $0.09 from the extra week. 
On a 52-week basis, our guidance range for fiscal 2012 represent solid projected earnings per share growth up 17% to 19% on top of a 24% increase in fiscal 2011 when we reported earnings per share of $2.86.
Looking ahead, our top priority continues to be maximizing our ability to offer shoppers the best bargains possible. Investing in our merchant organization has been and still is our most important initiative. And today, we have hundreds of merchants sourcing products from thousands of vendors. Our commitment to increasing these key resources should ensure that we will have ongoing access to an abundance of exciting namebrand products to drive our future growth. 
In closing, we continue to target average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% over the longer term. We believe we can achieve these through a combination of store growth, same-store sales gains, sustainable operating margins and the benefit to earnings per share from our ongoing stock repurchase program.

We will begin with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the upcoming holiday season. After which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with the strong sales and earnings gains we generated in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. Our better-than-expected results year-to-date were driven by our ongoing ability to offer shoppers a fresh and exciting array of compelling name-brand bargains for the family and the home. In addition, operating of stores on lower inventories while strictly controlling expenses continues to enhance profit margins. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 27, 2012, increased 14% to $0.72, up from $0.63. These results are on top of a 24% gain in last year's third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter grew 11% to $159.5 million. Sales rose 11% to $2,263,000,000, with comparable store sales up 6% following 5% growth in the third quarter of 2011.
For the 9 months ended October 27, 2012, earnings per share were $2.46, up from $2.01. These results represent a 22% increase versus a 24% gain last year. Net earnings for the period rose 18% to $550.2 million, up from $465.2 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Sales for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 12% to $6,960,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of a 5% gain for the same period last year.
Merchandising geographic trends were broad-based for the third quarter. Juniors was the best-performing category while the Southwest Texas and Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 third quarter grew to a record 11.3% of sales, up from 10.9% last year. As a percent of sales, higher merchandise margin, lower distribution cost and leverage on occupancy and general, selling and administrative expenses, were partially offset by a lower shortage benefit in the prior-year and increases in freight and buying cost. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over last year, while packaway levels were 46% of total inventories compared to 43% at this time in 2011. More importantly, average in-store inventories were down 6% at the end of the quarter, and we continue to target selling store inventories to decline in the mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. Dd's continued to generate solid results in the third quarter with better than expected sales and profitability. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pretax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
We also recently completed our store expansion program for the year, adding 31 new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS locations combined in the third quarter for a total of 80 new stores in 2012 as planned. 
Now John will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter."

Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35",544,"Thank you, Michael. Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35 basis points in the quarter to 11.3% as 40 basis points of leverage on selling, general and administrative cost was partially offset by a 5-basis point increase in the cost of goods sold compared to the prior year. The slight increase in cost of goods sold consisted of 30 basis points of higher merchandise margin, 15 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs and distribution expenses that declined approximately 45 basis points, the latter was mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related processing costs.
These improvements were offset by 45 basis points from a lower shortage benefit than the prior year and buying and freight expenses that increased 25 basis points each. Shortage results from this year's annual physical inventory were better than expected, adding about $0.02 in earnings per share. However, the favorable variance versus our reserves was larger in the third quarter of 2011 when we realized a $0.04 benefit.
In addition, last year's third quarter was aided by a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements that added approximately $0.02 to earnings per share. 
Our repurchase program also remains on track as we bought back 1.7 million shares in the quarter for a total purchase price of $111 million. As a result, year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total price of $334 million. We expect to buy $116 million in common stock during the fourth quarter, which will complete the 2-year $900 million program announced in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in today's press release, we continue to forecast earnings per share of $0.99 to $1.04 for the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013. This compares to $0.85 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012. The benefit to EPS from the 53rd week in 2012 is estimated to be about $0.08 to $0.09 and is included in this guidance range. 
Operating statement assumptions for the quarter include the following: we are targeting total sales to grow about 12% to 13%, driven by a combination of new store growth; same-store sales that are forecast to be up 1% to 2% and the benefit from this year's 53rd week. As a reminder, we have a challenging comparison as same-store sales were up a robust 7% in last year's fourth quarter. Comparable store sales are planned to be flat to up 1% in November, up 2% to 3% in December and up 1% to 2% in January. December is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter, as it has 2 extra shopping days before Christmas compared to 2011. Same-store sales increased 5%, 9% and 5%, respectively, in November, December and January of last year. 
We are targeting fourth quarter operating margin of 13.2% to 13.5%. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 221 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As previously noted, we are pleased with our strong performance for the first 9 months of 2012. Our financial results reflect that we continue to benefit from our ability to efficiently execute our off price strategies, making our stores attractive destinations for today's value-conscious customers. As we enter the important fourth quarter, our merchants are doing a terrific job of delivering plenty of bargain-priced gifts and fashions for the family and the home. That said, during the holiday season, it is always difficult to predict how commercial and other retailers may become or how current macroeconomic and political uncertainties may impact consumer spending. In addition, as John noted, same-store sales increased a robust 7% in the fourth quarter of 2011 for our most challenging comparison of the year. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain our prior fourth quarter forecast for both sales and earnings. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, are now forecast to be $3.45 to $3.50, which includes the estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.08 to $0.09 from the extra week. 
On a 52-week basis, our guidance range for fiscal 2012 represents solid projected earnings per share growth up 17% to 19% on top of a 24% increase in fiscal 2011 when we reported earnings per share of $2.86.
Looking ahead, our top priority continues to be maximizing our ability to offer shoppers the best bargains possible. Investing in our merchant organization has been and still is our most important initiative. And today, we have hundreds of merchants sourcing products from thousands of vendors. Our commitment to increasing these key resources should ensure that we will have ongoing access to an abundance of exciting namebrand products to drive our future growth. 
In closing, we continue to target average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% over the longer term. We believe we can achieve this through a combination of store growth, same-store sales gains, sustainable operating margins and the benefit to earnings per share from our ongoing stock repurchase program. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

We will begin with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the upcoming holiday season, after which we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
We are pleased with the strong sales and earnings gains we generated in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. Our better-than-expected results year-to-date were driven by our ongoing ability to offer shoppers a fresh and exciting array of compelling name-brand bargains for the family and the home. In addition, operating of stores on lower inventories while strictly controlling expenses continues to enhance profit margins. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 27, 2012, increased 14% to $0.72, up from $0.63. These results are on top of a 24% gain in last year's third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter grew 11% to $159.5 million. Sales rose 11% to $2,263,000,000 with comparable store sales up 6% following 5% growth in the third quarter of 2011.
For the 9 months ended October 27, 2012, earnings per share were $2.46, up from $2.01. These results represent a 22% increase versus a 24% gain last year. Net earnings for the period rose 18% to $550.2 million, up from $465.2 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Sales for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 12% to $6,960,000,000 with comparable store sales up 7% on top of a 5% gain for the same period last year.
Merchandising geographic trends were broad-based for the third quarter. Juniors was the best-performing category, while the Southwest Texas and Florida showed the most geographic strength. 
Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 third quarter grew to a record 11.3% of sales, up from 10.9% last year. As a percent of sales, higher merchandise margin, lower distribution cost and leverage on occupancy and general, selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by a lower shortage benefit in the prior year and increases in freight and buying costs. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over last year, while packaway levels were 46% of total inventories compared to 43% at this time in 2011. More importantly, average in-store inventories were down 6% at the end of the quarter, and we continue to target selling store inventories to decline in the mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's continued to generate solid results in the third quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pretax earnings for 2012 compared to last year. 
We also recently completed our store expansion program for the year, adding 31 new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS locations combined in the third quarter for a total of 80 new stores in 2012 as planned. 
Now John will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter."

Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35",542,"Thank you, Michael. Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35 basis points in the quarter to 11.3% as 40 basis points of leverage on selling, general and administrative cost was partially offset by a 5-basis-point increase in the cost of goods sold compared to the prior year. The slight increase in cost of goods sold consisted of 30 basis points of higher merchandise margin, 15 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs and distribution expenses that declined approximately 45 basis points.  The latter was mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related processing costs.
These improvements were offset by 45 basis points from a lower shortage benefit than the prior year and buying and freight expenses that increased 25 basis points each. Shortage results from this year's annual physical inventory were better than expected, adding about $0.02 in earnings per share. However, the favorable variance versus our reserves was larger in the third quarter of 2011, when we realized a $0.04 benefit.
In addition, last year's third quarter was aided by a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements that added approximately $0.02 to earnings per share. 
Our repurchase program also remains on track as we bought back 1.7 million shares in the quarter for a total purchase price of $111 million. As a result, year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total price of $334 million. We expect to buy $116 million in common stock during the fourth quarter, which will complete the 2-year $900 million program announced in early 2011.
Let's turn now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in today's press release, we continue to forecast earnings per share of $0.99 to $1.04 for the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013. This compares to $0.85 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012. The benefit to EPS from the 53rd week in 2012 is estimated to be about $0.08 to $0.09 and is included in this guidance range. 
Operating statement assumptions for the quarter include the following: we are targeting total sales to grow about 12% to 13%, driven by a combination of new store growth; same-store sales that are forecast to be up 1% to 2% and the benefit from this year's 53rd week. As a reminder, we have a challenging comparison as same-store sales were up a robust 7% in last year's fourth quarter. Comparable store sales are planned to be flat to up 1% in November, up 2% to 3% in December and up 1% to 2% in January. December is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter as it has 2 extra shopping days before Christmas compared to 2011. Same-store sales increased 5%, 9% and 5%, respectively, in November, December and January of last year. 
We are targeting fourth quarter operating margin of 13.2% to 13.5%. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 221 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Michael."

As previously noted, we are pleased with our strong performance for the first 9 months of 2012. Our financial results reflect that we continue to benefit from our ability to efficiently execute our off-price strategies, making our stores attractive destinations for today's value-conscious customers. As we enter the important fourth quarter, our merchants are doing a terrific job of delivering plenty of bargain-priced gifts and fashions for the family and the home. That said, during the holiday season, it is always difficult to predict how commercial and other retailers may become or how current macroeconomic and political uncertainties may impact consumer spending. In addition, as John noted, same-store sales increased a robust 7% in the fourth quarter of 2011 for our most challenging comparison of the year. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain our prior fourth quarter forecast for both sales and earnings. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, are now forecast to be $3.45 to $3.50, which includes the estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.08 to $0.09 from the extra week. 
On a 52-week basis, our guidance range for fiscal 2012 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 17% to 19% on top of a 24% increase in fiscal 2011, when we reported earnings per share of $2.86.
Looking ahead, our top priority continues to be maximizing our ability to offer shoppers the best bargains possible. Investing in our merchant organization has been and still is our most important initiative. And today, we have hundreds of merchants sourcing products from thousands of vendors. Our commitment to increasing these key resources should ensure that we will have ongoing access to an abundance of exciting name-brand products to drive our future growth. 
In closing, we continue to target average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% over the longer term. We believe we can achieve this through a combination of store growth, same-store sales gains, sustainable operating margins and the benefit to earnings per share from our ongoing stock repurchase program. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

So we're actually pretty pleased with how the new stores are coming on. And your second question was around where merchant buying costs might lever. As is our # 1 priority to obtain bargains for our customers, we continue to invest in the merchant group, and I think we'll continue to do that.

I mean, it seems like now, you're starting to lap outperformance in that category now for a little bit of time now. It's been a little bit more than a year now. So I guess my question is as you think about a lot of the department stores have been calling that out as a category of weakness, as we try to get a sense of if this is a long-term secular shift or not, what are you seeing in terms of the average basket size and units per transaction within that category? Do you get a sense that Juniors customer is putting entire outfits together at Ross, or is she really more supplementing her existing wardrobe with more incremental smaller purchases?"

I think Michael had mentioned in his comments that Juniors was one of our strongest-performing businesses in Q3. In fact, we've been very happy with the Juniors business over the last couple of years. Juniors has always been an important business area for us. We attract -- or within our demographics, we certainly have a number of younger customers, and they are attracted to that Juniors business. In terms of some of the subtleties of what you asked about, in terms of how are they shopping, I don't think we really have a sense of that. All we know is that, like our other customers, they're looking for a bargain, and clearly, we've been able to satisfy them over the past couple of years, and that's what's driven the success [ph] of that business."
