First, I take you to a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This",447,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. First, I take you to a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was due primarily to inventory losses in certain quality actions.  For the full year, adjusted gross margin finished at 38.5% which was in line with our revised guidance for the year.
Research and development expense in the fourth quarter was $67 million or 6.6% of revenue for the full year R&D expense was 6.4% of revenue.
SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $167 million or 16.5% of revenue. And for the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.7%. 
Adjusted operating income was $111 million compared to $142 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was within our revised guidance range at 16.5%.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.2%. This was due to a lower amount of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions and has brought our year-to-date effective tax rate to 20.5%, which was consistent with the effective tax rate last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.77 last year. And full year 2011 adjusted EPS on a diluted basis was $3.04.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the full year was $434 million compared to $315 million and generated in 2010. The increase this year is a result of lower comparative investments and working capital, which primarily reflect the timing of receivables collections and charge back payments related to U.S. sales of oxaliplatin, as well as a discretionary pension contribution that we made in 2010.
Capital spending was $291 million compared to $209 million in 2010. The increase reflects investments we are making relative to capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our pharmaceutical plant under construction in Visag, India.
Our cash balance at December 31 was $598 million, up from $527 million at September 30, but down slightly from $604 million at the end of last year.
Finally, on goodwill impairment, although we perform our goodwill impairment test annually, as of September 30, the decrease in our stock price in the fourth quarter and updated projections for 2012 triggered an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, we recognized additional goodwill impairment charges for the EMEA and APAC reporting segments.
Now before moving to guidance, Sumant will provide a brief update to our drug pipeline as we traditionally do at this time of the year. Sumant?"

You may recall that at our Investor Day in September of 2011 we revised how we present the pipeline to better reflect our strategy of globally expanding Hospira's portfolio. Instead of counting only the launches in limited major markets as previously did, we are now including all countries where the compounds in our pipeline are expected to launch.  So for today's update, which is based on our pipeline as of December 31, 2011 is relative to the pipeline we discussed with you on Investor Day which was as of June 30, 2011. 
As of December 31, 2011, our small molecule pipeline totaled 73 compounds, which represents a total of 603 new to country launches, including, 40 in the U.S. The local market value of the small molecule pipeline now stands out approximately $17 billion. 
In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly half of the total small molecule pipeline in terms of local market value are oncology drugs. With anti-infectives as the next largest therapeutic segment category at almost 1/4 of the pipeline's value.
Relative to launch timing, drugs representing slightly more than a quarter of the overall local market value of the pipeline are expected to launch in various countries across our regions in 2012 and 2013.
Of the local market value of expected launches for these 2 years, roughly 40% is expected to occur in 2012, with the remainder in 2013. 
While many of these drugs are smaller launches from a local market value perspective, they add incremental value to our broad portfolio which is already one of the largest portfolios of Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals worldwide.
Moving onto our Biosimilars pipeline, it remains to one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with 11 compounds and a global branded value of $40 billion.  We are already reaping benefits from our 2 Biosimilars is on the market. Our Biosimilar EPO, also known as Retacrit in Europe, and our Biosimilar Filgrastim, also known as Nivestim, that has launched in both Europe and Australia.
I now turn back the call to Tom, who will provide our 2012 financial guidance. Tom?"
9681063,145104049,257236,"Hospira Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2012",2012-02-14,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. I'd like to take you",1308,"Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. 
I'd like to take you through a couple of the assumptions we factored in to our net sales guidance.  First for Rocky Mount, at the lower end of our sales guidance range, we have assumed that production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. As we move up in the guidance range, we've assumed that the facility remains at 60% to 70% through the first half of the year, but that production and the pace of product release accelerate in the second half of the year.
Regarding other 483s, our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483s continue to make progress towards meeting the commitments communicating to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Now relative to product launches, first, those products launched in 2011, we anticipate further erosion for some of these drugs as more competitors enter the market. But we believe we can maintain strong market share positions, and in certain cases, even grow our market share.  We've also planned additional country rollouts of products already in our portfolio, including Precedex, docetaxel, gemcitabine, meropenem, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and propofol.
Now for new pipeline launches in 2012, while we expect to launch numerous smaller drugs this year across our regions, as Sumant indicated, there are no new major drug launches assumed in the guidance. Relative to oxaliplatin, we're assuming an August relaunch in the United States as per our settlement. However, our guidance assumes that the market will be significantly more competitive for the drug than it was when we temporarily exited the market in 2010 as part of our settlement with the originator.
On Symbiq, given that we cannot project the timeline for FDA approval of our 510(k) application, we have dialed in 2 assumptions to guidance for Symbiq. At the lower end of the range, we've assumed that Symbiq does not receive approval in 2012. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes approval by midyear, with sales in the second half of 2012. 
And finally, on Precedex we have assumed that we maintain market exclusivity in the United States throughout 2012.
Moving next to remediation costs, we expect these to remain in the $300 million to $375 million range that we highlighted on our last quarter call and at the JPMorgan conference in early January. As a reminder, that range includes costs related to both our pharma and device remediation activities. Now as far as the timing of these charges, we incurred $111 million of the $300 million to $375 million in the second half of 2011. Of the $111 million that we incurred in the second half of 2011, $76 million was recognized as one-time costs related primarily to third-party oversight and consulting costs, as well as costs associated with reduced production volumes at the Rocky Mount facility.  The remaining $35 million of the $111 million was recorded as ongoing charges, and this was primarily related to inventory losses.
Of the approximately $190 million to $265 million remaining of the $300 million to $375 million, we expect incur about 60% to 70% of these costs in 2012 with the remaining amount in 2013.  We do expect the proportion of one-time costs to ongoing costs to be more heavily weighted towards one time. In addition to these costs, we are also ramping up our permanent internal quality hiring efforts at our facilities.
Moving next to gross margins, adjusted gross margins in 2012 are projected to be in the 35% to 37% range compared to 38.5% for 2011 and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline relative to the full year of 2011 is expected to be driven by higher manufacturing costs related to reinforcing the foundation, lower volumes due to reduced output and some target inventory reductions. While continued price erosion on gemcitabine and docetaxel make for a difficult year-over-year comparison, we do expect lower inventory losses, as well as a positive mix effect from increased Precedex sales will offset most of that negative impact.
In 2012, we expect research and development and SG&A as a percentage of sales will both increase approximately 80 to 90 basis points. On the increase in R&D reflects the regulatory activities we are undertaking for our global SIP portfolio expansion, as well as advancements in our Biosimilars program. The increase in SG&A reflects investments we are making in information technology, intellectual property litigation and sales and marketing.
As a result of these factors, we're projecting 2012 adjusted operating income in the 12% to 13% range. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to decline in 2012  to a range of 18% to 20%, primarily due to lower earnings and higher tax rate jurisdictions in 2012 versus 2011. Equity income from affiliates will decline by roughly half due to lower expected revenues and related margins from docetaxel.
Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be steady at $166 million which does not include any share buyback activity or option exercises and we're projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.30.
Moving to cash flow, cash flow from operation projection for 2012 is in the range of $575 million to $625 million. Capital spending is projected to range between $350 million and $400 million, again primarily related to the new facility we're building in Visag, India, as well as modernization initiatives at some of our existing facilities.  Depreciation and amortization is expected to range between $240 million and $260 million.
In terms of quarterly calendarization, we expect that both net sales and adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year as a result of some of the factors I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Those are improved productivity levels at Rocky Mount, potential approval of our Symbiq 510(k) submission and the August relaunch of oxaliplatin. 
Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 5% to 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of our extended shutdown at the Rocky Mount facility in January.  We expect revenue to ramp up from first quarter levels over the remaining quarters of the year.
We expect adjusted gross margins to be up around 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011 and stay relatively flat throughout the year. Improvements to margins from increased production levels in the second half of the year are somewhat offset by scheduled factory maintenance shutdowns at some of our plants midyear and over the winter holidays.
For research and development, we expect a run rate every quarter in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales. SG&A, also should remain at an absolute run rate similar to the fourth quarter of 2011, with the exception of first quarter of 2012 which will be up due to the annual grants associated with our long-term incentive plans.
Now finally, I'd like to update you on our long-term financial goals. We remain confident that the earnings potential for the company remains strong. We're making progress with our remediation efforts, we believe that toward the end of the year, our production levels at Rocky Mount will increase and we will be releasing more product.  We expect improvements should accelerate as we complete our remediation efforts, commence manufacturing at our new factories in India and successfully launch our first Biosimilar in the U.S.  As we proceed through 2012, we hope to be able to quantify our longer-term financial goals.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some wrap up comments."

So we haven't assumed at 60% to 70% for the year accepting the lower end of the guidance. As far as the products in Rocky Mount, Rocky Mount produces a high number of anesthesiology drugs. I don't think there's any anti-infectives coming out of the facility to speak of. And the best list that you can probably look at to get an idea unfortunately is the drug shortage list. There are quite a few drugs coming out of Rocky Mount that are showing up on the list. Propofol comes out of our Claydon facility, so that's not impacted by Rocky Mount.

So it's the midpoint of the guidance $2.15 and assume that more comes in the second than in the first half then you have your traditional seasonality in Q3 that makes Q4 a little stronger. That puts Q4 in the $0.70 range, I think, and that would kind of lead to an annualized number below $3 on a normalize basis. Would you disagree with that math?"

The 2 more significant ones are oxaliplatin, which would happen in August, and then the relaunch of Symbiq which we're anticipating in the midrange, would be after the first half of the year. But trying to take that fourth quarter number and sort of projecting it out, I think it's premature to do that."

First, I'd take you to a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011.Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. T",445,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd take you to a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011.
Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was due primarily to inventory losses in certain quality actions.  For the full year, adjusted gross margin finished at 38.5% which was in line with our revised guidance for the year.
Research and development expense in the fourth quarter was $67 million or 6.6% of revenue. For the full year, R&D expense was 6.4% of revenue.
SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $167 million or 16.5% of revenue. And for the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.7%.
Adjusted operating income was $111 million compared to $142 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was within our revised guidance range at 16.5%.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.2%. This was due to a lower amount of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions, and this brought our year-to-date effective tax rate to 20.5%, which was consistent with the effective tax rate last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.77 last year. And full year 2011 adjusted EPS on a diluted basis was $3.04.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $434 million compared to $315 million generated in 2010. The increase this year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital, which primarily reflect the timing of receivables collections and charge-back payments related to U.S. sales of oxaliplatin, as well as a discretionary pension contribution that we made in 2010.
Capital spending was $291 million compared to $209 million in 2010. The increase reflects investments we are making relative to capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our pharmaceutical plant under construction in Visag, India.
Our cash balance at December 31 was $598 million, up from $527 million at September 30, but down slightly from $604 million at the end of last year.
Finally, on goodwill impairment. Although we perform our goodwill impairment test annually, as of September 30, the decrease in our stock price in the fourth quarter and updated projections for 2012, triggered an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, we recognized additional goodwill impairment charges for the EMEA and APAC reporting segments.
Now before moving to guidance, Sumant will provide a brief update to our drug pipeline as we traditionally do at this time of the year. Sumant?"

You may recall that on Investor Day in September of 2011, we revised how we present the pipeline to better reflect our strategy of globally expanding Hospira's portfolio.

You may recall that on Investor Day in September of 2011, we revised how we present the pipeline to better reflect our strategy of globally expanding Hospira's portfolio. Instead of counting only the launches in limited major markets, as we previously did, we are now including all countries where the compounds in our pipeline are expected to launch. So for today's update, which is based on our pipeline as of December 31, 2011, is relative to the pipeline we discussed with you on Investor Day which was as of June 30, 2011.
As of December 31, 2011, our small molecule pipeline totaled 73 compounds, which represents a total of 603 new-to-country launches, including 40 in the U.S. The local market value of the small molecule pipeline now stands out approximately $17 billion.  In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly half of the total small molecule pipeline, in terms of local market value, are oncology drugs. With anti-infectives as the next largest therapeutic segment category at almost 1/4 of the pipeline's value. Relative to launch timing, drugs representing slightly more than a quarter of the overall local market value of the pipeline are expected to launch in various countries across our regions in 2012 and 2013. Although local market value of the expected launches for these 2 years, roughly 40% is expected to occur in 2012, with the remainder in 2013. While many of these drugs are smaller launches from a local market value perspective, they add incremental value to our broad portfolio which is already one of the largest portfolios of Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals worldwide.
Moving onto our Biosimilars pipeline, it remains to one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with 11 compounds and a global branded value of $40 billion. We are already reaping benefits from our 2 Biosimilars on the market. Our Biosimilar EPO, also known as Retacrit in Europe, and our Biosimilar filgrastim, also known as Nivestim, that has launched in both Europe and Australia.
I now turn back the call to Tom, who will provide our 2012 financial guidance. Tom?"
9681063,145104049,257361,"Hospira Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2012",2012-02-14,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. I'd like to take you",1307,"Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. 
I'd like to take you through a couple of the assumptions we factored in to our net sales guidance. First for Rocky Mount, at the lower end of our sales guidance range, we have assumed that production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. As we move up in the guidance range, we've assumed that the facility remains at 60% to 70% through the first half of the year, but that production and the pace of product release accelerate in the second half of the year.  Regarding other 483s, our guidance assumes that other facilities, that currently have open 483s, continue to make progress towards meeting the commitments communicating to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Now relative to product launches. First, those products launched in 2011. We anticipate further erosion for some of these drugs as more competitors enter the market. But we believe we can maintain strong market share positions, and in certain cases, even grow our market share.  We've also planned additional country rollouts of products already in our portfolio, including Precedex, docetaxel, gemcitabine, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and propofol.
Now for new pipeline launches in 2012, while we expect to launch numerous smaller drugs this year across our regions, as Sumant indicated, there are no new major drug launches assumed in the guidance. Relative to oxaliplatin, we're assuming an August relaunch in the United States as per our settlement. However, our guidance assumes that the market will be significantly more competitive for the drug than it was when we temporarily exited the market in 2010 as part of our settlement with the originator. On Symbiq, given that we cannot project the timeline for FDA approval of our 510(k) application, we have dialed in 2 assumptions to guidance for Symbiq. At the lower end of the range, we've assumed that Symbiq does not receive approval in 2012. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes approval by midyear, with sales in the second half of 2012. And finally, on Precedex we have assumed that we maintain market exclusivity in the United States throughout 2012.
Moving next to remediation costs. We expect these to remain in the $300 million to $375 million range that we highlighted on our last quarter call and at the JPMorgan conference in early January. As a reminder, that range includes costs related to both our pharma and device remediation activities. Now as far as the timing of these charges, we incurred $111 million of the $300 million to $375 million in the second half of 2011. Of the $111 million that we incurred in the second half of 2011, $76 million was recognized as onetime costs related primarily to third-party oversight and consulting costs, as well as costs associated with reduced production volumes at the Rocky Mount facility. The remaining $35 million of the $111 million was recorded as ongoing charges, and this was primarily related to inventory losses. Of the approximately $190 million to $265 million remaining of the $300 million to $375 million, we expect to incur about 60% to 70% of these costs in 2012 with the remaining amount in 2013.  We do expect the proportion of onetime costs to ongoing costs to be more heavily weighted towards onetime. In addition to these costs, we are also ramping up our permanent internal quality hiring efforts at our facilities.
Moving next to gross margins. Adjusted gross margins in 2012 are projected to be in the 35% to 37% range compared to 38.5% for 2011 and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline, relative to the full year of 2011, is expected to be driven by higher manufacturing costs related to reinforcing the foundation, lower volumes due to reduced output and some target inventory reductions. While continued price erosion on gemcitabine and docetaxel make for a difficult year-over-year comparison, we do expect lower inventory losses, as well as a positive mix effect from increased Precedex sales, will offset most of that negative impact.
In 2012, we expect research and development, and SG&A as a percentage of sales, will both increase approximately 80 to 90 basis points. Now the increase in R&D reflects the regulatory activities we are undertaking for our global SIP portfolio expansion, as well as advancements in our Biosimilars program. The increase in SG&A reflects investments we are making in information technology, intellectual property litigation and sales and marketing. As a result of these factors, we're projecting 2012 adjusted operating income in the 12% to 13% range. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to decline in 2012. To a range of 18% to 20%, primarily due to lower earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions in 2012 versus 2011. Equity income from affiliates will decline by roughly half due to lower expected revenues and related margins from docetaxel.
Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be steady at $166 million which does not include any share buyback activity or option exercises and we're projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.30.
Moving to cash flow, cash flow from operation projection for 2012 is in the range of $575 million to $625 million. Capital spending is projected to range between $350 million and $400 million, again, primarily related to the new facility we're building in Visag, India, as well as modernization initiatives at some of our existing facilities.  Depreciation and amortization is expected to range between $240 million and $260 million.
In terms of quarterly calendarization, we expect that both net sales and adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year as a result of some of the factors I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Those are improved productivity levels at Rocky Mount, potential approval of our Symbiq 510(k) submission and the August relaunch of oxaliplatin.
Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 5% to 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of our extended shutdown at the Rocky Mount facility in January.  We expect revenue to ramp up from first quarter levels over the remaining quarters of the year.
We expect adjusted gross margins to be up around 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011 and stay relatively flat throughout the year. Improvements to margins from increased production levels in the second half of the year are somewhat offset by scheduled factory maintenance shutdowns at some of our plants, midyear, and over the winter holidays.
For research and development, we expect a run rate every quarter in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales. SG&A, also should remain at an absolute run rate similar to the fourth quarter of 2011, with the exception of first quarter of 2012 which will be up due to the annual grants associated with our long-term incentive plans.
Now finally, I'd like to update you on our long-term financial goals. We remain confident that the earnings potential for the company remains strong. We're making progress with our remediation efforts, we believe that, toward the end of the year, our production levels at Rocky Mount will increase and we will be releasing more product.  We expect improvements should accelerate as we complete our remediation efforts, commence manufacturing at our new factories in India and successfully launch our first Biosimilar in the U.S. As we proceed through 2012, we hope to be able to quantify our longer-term financial goals.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some wrap-up comments."

I know you guys don't want to talk specifically about where it is,  but I think it will be helpful, just when you think about the operating expense base that you guys envision between R&D and SG&A this year. Should we be thinking that, going forward even as these remediation -- as you work to these problems, that that's a good level to about and then the high-volume leverage off of that going forward as things recover or are there more -- could we see more expenses come off as we get into 2013 and beyond just depending on the pace of remediation?"

The selling expenses, depending on portfolio expansion where our new Head of Commercial would like to take the various regions -- I'd kind of hold off on commenting what selling expenses might look like another component of that, but there should be some leverage in SG&A.

So I just look at the midpoint of the guidance, it's sort of $2.15 and assume that more comes in the second than in the first half and then you have your traditional seasonality in Q3 that makes Q4 a little stronger.

We had the shutdowns in the third quarter and our launches. We said there was not much in the way of launches in 2012. The 2 more significant ones are oxaliplatin, which would happen in August, and then the relaunch of Symbiq, which we're anticipating in the midrange, would be after the first half of the year.

First, I'd take you through a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011.Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 20",444,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd take you through a brief review of the income statement for the fourth quarter and 2011.
Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was due primarily to inventory losses and certain quality actions. For the full year, adjusted gross margin finished at 38.5% which was in line with our revised guidance for the year.
Research and development expense in the fourth quarter was $67 million or 6.6% of revenue. For the full year, R&D expense was 6.4% of revenue.
SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $167 million or 16.5% of revenue. And for the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.7%.
Adjusted operating income was $111 million compared to $142 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was within our revised guidance range at 16.5%.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.2%. This was due to a lower amount of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions, and this brought our year-to-date effective tax rate to 20.5%, which was consistent with the effective tax rate last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.77 last year. And full year 2011 adjusted EPS on a diluted basis was $3.04.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $434 million compared to $315 million generated in 2010. The increase this year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital, which primarily reflect the timing of receivables collections and chargeback payments related to U.S. sales of oxaliplatin, as well as a discretionary pension contribution that we made in 2010.
Capital spending was $291 million compared to $209 million in 2010. The increase reflects investments we are making relative to capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our pharmaceutical plant under construction in Vizag, India.
Our cash balance at December 31 was $598 million, up from $527 million at September 30, but down slightly from $604 million at the end of last year.
Finally, on goodwill impairment. Although we perform our goodwill impairment test annually, as of September 30, the decrease in our stock price in the fourth quarter and updated projections for 2012 triggered an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, we recognized additional goodwill impairment charges for the EMEA and APAC reporting segments.
Now before moving to guidance, Sumant will provide a brief update to our drug pipeline as we traditionally do at this time of the year. Sumant?"

You may recall that on our Investor Day in September of 2011, we revised how we present the pipeline to better reflect our strategy of globally expanding Hospira's portfolio. Instead of counting only the launches in limited major markets, as we previously did, we are now including all countries where the compounds in our pipeline are expected to launch. So for today's update, which is based on our pipeline as of December 31, 2011, is relative to the pipeline we discussed with you on Investor Day which was as of June 30, 2011.
As of December 31, 2011, our small molecule pipeline totaled 73 compounds, which represents a total of 603 new-to-country launches, including 40 in the U.S. The local market value of the small molecule pipeline now stands at approximately $17 billion.  In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly half of the total small molecule pipeline, in terms of local market value, are oncology drugs, with anti-infectives as the next largest therapeutic segment category at almost 1/4 of the pipeline's value. Relative to launch timing, drugs representing slightly more than a quarter of the overall local market value of the pipeline are expected to launch in various countries across our regions in 2012 and 2013. Of the local market value of the expected launches for these 2 years, roughly 40% is expected to occur in 2012, with the remainder in 2013. While many of these drugs are smaller launches from a local market value perspective, they add incremental value to our broad portfolio, which is already one of the largest portfolios of Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals worldwide.
Moving onto our biosimilars pipeline, it remains to one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with 11 compounds and a global branded value of $40 billion. We are already reaping benefits from our 2 biosimilars on the market. Our biosimilar EPO, also known as Retacrit in Europe, and our biosimilar filgrastim, also known as Nivestim, that has launched in both Europe and Australia.

For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. I'd like to take you",1309,"Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. 
I'd like to take you through a couple of the assumptions we factored in to our net sales guidance. First for Rocky Mount, at the lower end of our sales guidance range, we have assumed that production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. As we move up in the guidance range, we've assumed that the facility remains at 60% to 70% through the first half of the year but that production and the pace of product release accelerate in the second half of the year.  Regarding other 483s, our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483s continue to make progress towards meeting the commitments communicating to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Now relative to product launches. First, those products launched in 2011. We anticipate further erosion for some of these drugs as more competitors enter the market. But we believe we can maintain strong market share positions, and in certain cases, even grow our market share.  We've also planned additional country rollouts of products already in our portfolio, including Precedex, docetaxel, gemcitabine, meropenem, piperacillin, tazobactam and propofol.
Now for new pipeline launches in 2012, while we expect to launch numerous smaller drugs this year across our regions, as Sumant indicated, there are no new major drug launches assumed in the guidance. Relative to oxaliplatin, we're assuming an August relaunch in the United States as per our settlement. However, our guidance assumes that the market will be significantly more competitive for the drug than it was when we temporarily exited the market in 2010 as part of our settlement with the originator. On Symbiq, given that we cannot project the time line for FDA approval of our 510(k) application, we have dialed in 2 assumptions to guidance for Symbiq. At the lower end of the range, we've assumed that Symbiq does not receive approval in 2012. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes approval by midyear, with sales in the second half of 2012. And finally, on Precedex, we have assumed that we maintain market exclusivity in the United States throughout 2012.
Moving next to remediation costs. We expect these to remain in the $300 million to $375 million range that we highlighted on our last quarter call and at the JPMorgan conference in early January. As a reminder, that range includes costs related to both our pharma and device remediation activities. Now as far as the timing of these charges, we incurred $111 million of the $300 million to $375 million in the second half of 2011. Of the $111 million that we incurred in the second half of 2011, $76 million was recognized as onetime costs related primarily to third-party oversight and consulting costs, as well as costs associated with reduced production volumes at the Rocky Mount facility. The remaining $35 million of the $111 million was recorded as ongoing charges, and this was primarily related to inventory losses. Of the approximately $190 million to $265 million remaining of the $300 million to $375 million, we expect to incur about 60% to 70% of these costs in 2012 with the remaining amount in 2013.  We do expect the proportion of onetime costs to ongoing costs to be more heavily weighted towards onetime. In addition to these costs, we are also ramping up our permanent internal quality hiring efforts at our facilities.
Moving next to gross margins. Adjusted gross margins in 2012 are projected to be in the 35% to 37% range compared to 38.5% for 2011 and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline, relative to the full year of 2011, is expected to be driven by higher manufacturing costs related to reinforcing the foundation, lower volumes due to reduced output and some targeted inventory reductions. While continued price erosion on gemcitabine and docetaxel make for a difficult year-over-year comparison, we do expect lower inventory losses, as well as a positive mix effect from increased Precedex sales, will offset most of that negative impact.
In 2012, we expect research and development, and SG&A as a percentage of sales, will both increase approximately 80 to 90 basis points. Now the increase in R&D reflects the regulatory activities we are undertaking for our global SIP portfolio expansion, as well as advancements in our biosimilars program. The increase in SG&A reflects investments we are making in information technology, intellectual property litigation and sales and marketing. As a result of these factors, we're projecting 2012 adjusted operating income in the 12% to 13% range. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to decline in 2012 to a range of 18% to 20%, primarily due to lower earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions in 2012 versus 2011. Equity income from affiliates will decline by roughly half due to lower expected revenues and related margins from docetaxel.
Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be steady at $166 million which does not include any share buyback activity or option exercises, and we're projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.30.
Moving to cash flow, cash flow from operations projection for 2012 is in the range of $575 million to $625 million. Capital spending is projected to range between $350 million and $400 million, again, primarily related to the new facility we're building in Vizag, India, as well as modernization initiatives at some of our existing facilities.  Depreciation and amortization is expected to range between $240 million and $260 million.
In terms of quarterly calendarization, we expect that both net sales and adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year as a result of some of the factors I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Those are improved productivity levels at Rocky Mount, potential approval of our Symbiq 510(k) submission and the August relaunch of oxaliplatin.
Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 5% to 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of our extended shutdown at the Rocky Mount facility in January.  We expect revenue to ramp up from first quarter levels over the remaining quarters of the year.
We expect adjusted gross margins to be up around 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011 and stay relatively flat throughout the year. Improvements to margins from increased production levels in the second half of the year are somewhat offset by scheduled factory maintenance shutdowns at some of our plants, midyear, and over the winter holidays.
For research and development, we expect a run rate every quarter in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales. SG&A also should remain at an absolute run rate similar to the fourth quarter of 2011, with the exception of first quarter of 2012 which will be up due to the annual grants associated with our long-term incentive plans.
Now finally, I'd like to update you on our long-term financial goals. We remain confident that the earnings potential for the company remains strong. We're making progress with our remediation efforts, we believe that, toward the end of the year, our production levels at Rocky Mount will increase and we will be releasing more product. We expect improvements should accelerate as we complete our remediation efforts, commence manufacturing at our new factories in India and successfully launch our first biosimilar in the U.S. As we proceed through 2012, we hope to be able to quantify our longer-term financial goals.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some wrap-up comments."

I don't think there's any anti-infectives coming out of the facility to speak of. And the best list that you can probably look at, to get an idea, unfortunately is the drug shortage list. There are quite a few drugs coming out of Rocky Mount that are showing up on the list. Propofol comes out of our Clayton facility, so that's not impacted by Rocky Mount.

And then secondly, just Tom, I think to that earnings base question. I know you guys don't want to talk specifically about where it is,  but I think it will be helpful, just when you think about the operating expense base that you guys envision between R&D and SG&A this year. Should we be thinking that, going forward even as these remediation -- as you work through these problems that, that's a good level to about, and then you'll have volume leverage off of that going forward as things recover or are there more -- could we see more expenses come off as we get into 2013 and beyond just depending on the pace of remediation?"

The selling expenses, depending on portfolio expansion, where our new Head of Commercial would like to take the various regions -- I'd kind of hold off on commenting what selling expenses might look like another component of that, but there should be some leverage in SG&A.

Good morning, everyone welcome to our first quarter 2012 conference call. 
I will begin today's call by providing you with an update on our quality remediation efforts and growth initiatives followed by a discussion of our first quarter sales results, which like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations. Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with the discussion on guidance.
As I've said before, reinforcing the foundation is our number one priority and that has not changed. On the quality front, as we progress with our remediation and move forward towards recovery, we are uprooting and resolving issues, we are preparing and responding to various FDA inspections, and with our strength in leadership, we are working cross functionally across our plants to share best practices and to put the highest quality processes and procedures in place.
Let's start with Rocky Mount. First, we remain on track with our remediation efforts at the plant. As we indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are currently maintaining our production and release levels in the 60% to 70% range and anticipate that we will remain at these levels through at least midyear.
Second, we are also making progress with our hiring efforts at Rocky. We have placed over 100 full-time employees at the plant since the beginning of the year. This is in addition to the more than 150 consultants we already have working on the plant floor with our employees assisting us with our remediation efforts. We expect these consultants to remain with us for most of the year, after which we expect to steadily ramp down as our internal staff takes over many of the roles and responsibilities the consultants have been performing for us.
And finally, we have continued our regular constructive dialogues with the FDA regarding our current progress at rocky and continued to press forward with implementation of our remediation plan. The agency has told us they are willing to meet with us to discuss our plan and we are communicating with them to finalize the date.
Moving to our other Pharma facilities. At our Clayton plant, which is also cited under the Warning Letter with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted an inspection in March. The inspection was not a full cGMP audit but a limited inspection focused on a specific issue. The agency had one observation regarding how we conduct investigations, which we did not deem to be critical in nature. We have already addressed and completed the corrective action for this observation.
In addition, during the month of March, we encountered some manufacturing issues at the plant and elected to shut down production to investigate. This has created a temporary shortage situation with propofol and has also impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. Last week, we completed the corrective action, which we believe addresses the issue. We have restarted production and will begin a staged release of quarantined product in the coming weeks.
At our Austin plant, we Discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call that we had retained Lockman, a third-party consulting firm, to audit the completion of the plant's corrective actions. They concluded that all of the commitments we made to the agency in our action plan had been fully completed. In March, we received from the FTA what is referred to as an untitled letter. The letter clarified the agency's expectations regarding the scope of some of our corrective actions we took to resolve the observations in the 483 they issued last year. We have responded to the letter with our plan to address their concerns and with the additional corrective actions in place, we'll be better prepared for their next inspection.
At our Lake Forest facility, the FDA recently performed an inspection of our stability maps and our adverse events reporting process, and concluded the inspection with 0 observations. On the device side of the house, the FDA recently inspected both of our device plants.
Our Dominican Republic plant received 0 observations and our Costa Rica plant received 4 observations, none of which we deem critical and 2 of which were addressed prior to the completion of the inspection.
To wrap up our quality discussion, I'll take a minute to welcome John Eliot as our new Senior Vice President of Operations. John is a very and global leader with more than 35 years of manufacturing experience and he has advised some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. He's a great addition to our strength and quality in operations organizations and will bring you insights and leadership to help us reinforce our foundation and drive growth.
I am very excited with the addition of new team members now reporting to me. Richard Davis is our new Chief Commercial Officer, Zina Coffman is our new Head of Quality; and now John Eliot is our new Head of Operations.
Before turning to the sales result, I'll briefly mention that we also advanced our growth initiatives during the quarter. We began the registration process for several of the drugs targeted for our global expansion program in addition to working on several other growth initiatives, including advancing our biosimilar programs. And our partner, , delivered a major milestone with the European filing of infliximab in the quarter.
Finally, on another positive note, we were pleased with yesterday's positive outcome regarding Precedex. The judge ruled in our favor on the 2013 patent, which provides us exclusivity through the life of the patent. They are currently conducting pediatric trials which would extend the patent exclusivity by 6 months into early 2014. While we were disappointed with the judge's decision regarding our 2019 ICU sedation patent, we believe in the strength of our patent and we'll take appropriate legal actions to continue our defense on this patent. 
I'll now turn to our sales results to the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results will be a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
By product line, Global Specialty Injectables net sales decreased 8% for the quarter. 
By region, in the Americas, Specialty Injectable sales were down 10% to the first quarter. The decline related mainly to 2 factors. First, docetaxel. If you recall, we launched docetaxel in the first quarter of 2011, which made for a difficult year-over-year comparison. Despite the tough comps, docetaxel actually held up extremely well in the quarter. No new competitors entered the market which enabled us to maintain our market share of close to 50%. Pricing remains fairly rational, declining to approximately 60% of the branded product pricing. The second factor was the impact of supply issues, primarily driven by remediation activities, which affected several of our products including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs.
Partially offset a Decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter.
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of Specialty Injectables were up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Meropenem performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We have launched the product in most major countries in Western Europe and have captured a leading market share position overall in the region. Nivestim, our biosimilar also had a strong quarter in many of our EMEA markets. It has performed particularly well in France where we recently added additional sales staff to support the product, which we believe is the fastest growing biosimilar in that country.
In Asia-Pacific, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 13% in the quarter. While market demand is still strong, we had some difficult year-over-year comparisons due to the timing of wholesale or buying patterns in Australia, our largest country in our Asia-Pacific region. 
In Japan, net sales trends for Precedex remained strong. 
Turning now to medication management. Global net sales increased 7% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of strong built-up demand for device sales. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive FDA clearance for our 5 10-K applications for the upgraded Symbiq software and have begun working with customers to upgrade the installed base of Symbiq devices with a new software. We expect to begin shipments to a select number of new customers later this quarter.
We also continued to make progress on our comprehensive device review by conducting additional investigations to drive costs and implement appropriate actions.
Sales in our other Pharma product line were relatively flat in the first quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. Strong demand by certain third-party customers was offset by the impact of the quality remediation actions we have been taking at our Pharma manufacturing facilities and the resulting blades in product release.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow, and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike.

I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow, and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike. 
Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales, net sales for the quarter was 37.0%, which was down from 42.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This is primarily due to causes associated with our quality initiatives, including some inventory losses, as well as price declines on 2011 U.S. launches and oncology products in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
As expected, R&D expense in the quarter increased 21% to $69 million over last year, primarily as a result of higher clinical trials spending, as well as the initiation of our global expansion program.
R&D as a percentage of net sales was 7.2% of revenue compared to 5.7% for the first quarter of 2011. 
SG&A expense for the first quarter was $184 million, up 12% from $165 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased sales and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses.
As a result, adjusted operating income was $104 million compared to $203 million in the first quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 10.8% compared to 20.3% of net sales in last year's first quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% in the first quarter last year. The reduced tax rate in the 3 months ended March 31 resulted from increased quality and product-related expenses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, combined with a greater mix of operating income in lower or tax-free jurisdictions. 
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.93 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $87 million compared to $6 million for the same period in 2011. The increase this year is the result of or the increase over last year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital including inventory and the timing of receivables collections which more than offset the decline in net income. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $67 million compared to $62 million in the first quarter of last year. And the spending this quarter includes the investments we are making relative to our capacity events and efforts, primarily at our new Pharma plant that is being built in, India. 
Our cash balance at March 31 was $656 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year and $597 million at March 31 of last year.
Next, turning to our full year guidance. We are maintaining all data points that we provided on our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call in February of this year. We are maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange contributing a negative 1%. Adjusted gross margin projections remain in the range of 35% to 37%, and adjusted operating margins in the range of 12% to 13%. This translates into adjusted EPS guidance of $2 to $2.30 per share.
I'd also like to remind you some of the assumptions we've provided when we delivered our 2012 guidance in February versus where we are today. First, for Rocky Mount. The lower end of our guidance range assumes that Rocky's production, Rocky Mount's production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. Moving up in the guidance range assumes that the facility remains at 60% to 70% to the first half of the year but that production and the pace of product release accelerates in the second half of the year.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, one of the key factors relative to the guidance range is our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdowns at many of our pharma plants, which occur annually in early July. As we progressed with our remediation efforts, we continue to find and respond to issues, and as Mike said, we want to address any and all issues now to get the foundation fully fixed rather than waiting until later. Therefore, when we shut the plants down in the third quarter, early in the third quarter for preventive maintenance, we may take advantage of these shutdowns as we did in the first quarter by possibly extending them and the downtime work -- and the downtime to work on any additional issues we may uncover.
Next regarding other 483s. Our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483's continue to make progress toward meeting the commitments communicated through the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Next related to Symbiq, the midpoint of our guidance range assumed approval, FDA approval of Symbiq by midyear, with sales beginning in the second half of the year. Relative to the second quarter, while we do anticipate some new sales, we are initially focused on remediating pumps that are already in the field and filling previously signed customer orders, which really won't have a significant impact on our guidance.
And finally with respect to docetaxel, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor regarding the 2013 patent. And we are maintaining our guidance assumption that with an extension of the patent for our pediatric studies, we will retain market exclusivity in the U.S. until early 2014.
The remaining assumptions for the full year revenue guidance we outlined on the fourth quarter call remain unchanged.
In terms of calendarization, we expect adjusted gross margin in the second half of the year to be slightly weaker than the first half of the year, again, as the second half will be impacted by our scheduled preventive maintenance shutdowns. For R&D, we expect the full year to remain in the 7.0 to 7.5 percentage of net sales range. But based on the timing of clinical trials spending, R&D absolute dollars should rise in the second and third quarter. SG&A should ramp down approximately 5% to 8% in absolute dollars from the first quarter and then remain fairly flat throughout the year.
As a result, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be relatively flat with the first quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final wrapup comments."

The first quarter was a busy one for us. We remain highly focused on our remediation efforts as I am determined that we're going to get this fixed and meet the FDA's expectations. We're also going been communicating regularly and working diligently with the FDA and our customers to help manage the industry worldwide drug shortage situation. I'll take this opportunity to say that we greatly appreciate the FDA's cooperation and our customers patience in this regard. We continued to drive our growth programmed and to tap into the many growth opportunities that exist for Hospira.
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we still have a lot of work to do relative to our quality initiatives. We've made a lot of progress. We have a great team in place and remain in control of the process, but there are still a number of unknowns out there. I told you before I like the process to one of draining the swamp. Sometimes means you find gators, you didn't know existed. As we travel down the road to recovery, issues are surfacing and we are jumping into action to resolve them. I'll reiterate that I am committed to getting our foundation fixed over the short-term, and when we do, Hospira will have an even greater competitive position in the industry. That plus the work we're doing to capitalize on our tremendous growth opportunities is positioning Hospira for longer-term success as the world-leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies. It's an exciting and challenging journey and one I'm very excited to be leading.
With that, operator, we are ready for questions."

We feel that we will, in this quarter or certainly before the next call, we feel we will have an opportunity to get a face-to-face meeting with them. And obviously then we can give you an update as to what occurs then. So it's simply been a scheduling issue with respect to the FDA. Turning to your second question on what then gets our ramp from 60% to 70% up to something higher, essentially, I believe, it's uncovering these issues, getting our plants up in terms of first pass quality, getting the tough exception reports that we need to get through to our labs behind us and getting to more of a free-flow of product. So as we continued to go through our remediation, we are uncovering issues. This causes then slowdown in our manufacturing or a backup behind our lab as we seek to ensure that the products are safe and effective. Once we get through this particular period, I believe that the plans will, or at least Rocky Mount will get better than at the release process we will have less issues as we've taken care of the issues, and then we should start to see a ramp-up in terms of supply. I should also say that products supply is somewhat dependent upon the amount of remediation that we have to do. As we find things, a lot of times, we have to divert resources away from the products apply area into looking at detailed remediation on a specific issue, and this causes a slowdown in the system. So again, as we get these remediation efforts behind us, I believe we will see a ramp-up then from the 60% to 70% level."

And depending on how you look at it, it could be but more than that. And we had been running, I think, if you normalized our margins for, as well as some of the early quality issues we began to have in 2010, nearest I could tell, we were running normally around 41%, 42%. So we've seen at least a 300 basis point off, I think it's slightly more then that depending how you look at it. Whatever it is, we're not intending to sort of stop there and have a permanent.
[Audio Gap]
Impact to the cost structure. As Mike said, the key here is getting our first pass quality up so that we're not writing, we call them exception of reports or basically production deviation reports where something isn't right with the production or something's not right with the documentation. I've been through quality training before, and the cost of quality, when you can get the first pass quality, it's a --  I won't say it's exponential but it's a magnitude in cost savings on what you think you're actually spending. So we've had to add these cost ins, some of them are people, the consultants will go way towards the end-of-the-year, early next year as Mike said, we're going to get more efficient with the existing people we have. We're adding automation. We will begin to modernize particularly Rocky Mount, potentially some of these other factors update more efficiencies but the key is getting to first pass quality and that's where we intend to drive to get our costs back in line because we can't stand still with the cost structure we have right now, this is just going to take some time."

With respect to Clayton, as I said, there was an issue there, the FDA came into to look at and we responded very well to that particular issue. And then as we turn to Costa Rica, again, more observations, 2 which were handled right on the spot, 2 which we did not deem to be critical. So as we look at it, we take it as an overall positive. Obviously, I want to a place where we are not getting 483s decrease, but the 483's that we seemed to be getting now and the general inspection results that we're getting seems to be that we are making progress on that front."

We don't see anything in Rocky right at this moment, which would say, gee, we're going to have to have an extended shutdown. What we're referring to in that third quarter shutdown is that it does represent an opportunity, which we will take if we see an advantage to it to get some major things fixed or something that is easier to get fixed during a shutdown. So that was the purpose behind our statement. So nothing I see right now, but if the opportunity presents itself, we will not hesitate to move forward and get this thing fixed even if it impacts our ability to on service levels."

So this is how we have defined it for our organization. On the first then, what we are trying to do obviously is all these initiatives that we pointed out around quality to get the foundation very solid. But what I want to ensure is that when we do have that foundation solid and fixed, that there are great growth opportunities out there. So we can't let the whole organization be dragged down, fixing the foundation route, we need to have a lot of the organization focused on the opportunities that are in front of us. So as we've basically the work, what we've done is added a considerable amount of expertise, and talent and people into this reinforcing the foundation idea. And as you look at the new hires that we brought in, be it our new head of quality, Zina Coffman or our new head of operations, John Eliot, they bring in heavy experience. And below them, we are also bringing in the talent there. And it's those folks then, and they are hitting the ground running that we're tasking with this reinforcing the foundation. I should also say that these individuals also have a great deal of credibility with the FDA. So I believe that the agency sees both of that level and levels below them highly credible people doing those positions and those jobs extremely well. So moving that to the aside and then, we have a number of initiatives on this turbocharged growth idea, which is essentially our globalization platform. So I talked about in the prepared remarks that we are moving ahead with globalization, and you heard Tom talked about the increase in research development, up over 20% over last year. So we are putting funds behind that. We are also getting behind our biosimilars program, in addition to continuing with developing our SIP pipeline and our IV clinical integration. So I do believe that the organization has enough bandwidth to achieve these things. So we've got part of the organization dedicated to fixing this foundation, another part dedicated to ensuring that we take the opportunities, opportunity with the great, great potential that we have as a company. We've also said, of the 2 then right now, if we have to, let's say, on the third quarter, take longer to fix certain issues in Rocky Mount, we will do that. Because at the end of the day, if we've got the solid foundation then, we've got excellent opportunities to move forward. So I think with the new folks coming in on the fixed the foundation side or reinforce the foundation, they are excellent. Now they turn to turbocharged growth, I mentioned Richard Davis who we hired firm Amgen, who is our Chief Commercial Officer, who is truly a global executive. And so we have him right now out in the international parts of our business. He has not been in the U.S. much. He's basically been out in the international arena looking at how we grow our business. But we're not waiting, we know that the opportunities there by expanding the number of products we market, so we're working diligently in R&D to do that. So I think we've now brought in great expertise into the organization that is helping us with both things and we're moving aggressively on those opportunities front. And that's why I want to continue to investing in this thing because once we do get this supply issue behind us, and it is not a question of if, it's simply a question of when. It is difficult to say when, but when we do we will have these opportunities then in front of us that we'll be able to take full advantage of."

Inventories are going to come down during the year, that's still the plan. The reason they're up we still have some inventory sitting in Rocky Mount in quarantine, and that's largely the cost for the increase there. So we'll get that worked back down. The shutdowns will naturally bring some of the down automatically but the build, the increase in inventory, there's no intentional build there in anticipation of shutdown. We have plenty of inventory on products where we don't need it. If we don't have enough products where we do need it so it's getting it back and balanced and then break in the bottlenecks or the log jam in Rocky Mount. And relative to sales, I think the standby our guidance of down 1 to up 2. And in terms of how that cadences out, you can look at previous years, the fourth quarter is always the strongest for us, certainly, we have to execute on some product releases but we're sticking with the guidance and how that plays out, I think historically is probably a good way to look at it."

I think just to be absolutely clear, we cannot predict what is going to happen with respect to any consent decree, whether it will or will not happen. So I want to be clear on that point. What I can tell is we've no discussions with the agency around a consent decree. And if we had, we would have informed you. So I wanted to just put that on the table. We do continue a very constructive dialogue with the agency. I'm obviously, looking to finalize time to meet with them on a face-to-face basis to go over our remediation plan. And again, I am hoping that will be in the second quarter or at least before the next call. And as you pointed out, in the meantime, we're doing everything we can. So I think the agency is definitely looking at safety and we have the interim controls to ensure product safety. We've got this 150 consultants at Rocky Mount looking at doing oversight, training, remediation, helping us with supply. I think they also, the agency that is, looks at what are you investing behind this? We are investing a tremendous amount of money behind both human capital, equipment and the facility in order to ensure that we are driving towards sustainable change and to keep in rhythm with that culture change. We also have brand-new management. And as I mentioned before, I believe this new management has a tremendous amount of credibility with the FDA. On the remediation front, we continued to progress so when we do get front of the agency, we will be able to point out to them just how much progress we've made there. And with respect to the number of inspections we've had, I take that as a good sign because we're able to show, I believe, that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned I think that quarter 1, actually, when you look at the number of inspections, and I believe how well the organization did, given that no 483 is a good one, but given that's an improvement of where we've been in the past, I think this is actually a positive and absent third parties out to make sure that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned before, we have locked out reviewing our commitments. We've had other third-party consultants reviewing our labs across the U.S. network. We are currently doing our quality units with a third party to ensure that we are living up to our commitments there. And then I think at the end of the day, the agency looks at the CEO to say, is the CEO involved or committed? And I can tell you I am committed to this process and we are doing everything we can to demonstrate that and doing everything we can to communicate that. So on that basis, if we are judged by our actions right now, I feel we are doing everything we can, but at the end of the day, there is no guarantee at all about the consent decree one way or the other."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2012 conference call. 
I will begin today's call by providing you with an update on our quality remediation efforts and growth initiatives followed by a discussion of our first quarter sales results which, like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations. Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with the discussion on guidance.
As I've said before, reinforcing the foundation is our #1 priority and that has not changed. On the quality front, as we progress with our remediation and move forward towards recovery, we are uprooting and resolving issues, we are preparing and responding to various FDA inspections. And with our strength in leadership, we are working across -- functionally across our plants to share best practices and to put the highest quality processes and procedures in place.
Let's start with Rocky Mount. First, we remain on track with our remediation efforts at the plant. As we indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are currently maintaining our production and release levels in the 60% to 70% range and anticipate that we will remain at these levels through at least midyear.
Second, we are also making progress with our hiring efforts at Rocky. We have placed over 100 full-time employees at the plant since the beginning of the year. This is in addition to the more than 150 consultants we already have working on the plant floor, with our employees assisting us with our remediation efforts. We expect these consultants to remain with us for most of the year, after which we expect to steadily ramp down as our internal staff takes over many of the roles and responsibilities the consultants have been performing for us.
And finally, we have had continued -- we have continued our regular constructive dialogues with the FDA regarding our current progress at Rocky and continued to press forward with implementation of our remediation plan. The agency has told us they are willing to meet with us to discuss our plan, and we are communicating with them to finalize a date.
Moving to our Other Pharma facilities. At our Clayton plant, which is also cited under the Warning Letter with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted an inspection in March. The inspection was not a full cGMP audit but a limited inspection focused on a specific issue. The agency had one observation regarding how we conduct investigations, which we did not deem to be critical in nature. We have already addressed and completed the corrective action for this observation.
In addition, during the month of March, we encountered some manufacturing issues at the plant and elected to shut down production to investigate. This has created a temporary shortage situation with propofol and has also impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. Last week, we completed the corrective action, which we believe addresses the issue. We have restarted production and will begin a staged release of quarantined product in the coming weeks.
At our Austin plant, we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call that we had retained Lachman, a third-party consulting firm, to audit the completion of the plant's corrective actions. They concluded that all of the commitments we made to the agency in our action plan had been fully completed. In March, we received from the FDA what is referred to as an untitled letter. The letter clarified the agency's expectations regarding the scope of some of our corrective actions we took to resolve the observations in the 483 they issued last year. We have responded to the letter with our plan to address their concerns. And with the additional corrective actions in place, we'll be better prepared for their next inspection.
At our Lake Forest facility, the FDA recently performed an inspection of our stability labs and our adverse events reporting process, and concluded the inspection with 0 observation. On the device side of the house, the FDA recently inspected both of our device plants. Our Dominican Republic plant received 0 observation and our Costa Rica plant received 4 observations, none of which we deem critical and 2 of which were addressed prior to the completion of the inspection.
To wrap up our quality discussion, I'll take a minute to welcome John Elliot as our new Senior Vice President of Operations. John is a very seasoned global leader with more than 35 years of manufacturing experience, and he has advised some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. He's a great addition to our strength and quality in operations organization and will bring new insights and leadership to help us reinforce our foundation and drive growth.
I am very excited with the addition of new team members now reporting to me. Richard Davies is our new Chief Commercial Officer. Zena Kaufman is our new Head of Quality. And now, John Elliot is our new Head of Operations.
Before turning to the sales result, I'll briefly mention that we also advanced our growth initiatives during the quarter. We began the registration process for several of the drugs targeted for our global expansion program in addition to working on several other growth initiatives, including advancing our biosimilar programs. And our partner, Celltrion, delivered a major milestone with the European filing of infliximab in the quarter.
Finally, on another positive note, we were pleased with yesterday's positive outcome regarding Precedex. The judge ruled in our favor on the 2013 enantiomer patent, which provides us exclusivity through the life of the patent. We are currently conducting pediatric trials, which would extend the patent exclusivity by 6 months into early 2014. While we were disappointed with the judge's decision regarding our 2019 ICU sedation patent, we believe in the strength of our patent and we'll take appropriate legal actions to continue our defense on this patent. 
I'll now turn to our sales results for the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2011. By product line, Global Specialty Injectable net sales decreased 8% for the quarter. 
By region, in the Americas, specialty injectables sales were down 10% for the first quarter. The decline related mainly to 2 factors: First, docetaxel. If you recall, we launched docetaxel in the first quarter of 2011, which made for a difficult year-over-year comparison. Despite the tough comps, docetaxel actually held up extremely well in the quarter. No new competitors entered the market, which enabled us to maintain our market share of close to 50%. Pricing remains fairly rational, declining to approximately 60% off the branded product pricing. The second factor was the impact of supply issues, primarily driven by remediation activities, which affected several of our products, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs. Partially offsetting the decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter.
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Meropenem performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We have launched the product in most major countries in Western Europe and have captured a leading market share position overall in the region. Nivestim, our biosimilar filgrastim, also had a strong quarter in many of our EMEA markets. It has performed particularly well in France, where we recently added additional sales staff to support the product, which we believe is the fastest growing biosimilar filgrastim in that country.
In Asia-Pacific, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 13% in the quarter. While market demand is still strong, we had some difficult year-over-year comparisons due to the timing of wholesale or buying patterns in Australia, our largest country in our Asia-Pacific region. In Japan, net sales trends for Precedex remained strong. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 7% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of strong built-up demand for Plum device sales. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive FDA clearance for our 510(k) application for the upgraded Symbiq software and have begun working with customers to upgrade the installed base of Symbiq devices with the new software. We expect to begin shipments to a select number of new customers later this quarter. We also continued to make progress on our comprehensive device review by conducting additional investigations to drive the root cause and implement appropriate actions.
Sales in our Other Pharma product line were relatively flat in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Strong demand by certain third-party customers was offset by the impact of the quality remediation actions we have been taking at our pharma manufacturing facilities and the resulting delays in product release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,183587742,293735,"Hospira Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales, net sales for t",1061,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike. 
Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales, net sales for the quarter was 37.0%, which was down from 42.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This is primarily due to cost associated with our quality initiatives, including some inventory losses, as well as price declines on 2011 U.S. launches and oncology products in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific.
As expected, R&D expense in the quarter increased 21% to $69 million over last year, primarily as a result of higher clinical trial spending, as well as the initiation of our global expansion program.
R&D as a percentage of net sales was 7.2% of revenue compared to 5.7% for the first quarter of 2011. 
SG&A expense for the first quarter was $184 million, up 12% from $165 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased sales and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses.
As a result, adjusted operating income was $104 million compared to $203 million in the first quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 10.8% compared to 20.3% of net sales in last year's first quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% in the first quarter last year. The reduced tax rate in the 3 months ended March 31 resulted from increased quality and product-related expenses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, combined with a greater mix of operating income in lower or tax-free jurisdictions. 
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.93 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $87 million compared to $6 million for the same period in 2011. The increase this year is a result -- or the increase over last year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital, including inventory, and the timing of receivables collections which more than offset the decline in net income. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $67 million compared to $62 million in the first quarter of last year. And the spending this quarter includes the investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our new pharma plant that is being built in Vizag, India. 
Our cash balance at March 31 was $656 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year and $597 million at March 31 of last year.
Next, turning to our full year guidance. We're maintaining all data points that we provided on our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call in February of this year. We're maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange contributing a negative 1%. Adjusted gross margin projections remain in the range of 35% to 37%, and adjusted operating margins in the range of 12% to 13%. This translates into adjusted EPS guidance of $2 to $2.30 per share.
I'd also like to remind you some of the assumptions we've provided when we delivered our 2012 guidance in February versus where we are today. First, for Rocky Mount. The lower end of our guidance range assumes that Rocky's production -- Rocky Mount's production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. Moving up in the guidance range assumes that the facility remains at 60% to 70% to the first half of the year but that production and the pace of product release accelerates in the second half of the year.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, one of the key factors relative to the guidance range is our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdowns at many of our pharma plants, which occur annually in early July. As we progress with our remediation efforts, we continue to find and respond to issues and, as Mike said, we want to address any and all issues now to get the foundation fully fixed rather than waiting until later. Therefore, when we shut the plants down in the third quarter -- early in the third quarter for preventive maintenance, we may take advantage of these shutdowns as we did in the first quarter by possibly extending them and the downtime work -- and the downtime to work on any additional issues we may uncover.
Next regarding other 483s. Our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483s continue to make progress toward meeting the commitments communicated to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Next related to Symbiq. The midpoint of our guidance range assumed approval -- FDA approval of Symbiq by midyear, with sales beginning in the second half of the year. Relative to the second quarter, while we do anticipate some new sales, we are initially focused on remediating pumps that are already in the field and filling previously signed customer orders, which really won't have a significant impact on our guidance.
And finally with respect to Precedex, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor regarding the 2013 patent. And we're maintaining our guidance assumption that with an extension of the patent for our pediatric studies, we will retain market exclusivity in the U.S. until early 2014.
The remaining assumptions for the full year revenue guidance we outlined on the fourth quarter call remain unchanged.
In terms of calendarization, we expect adjusted gross margin in the second half of the year to be slightly weaker than the first half of the year, again, as the second half will be impacted by our scheduled preventive maintenance shutdowns. For R&D, we expect the full year to remain in the 7.0 to 7.5 percentage of net sales range. But based on the timing of clinical trial spending, R&D absolute dollars should rise in the second and third quarter. SG&A should ramp down approximately 5% to 8% in absolute dollars from the first quarter and then remain fairly flat throughout the year. As a result, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be relatively flat with the first quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final wrap-up comments."

We remain highly focused on our remediation efforts as I am determined that we're going to get this fixed and meet the FDA's expectations. We also have been communicating regularly and working diligently with the FDA and our customers to help manage the industry worldwide drug shortage situation. I'll take this opportunity to say that we greatly appreciate the FDA's cooperation and our customers' patience in this regard. We continue to drive our growth programs and to tap into the many growth opportunities that exist for Hospira.
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we still have a lot of work to do relative to our quality initiatives. We've made a lot of progress. We have a great team in place and remain in control of the process, but there are still a number of unknowns out there. I told you before I liken the process to one of draining the swamp. Sometimes, it means you find gators you didn't know existed. As we travel down the road to recovery, issues are surfacing and we are jumping into action to resolve them. 
I'll reiterate that I am committed to getting our foundation fixed over the short term, and when we do, Hospira will have an even greater competitive position in the industry. That, plus the work we're doing to capitalize on our tremendous growth opportunities, is positioning Hospira for longer-term success as the world-leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies.

What happened with the FDA meeting that was going to happen a few weeks after the last call but that was canceled and not rescheduled? And then what is the actual trigger to make the production levels go from 60% to 70% to something much higher? Is that in inspection you would -- a reinspection you would expect? Or could that occur without a reinspection? Can you just put some color around what drives materially higher production level after the planned shutdown?"

With respect to the timing around the meeting with them, we have been discussing with them for a number of months a meeting. It's simply been a scheduling issue. We feel that we will -- in this quarter or certainly before the next call, we feel we will have an opportunity to get a face-to-face meeting with them. And obviously, then we can give you an update as to what occurs then. So it's simply been a scheduling issue with respect to the FDA. Turning to your second question on what then gets our ramp from 60% to 70% up to something higher. Essentially, I believe, it's uncovering these issues, getting our plants up in terms of first pass quality, getting the tough exception reports that we need to get through our labs behind us and getting to more of a free flow of product. So as we continue to go through our remediation, we are uncovering issues. This causes then a slowdown in our manufacturing or a backup behind our lab as we seek to ensure that the products are safe and effective. Once we get through this particular period, I believe that the plans will, or at least Rocky Mount, will get better than at the release process. We will have less issues as we've taken care of the issues and then we should start to see a ramp-up in terms of supply. I should also say that product supply is somewhat dependent upon the amount of remediation that we have to do. As we find things, a lot of times, we have to divert resources away from the product supply area into looking at detailed remediation on a specific issue, and this causes a slowdown in the system. So again, as we get these remediation efforts behind us, I believe we will see a ramp-up then from the 60% to 70% level."

When all this work is done, how much higher is your cost of manufacturing going to be relative to prior, when this process has started? Since like you're hiring people, you're going to have more manufacturing oversight, you're upgrading suites, it seems like it points to higher marginal cost of production going forward.

Coming into this year and going back as far as almost to the end of 2010, we've added at least 300 basis points of cost to our cost structure. And depending on how you look at it, it could be more than that. And we had been running, I think, if you normalized our margins for oxaliplatin, as well as some of the early quality issues we began to have in 2010, near as I could tell, we were running normally around 41%, 42%. So we've seen at least a 300 basis drop off. I think it's slightly more than that depending on how you look at it. Whatever it is, we're not intending to sort of stop there and have a permanent impact to the cost structure. As Mike said, the key here is getting our first pass quality up so that we're not writing, we call them, exception reports or basically production deviation reports where something isn't right with the production or something's not right with the documentation. I've been through quality training before, and the cost of quality, when you can get the first pass quality, it's a --  I won't say it's exponential, but it's a magnitude in cost savings on what you think you're actually spending. So we've had to add these costs in. Some of them are people. The consultants will go away towards the end of the year or early next year, as Mike said. We're going to get more efficient with the existing people we have. We're adding automation. We will begin to modernize, particularly Rocky Mount, potentially some of these other factories to help gain more efficiencies. But the key is getting the first pass quality, and that's where we intend to drive to get our cost back in line because we can't stand still with the cost structure we have right now. But it's just going to take some time."

And then as we turn to Costa Rica, again, more observations, 2 which were handled right on the spot, 2 which we did not deem to be critical. So as we look at it, we take it as an overall positive.

So this is how we have defined it for our organization. On the first then, what we are trying to do, obviously, is, all these initiatives that we have pointed out around quality, to get the foundation very solid. But what I want to ensure is that when we do have that foundation solid and fixed that there are great growth opportunities out there. So we can't let the whole organization be dragged down, fixing the foundation route. We need to have a lot of the organization focused on the opportunities that are in front of us. So as we've basically divvied up the work, what we've done is added a considerable amount of expertise and talent and people into this, reinforcing the foundation idea. And as you look at the new hires that we have brought in, be it our new Head of Quality, Zena Kaufman, or our new Head of Operations, John Elliot, they bring in heavy experience. And below them, we are also bringing in the talent there. And it's those folks then -- and they are hitting the ground running that we're tasking with this reinforcing the foundation. I should also say that these individuals also have a great deal of credibility with the FDA. So I believe that the agency sees both at that level and levels below them highly credible people, doing those positions and those jobs extremely well. So moving that aside then, we have a number of initiatives then on this turbocharged growth idea, which is essentially our globalization platform. So I talked about in the prepared remarks that we are moving ahead with globalization, and you heard Tom talked about the increase in research development up over 20% over last year. So we are putting funds behind that. We also getting behind our biosimilars program in addition to continuing with, developing our SIP pipeline and our IV clinical integration. So I do believe that the organization has enough bandwidth to achieve these things. So we've got part of the organization dedicated to fixing this foundation, another part dedicated to ensuring that we take opportunity with a great, great potential that we have as a company. We've also said of the 2 then right now, if we have to, let's say, on third quarter, take longer to fix certain issues in Rocky Mount, we will do that. Because at the end of the day, if we've got the solid foundation then, we've got excellent opportunities to move forward. So I think with the new folks coming in on to fix the foundation side or reinforce the foundation, they are excellent. Now as I turn to turbocharged growth, I mentioned Richard Davies, who we hired firm Amgen, who is our Chief Commercial Officer, who is truly a global executive. And so we have him right now out in the international parts of our business. He has not been in the U.S. much. He's basically been out in the international arena, looking at how we grow our business. But we're not waiting. We know that the opportunities there by expanding the number of products we market. So we're working diligently on R&D to do that. So I think we've now brought in great expertise into the organization that is helping us with both things, and we're moving aggressively on those opportunities' front. And that's why we want to continue to investing in this thing because once we do get this supply issue behind us -- and it is not a question of if. It's simply a question of when. It is difficult to say when, but when we do, we will have these opportunities then in front of us that we'll be able to take full advantage of."

Sandoz has remained relatively rational but we're still holding around 50% share, but we do think that our share, over time, will probably slide or decline down to the traditional 25% to 35% and there will be additional pricing declines now.

The shutdowns will naturally bring some of the down automatically but the build right -- the increase in inventory, there's no intentional build there in anticipation of a shutdown. We have plenty of inventory on products where we don't need it. We don't have enough inventory on products where we do need it. So it's getting it back and balanced and then break in the bottlenecks or the log jam in Rocky Mount. And relative to sales, I think we stand by our guidance of down 1 to up 2. And in terms of how that cadences out, you can look at previous years. The fourth quarter is always the strongest for us. Certainly, we have to execute on some product releases, but we're sticking with the guidance. And how that plays out, I think, historically, is probably a good way to look at it."

What I can tell you is we've had no discussions with the agency around a consent decree. And if we had, we would have informed you. So I want to just put that on the table. We do continue a very constructive dialogue with the agency. I'm obviously looking to finalize a time to meet with them on a face-to-face basis to go over our remediation plan. And again, I am hoping that will be in the second quarter or at least before the next call. And as you pointed out, in the meantime, we're doing everything we can. So I think the agency is definitely looking at safety, and we have the interim controls to ensure product safety. We've got these 150 consultants at Rocky Mount looking at -- doing oversight, training, remediation, helping us with supply. I think they also, the agency that is, looks at what are you investing behind this. We're investing a tremendous amount of money behind both human capital, equipment and the facility in order to ensure that we are driving towards sustainable change and to keep in rhythm with that culture change. We also have brand new management. And as I mentioned before, I believe this new management has a tremendous amount of credibility with the FDA. On the remediation front, we continue to progress. So when we do get front of the agency, we will be able to point out to them just how much progress we've made there. And with respect to the number of inspections we've had, I take that as a good sign because we're able to show, I believe, that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned I think that quarter 1, actually, when you look at the number of inspections and, I believe, how well the organization did, given that no 483 is a good one, but given that's an improvement of where we've been in the past, I think this is actually a positive. And I've sent third parties out to make sure that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned before, we've had Lachman out, reviewing our commitments. We've had other third-party consultants reviewing our labs across the U.S. network. We are currently doing our quality units with a third party to ensure that we are living up to our commitments there. And then I think at the end of the day, the agency looks at the CEO to say, ""Is the CEO involved or committed?"" And I can tell you I am committed to this process, and we're doing everything we can to demonstrate that and doing everything we can to communicate that. So on that basis, if we are judged by our actions right now, I feel we are doing everything we can. But at the end of the day, there is no guarantee at all about the consent decree one way or the other."

Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with a discussion on guidance.
As I've said before, reinforcing the foundation is our #1 priority and that has not changed. On the quality front, as we progress with our remediation and move forward towards recovery, we are uprooting and resolving issues, we are preparing and responding to various FDA inspections. And with our strength in leadership, we are working cross-functionally across our plants to share best practices and to put the highest quality processes and procedures in place.
Let's start with Rocky Mount. First, we remain on track with our remediation efforts at the plant. As we indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are currently maintaining our production and release levels in the 60% to 70% range and anticipate that we will remain at these levels through at least midyear.
Second, we are also making progress with our hiring efforts at Rocky. We have placed over 100 full-time employees at the plant since the beginning of the year. This is in addition to the more than 150 consultants we already have working on the plant floor with our employees and assisting us with our remediation efforts. We expect these consultants to remain with us for most of the year, after which we expect to steadily ramp down as our internal staff takes over many of the roles and responsibilities the consultants have been performing for us.
And finally, we have had continued -- we have continued our regular constructive dialogues with the FDA regarding our current progress at Rocky and continue to press forward with implementation of our remediation plan. The agency has told us they are willing to meet with us to discuss our plan, and we are communicating with them to finalize a date.
Moving to our Other Pharma facilities. At our Clayton plant, which is also cited under the Warning Letter with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted an inspection in March. The inspection was not a full cGMP audit but a limited inspection focused on a specific issue. The agency had one observation regarding how we conduct investigations, which we did not deem to be critical in nature. We have already addressed and completed the corrective action for this observation.
In addition, during the month of March, we encountered some manufacturing issues at the plant and elected to shut down production to investigate. This has created a temporary shortage situation with propofol and has also impacted certain contract manufacturing customers. Last week, we completed the corrective action, which we believe addresses the issue. We have restarted production and will begin a staged release of quarantined product in the coming weeks.
At our Austin plant, we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call that we had retained Lachman, a third-party consulting firm, to audit the completion of the plant's corrective actions. They concluded that all of the commitments we made to the agency in our action plan had been fully completed. In March, we received from the FDA what is referred to as an untitled letter. The letter clarified the agency's expectations regarding the scope of some of our corrective actions we took to resolve the observations in the 483 they issued last year. We have responded to the letter with our plan to address their concerns. And with the additional corrective actions in place, we'll be better prepared for their next inspection.
At our Lake Forest facility, the FDA recently performed an inspection of our stability labs and our adverse events reporting process, and concluded the inspection with 0 observations. On the device side of the house, the FDA recently inspected both of our device plants. Our Dominican Republic plant received 0 observations and our Costa Rica plant received 4 observations, none of which we deem critical and 2 of which were addressed prior to the completion of the inspection.
To wrap up our quality discussion, I'll take a minute to welcome John Elliot as our new Senior Vice President of Operations. John is a very seasoned global leader with more than 35 years of manufacturing experience, and he has advised some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. He's a great addition to our strength and quality in operations organization and will bring new insights and leadership to help us reinforce our foundation and drive growth.
I am very excited with the addition of new team members now reporting to me: Richard Davies is our new Chief Commercial Officer; Zena Kaufman is our new head of Quality; and now John Elliot is our new head of Operations.
Before turning to the sales result, I'll briefly mention that we also advanced our growth initiatives during the quarter. We began the registration process for several of the drugs targeted for our global expansion program, in addition to working on several other growth initiatives, including advancing our biosimilar programs. And our partner, Celltrion, delivered a major milestone with the European filing of infliximab in the quarter.
Finally, on another positive note, we were pleased with yesterday's positive outcome regarding Precedex. The judge ruled in our favor on the 2013 enantiomer patent, which provides us exclusivity through the life of the patent. We are currently conducting pediatric trials, which would extend the patent exclusivity by 6 months into early 2014. While we were disappointed with the judge's decision regarding our 2019 ICU sedation patent, we believe in the strength of our patent and will take appropriate legal actions to continue our defense on this patent. 
I'll now turn to our sales results for the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results will be on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
On a constant-currency basis, net sales were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2011. By product line, Global Specialty Injectable net sales decreased 8% for the quarter. 
By region, in the Americas, specialty injectables sales were down 10% for the first quarter. The decline related mainly to 2 factors: First, docetaxel. If you recall, we launched docetaxel in the first quarter of 2011, which made for a difficult year-over-year comparison. Despite the tough comp, docetaxel actually held up extremely well in the quarter. No new competitors entered the market, which enabled us to maintain our market share of close to 50%. Pricing remains fairly rational, declining to approximately 60% off the branded product pricing. The second factor was the impact of supply issues, primarily driven by remediation activities, which affected several of our products, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs. Partially offsetting the decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter.
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Meropenem performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We have launched the product in most major countries in Western Europe and have captured a leading market share position overall in the region. Nivestim, our biosimilar filgrastim, also had a strong quarter in many of our EMEA markets. It has performed particularly well in France, where we recently added additional sales staff to support the product, which we believe is the fastest growing biosimilar filgrastim in that country.
In Asia Pacific, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 13% in the quarter. While market demand is still strong, we had some difficult year-over-year comparisons due to the timing of wholesaler buying patterns in Australia, our largest country in our Asia Pacific region. In Japan, net sales trends for Precedex remained strong. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 7% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of strong built-up demand for Plum device sales. During the quarter, we were very pleased to receive FDA clearance for our 510(k) application for the upgraded Symbiq software and have begun working with customers to upgrade the installed base of Symbiq devices with the new software. We expect to begin shipments to a select number of new customers later this quarter. We also continued to make progress on our comprehensive device review by conducting additional investigations to drive to root cause and implement appropriate actions.
Sales in our Other Pharma product line were relatively flat in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Strong demand by certain third-party customers was offset by the impact of the quality remediation actions we have been taking at our pharma manufacturing facilities and the resulting delays in product release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,183587742,293987,"Hospira Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales, net sales for t",1060,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the income statement then talk a little bit about cash flow and wrap up with guidance and then turn it back over to Mike. 
Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales, net sales for the quarter, was 37.0%, which was down from 42.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This is primarily due to costs associated with our quality initiatives, including some inventory losses, as well as price declines on 2011 U.S. launches and oncology products in the EMEA and Asia Pacific.
As expected, R&D expense in the quarter increased 21% to $69 million over last year, primarily as a result of higher clinical trial spending, as well as the initiation of our global expansion program.
R&D as a percentage of net sales was 7.2% of revenue, compared to 5.7% for the first quarter of 2011. 
SG&A expense for the first quarter was $184 million, up 12% from $165 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased sales and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses.
As a result, adjusted operating income was $104 million compared to $203 million in the first quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 10.8% compared to 20.3% of net sales in last year's first quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% in the first quarter last year. The reduced tax rate in the 3 months ended March 31 resulted from increased quality and product-related expenses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, combined with a greater mix of operating income in lower or tax-free jurisdictions. 
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.93 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $87 million compared to $6 million for the same period in 2011. The increase this year is a result of -- or the increase over last year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital, including inventory, and the timing of receivables collections, which more than offset the decline in net income. 
Capital spending in the quarter was $67 million compared to $62 million in the first quarter of last year. And the spending this quarter includes the investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our new pharma plant that is being built in Vizag, India. 
Our cash balance at March 31 was $656 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year and $597 million at March 31 of last year.
Next, turning to our full year guidance. We're maintaining all data points that we provided on our 2011 fourth quarter earnings call in February of this year. We're maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange contributing a negative 1%. Adjusted gross margin projections remain in the range of 35% to 37%, and adjusted operating margins in the range of 12% to 13%. This translates into adjusted EPS guidance of $2 to $2.30 per share.
I'd also like to remind you of some of the assumptions we provided when we delivered our 2012 guidance in February versus where we are today. First, for Rocky Mount. The lower end of our guidance range assumes that Rocky's production, Rocky Mount's production, remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. Moving up in the guidance range assumes that the facility remains at 60% to 70% through the first half of the year but that production and the pace of product release accelerates in the second half of the year.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, one of the key factors relative to the guidance range is our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdowns at many of our pharma plants, which occur annually in early July. As we progress with our remediation efforts, we continue to find and respond to issues and as Mike said, we want to address any and all issues now, to get the foundation fully fixed rather than waiting until later. Therefore, when we shut the plants down in the third quarter, early in the third quarter, for preventive maintenance, we may take advantage of these shutdowns, as we did in the first quarter by possibly extending them in the downtime work, in the downtime to work on any additional issues we may uncover.
Next, regarding other 483s. Our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483s continue to make progress toward meeting the commitments communicated to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Next, related to Symbiq. The midpoint of our guidance range assumed approval, FDA approval, of Symbiq by midyear, with sales beginning in the second half of the year. Relative to the second quarter, while we do anticipate some new sales, we are initially focused on remediating pumps that are already in the field and filling previously signed customer orders, which really won't have a significant impact on our guidance.
And finally with respect to Precedex, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor regarding the 2013 patent, and we're maintaining our guidance assumption that with an extension of the patent for our pediatric studies, we will retain market exclusivity in the U.S. until early 2014.
The remaining assumptions for the full year revenue guidance we outlined on the fourth quarter call remain unchanged.
In terms of calendarization, we expect adjusted gross margin in the second half of the year to be slightly weaker than the first half of the year, again, as the second half will be impacted by our scheduled preventive maintenance shutdowns. For R&D, we expect the full year to remain in the 7.0 to 7.5 percentage of net sales range. But based on the timing of clinical trial spending, R&D absolute dollars should rise in the second and third quarter. SG&A should ramp down approximately 5% to 8% in absolute dollars from the first quarter and then remain fairly flat throughout the year. As a result, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be relatively flat with the first quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final wrap-up comments."

We remain highly focused on our remediation efforts as I am determined that we are going to get this fixed and meet the FDA's expectations. We also have been communicating regularly and working diligently with the FDA and our customers to help manage the industry-wide drug shortage situation. I'll take this opportunity to say that we greatly appreciate the FDA's cooperation and our customers' patience in this regard. We continue to drive our growth programs and to tap into the many growth opportunities that exist for Hospira.
Looking forward for the rest of the year, we still have a lot of work to do relative to our quality initiatives. We've made a lot of progress. We have a great team in place and remain in control of the process, but there are still a number of unknowns out there. I told you before, I liken the process to one of draining the swamp. Which sometimes means you find gators you didn't know existed. As we travel down the road to recovery, issues are surfacing and we are jumping into action to resolve them. 
I'll reiterate that I am committed to getting our foundation fixed over the short term, and when we do, Hospira will have an even greater competitive position in the industry. That, plus the work we're doing to capitalize on our tremendous growth opportunities, is positioning Hospira for longer-term success as the world's leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies. It's an exciting and challenging journey and one I'm very excited to be leading.
With that, operator, we are ready for questions."

With respect to the timing around the meeting with them, we have been discussing with them, for a number of months, a meeting. It's simply been a scheduling issue. We feel that we will, in this quarter or certainly before the next call, we feel we will have an opportunity to get a face-to-face meeting with them. And obviously, then we can give you an update as to what occurs then. So it's simply been a scheduling issue with respect to the FDA. Turning to your second question on what then gets our ramp from 60% to 70% up to something higher. Essentially, I believe, it's uncovering these issues, getting our plants up in terms of first pass quality, getting the tough exception reports that we need to get through our labs behind us and getting to more of a free flow of product. So as we continue to go through our remediation, we are uncovering issues. This causes then a slowdown in our manufacturing or a backup behind our lab as we seek to ensure that the products are safe and effective. Once we get through this particular period, I believe that the plans will, or at least Rocky Mount, will get better than at the release process. We will have less issues as we've taken care of the issues and then we should start to see a ramp-up in terms of supply. I should also say that product supply is somewhat dependent upon the amount of remediation that we have to do. As we find things, a lot of times, we have to divert resources away from the product supply area into looking at detailed remediation on a specific issue, and this causes a slowdown in the system. So again, as we get these remediation efforts behind us, I believe we will see a ramp-up then from the 60% to 70% level."

Coming into this year and going back as far as almost to the end of 2010, we've added at least 300 basis points of cost to our cost structure. And depending on how you look at it, it could be more than that. And we had been running, I think, if you normalized our margins for oxaliplatin, as well as some of the early quality issues we began to have in 2010, near as I could tell, we were running normally around 41%, 42%. So we've seen at least a 300 basis [indiscernible] drop off. I think it's slightly more than that depending on how you look at it. Whatever it is, we're not intending to sort of stop there and have a permanent impact to the cost structure. As Mike said, the key here is getting our first pass quality up so that we're not writing, we call them, exception reports or basically production deviation reports where something isn't right with the production or something's not right with the documentation. I've been through quality training before, and the cost of quality, when you can get to first pass quality, it's a -- I won't say it's exponential, but it's a magnitude in cost savings on what you think you're actually spending. So we've had to add these costs in. Some of them are people. The consultants will go away towards the end of the year or early next year, as Mike said. We're going to get more efficient with the existing people we have. We're adding automation. We will begin to modernize, particularly Rocky Mount, potentially some of these other factories, to help gain more efficiencies. But the key is getting to first pass quality, and that's where we intend to drive to get our cost back in line because we can't stand still with the cost structure we have right now. But it's just going to take some time."

We don't see anything in Rocky right at this moment, which would say, ""Gee, we're going to have to have an extended shutdown."" What we're referring to in that third quarter shutdown is that it does represent an opportunity which we will take if we see an advantage to it to get some major thing fixed or something that is easier to get fixed during a shutdown. So that was the purpose behind our statement. So nothing I see right now. But if the opportunity presents itself, we will not hesitate to move forward and get this thing fixed even if it impacts our ability to, on service levels."

You can go back and look at the historical information in that regard. And then on pricing, I'll let Mike kind of talk to that.

So this is how we have defined it for our organization. On the first then, what we are trying to do, obviously, is, all these initiatives that we have pointed out around quality, to get the foundation very solid. But what I want to ensure is that when we do have that foundation solid and fixed that there are great growth opportunities out there. So we can't let the whole organization be dragged down, fixing the foundation route. We need to have a lot of the organization focused on the opportunities that are in front of us. So as we've basically divvied up the work, what we've done is added a considerable amount of expertise and talent and people into this, reinforcing the foundation idea. And as you look at the new hires that we have brought in, be it our new head of Quality, Zena Kaufman, or our new head of Operations, John Elliot, they bring in heavy experience. And below them, we are also bringing in the talent there. And it's those folks then -- and they are hitting the ground running -- that we're tasking with this reinforcing the foundation. I should also say that these individuals also have a great deal of credibility with the FDA. So I believe that the agency sees, both at that level and levels below them, highly credible people doing those positions and those jobs extremely well. So moving that aside then, we have a number of initiatives then on this turbocharged growth idea, which is essentially our globalization platform. So I talked about it in the prepared remarks, that we are moving ahead with globalization, and you heard Tom talk about the increase in research and development up over 20% over last year. So we are putting funds behind that. We also getting behind our biosimilars program, in addition to continuing with, developing our SIP pipeline and our IV clinical integration. So I do believe that the organization has enough bandwidth to achieve these things. So we've got part of the organization dedicated to fixing this foundation, another part dedicated to ensuring that we take opportunity with a great, great potential that we have as a company. But I've also said, of the 2 then right now, if we have to, let's say, on the third quarter, take longer to fix certain issues at Rocky Mount, we will do that. Because at the end of the day, if we've got this solid foundation then, we've got excellent opportunities to move forward. So I think with the new folks coming in on the fix the foundation side or reinforce the foundation, they are excellent. Now as I turn to turbocharged growth, I mentioned Richard Davies, who we hired from Amgen, who is our Chief Commercial Officer, who is truly a global executive. And so we have him right now out in the international parts of our business. He has not been in the U.S. much. He's basically been out in the international arena, looking at how we grow our business. But we're not waiting. We know that the opportunity is there by expanding the number of products we market. So we're working diligently in R&D to do that. So I think we've now brought in great expertise into the organization that is helping us with both things, and we're moving aggressively on those opportunities' fronts. And that's why we want to continue to investing in this thing because once we do get this supply issue behind us -- and it is not a question of if, it's simply a question of when. It is difficult to say when, but when we do, we will have these opportunities then in front of us that we'll be able to take full advantage of."

We have plenty of inventory on products where we don't need it. We don't have enough inventory on products where we do need it. So it's getting it back in balance and then breaking the bottlenecks or the log jam in Rocky Mount. And relative to sales, I think we stand by our guidance of down 1% to up 2%.

I think just to be absolutely clear, we cannot predict what is going to happen with respect to any consent decree, whether it will or will not happen. So I want to be clear on that point. What I can tell you is we've had no discussions with the agency around a consent decree. And if we had, we would have informed you. So I want to just put that on the table. We do continue a very constructive dialogue with the agency. I'm obviously looking to finalize a time to meet with them on a face-to-face basis to go over our remediation plan. And again, I am hoping that will be in the second quarter or at least before the next call. And as you pointed out, in the meantime, we're doing everything we can. So I think the agency is definitely looking at safety, and we have the interim controls to ensure product safety. We've got those 150 consultants at Rocky Mount looking at -- doing oversight, training, remediation, helping us with supply. I think they also, the agency that is, looks at what are you investing behind this. We're investing a tremendous amount of money behind both human capital, equipment and the facility in order to ensure that we are driving towards sustainable change and to keep in rhythm with that culture change. We also have brand new management. And as I mentioned before, I believe this new management has a tremendous amount of credibility with the FDA. On the remediation front, we continue to progress. So when we do get in front of the agency, we will be able to point out to them just how much progress we've made there. And with respect to the number of inspections we've had, I take that as a good sign, because we're able to show, I believe, that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned, I think that quarter 1, actually, when you look at the number of inspections and, I believe, how well the organization did, given that no 483 is a good one, but given that's an improvement of where we've been in the past, I think this is actually a positive. And I've sent third parties out to make sure that we are living up to our commitments. So as I mentioned before, we've had Lachman out reviewing our commitments. We've had other third-party consultants reviewing our labs across the U.S. network. We are currently doing our quality units with a third party to ensure that we are living up to our commitments there. And then I think at the end of the day, the agency looks at the CEO to say, ""Is the CEO involved or committed?"" And I can tell you I am committed to this process, and we're doing everything we can to demonstrate that and doing everything we can to communicate that. So on that basis, if we are judged by our actions right now, I feel we are doing everything we can. But at the end of the day, there is no guarantee at all about a consent decree one way or the other."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2012 conference call. I will begin today's call by providing an update on our quality remediation efforts and growth initiatives followed by a discussion of our second quarter sales results which, like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations and those of the street. Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with a discussion on guidance. 
In line with the approach we have adopted since the acceleration of our remediation activities last year, we're providing as much disclosure as we can under the circumstances, including a list of FDA inspections since our last quarter call. We continue to progress with our remediation and move towards recovery, making for a very busy quarter. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the FDA, meeting with them on several locations both at the agency's headquarters and the district offices. We had several FDA inspections, both at our plants and at our corporate headquarters. Third, we continue to progress with our remediation efforts at Rocky Mount. Our annual preventive maintenance shutdown went as planned we are bringing the lines back into production. Fourth, we are sharing our learnings at Rocky and other facilities across the organization to ensure implementation of best practices and to holistically put in place modern and robust quality processes and systems. 
As our remediation program progresses across our plants, we have uprooted additional issues, some of which have unfortunately resulted in product recalls, inventory loss and production disruptions. We are driving to root cause and implementing corrective actions. As we have said in the past, we believe identifying and resolving these issues signify that we are moving in the right direction on our journey to achieving sustainable compliance. 
Let me provide additional details on some of these activities starting with Rocky Mount. First of all, as I mentioned, we've made significant progress with our remediation efforts at the plant. We went into our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdown in early July. 10 days later, we start the plant backup in a phased approach and are returning to the 60% to 70% production and release levels. We expect to remain at this level during the third quarter and then modestly increase through the end of the year. During the maintenance shutdown, we took advantage of the downtime to advance our modernization at the plant including completing various facility upgrades and commencing activity to fully automate our visual inspection process. Over time, these efforts will lead to greater efficiency at Rocky and ultimately faster release rates and improved supply levels. Second, our intent is to begin ramping down the level of consultants at Rocky. We are building up a robust number of trained internal employees to do the work on the plant floor and by year end we expect the number of consultants to gradually decline as their role becomes limited to overseeing remediation activities. We are pleased by the progress at the facility and I want to thank all of those at Rocky Mount for their tremendous work and effort. And third, and I know many of you are looking forward to at update on our interactions with the FDA, we have continued to have constructive and productive dialogue with the agency including 2 meetings on Rocky Mount during which we discussed our comprehensive action plan and our progress to date. One of the meetings was at the FDA's headquarters, or the center, and included representatives from districts, as well as the office of compliance and the Office of Drug Shortage. While final minutes of the meeting are circulating at the agency per comment, we believe the FDA has accepted the work plan that we previously submitted. The agency acknowledged that we were moving in the right direction with the right level of commitment, but indicated they needed to see continued progress. We realized that much work remains to be done but left the meeting encouraged. 
As part of our continuing global quality efforts, we are reviewing our quality systems across all of our plants. Where there are gaps, we are bringing in third-party support in an interim basis as we improve the system. We've already started implementing this at Austin and Boulder and will be looking at the other plants as we proceed through our assessments. The oversight is on a much smaller scale than what we have in Rocky Mount and commensurate with that assessment outcome required activities. For example, at Austin we brought in a handful of consultants to assist in our quality improvement efforts. 
As far as recent inspections, at our Clayton plant, which was originally cited under the 2010 warning letter along with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted a full cGMP inspection which resulted in 6 noncritical observations regarding stability studies, sampling documentation and methodology and equipment validations. It is important to note that investigators did not cite any of the observations as repeat observations and in fact, each of the 3 investigators made positive comments regarding the progress we have made at Clayton as part of our quality journey. In addition, as discussed during our first quarter earnings call in May, we previously experienced some manufacturing issues at the plant related to the water for injector system and the observance of particulate in final product in test batches. As a result, we did not release any significant amount of product during the quarter at Clayton. This has resulted in a shortage situation with propofol as well as impacting supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. We believe we have addressed the root cause of the issues and have taken appropriate steps to correct these issues, but need to demonstrate the effectiveness of our corrective actions. If all goes according to plan, we should be back up in manufacturing sometime in the third quarter and releasing product in the fourth quarter. 
At our Boulder plant, the FDA performed an inspection and the facility and issued 7 observations. Boulder is a small on oncolytic API plant and the observation centered around cleaning validation, process validation and laboratory investigations. We have responded the FDA with our plan to address the observations and in a subsequent meeting, the agency did not object to the scope of our plan corrections. 
At McPherson, the FDA came back to the plant for a focused inspection on the issue related to overfilled Carpuject vials we experienced earlier this quarter and no observations were issued. 
At ZHOPL, which is our joint-venture facility in India, the site had its first full cGMP inspection since its initial inspection and no observations were issued. 
At Austin, just this Monday, the FDA began both a follow-up inspection and a general cGMP inspection of this site. 
We recognize that we are receiving heightened scrutiny from the FDA as the agency is interested in monitoring our progress and ensuring compliance across our manufacturing facilities. We support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our manufacturing footprint. 
Finally, on the device side of the house. We continue to make progress on our comprehensive device review and are advancing our efforts in this regard. Although d most of the investigations are targeted to be completed towards the end of the year and end of 2013, a few corrective actions including field recalls have already been initiated. Also the FDA recently inspected the device design controls and complaint system at our Lake Forest facility and issued a 483 with 10 observations. The observations principally related to complaint handling and documentations, supplier quality and regulatory labeling. We are working on a response to the agency which is due in early August. 
So as you can see, we had a very busy see quarter and continue to move forward with both our pharma and device remediation efforts. I realized that some of your concerned about the length of time this is taking and that additional issues keep bubbling up. However, from my perspective, we are making progress and we are seeing encouraging signs of improvement. At Rocky Mount, many of our metrics are now moving in the right direction such as first pass quality and production scheduling adherence, which are leading indicators of the health of our plant. Across our facilities with the vigilance of our strong the operations and policy leadership, we are closing out investigations faster using a more effective and vigorous process to drive to resolution. Using the swamp analogy I've referenced over the past several quarters, we are draining the swamp and dealing with the gators we have uncovered. As I've reiterated numerous times, I am committed to resolving our quality issue and getting as much done in 2012 as possible. I believe the FDA understands, and I know that our employees do as well, my commitment in this respect. But it is not a quick fix. It's complex, it takes time and money and there may be additional gators yet to be uncovered along the way. That said, I know we'll get through this, it's a matter of when, not it. And when we do we'll be in a much stronger competitive position. 
We also remain focused on our growth initiatives and we are moving forward with our growth expansion plans and the related regulatory filings. During the second half of the year, we expect to make significant progress with the goal of finding approximately 50 new to country submissions by the end of the year. This is in line with our original timeline and we expect to start seeing commercial gains in the 2014, 2015 timeframe. 
In addition, we were pleased to have recently transitioned China from a third-party distribution model to a direct commercial presence. We currently have a staff of approximately 60 employees there who celebrated the first sales to hospitals under our new direct model in China. 
Our overarching goal is to grow profitably, which admittedly is challenging during the remediation process. However, we believe that as we reduce complexity in our plants as part of the remediation process, we will realize additional optimization as a natural outcome of the process. We're also continuing to drive product rationalization and towards this objective, we initiated plans in June do exit next over the not course of the next 6 months. Furthermore we continue to aggressively pursue price increases for products across our regions. 
On the growth side, our relationship with Celltrion is starting to bear fruit. During the quarter we've filed our biosimilar dossier with the European Health Authority for infliximab, a biologic that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other indications, which we will market under the brand name Inflectra. The dossier is currently under review and we have been in active communication with the health authority. We plan to apply the experience we gaining with our current 2 biosimilars to commercializing Inflectra at market formation. 
In addition, this month we will be relaunching oxaliplatin, an oncology drug. You will recall we are the first to launch oxaliplatin in 2009 after successfully charging the originator's patent. Finally, before moving to the sales discussion, I'd like to highlight 2 recent additions to Hospira. We were very pleased to announce yesterday that Dennis joined our Board of Directors. Dennis' unparalleled experience with biologics manufacturing and operations quality make him an excellent fit for the board and we look forward to working with him and join the benefits of his contribution. We also welcome Neil Widing during the quarter to the newly established role of Senior Vice President, Devices. Neil, with his excessive device product background will bring significant progress and experience to this billion dollar business. 
Turning out our sales results for the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results are on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
Net sales were relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2011. Strong volumes on in certain specialty injectable products outside the U.S. and higher device sales were offset by a difficult comparison to second quarter 2011 performance which saw strong U.S. sales from launch of docetaxel, as well as a positive contribution from several other launch compounds. By product line, global specialty injectable net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Very strong SIP performance in EMEA and APAC were not enough to offset softer results in the Americas. Let me now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable sales were down 6% for the second quarter. The decline related to several factors: First, docetaxel. Docetaxel continued to perform well in the quarter. Market share remains at almost 50% with pricing still at approximately 60% off the branded product pricing, higher than expected levels. However, the second quarter of 2011 was the first full quarter post-launch for docetaxel, which creates the difficult year-over-year comparison. Second, propofol. As I mentioned earlier, due to manufacturing issues at Clayton, we released very little propofol. What we did release was from inventory manufactured in 2011. Third, we saw year-over-year price declines on some of the products we launched in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011, such as gemcitabine due to competitive market conditions. And fourth, with the impact of supply issues primarily driven by remediation activities which affected several of our products including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs. Partially offsetting decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 20% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were Meropenem, which continued to performed exceptionally well, and Nivestim, our biosimilar filgrastim product. The additional sale staff we added has been beneficial in increasing adoption of Nivestim across Europe. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables increased 5% in the quarter primarily driven by initial stocking from our entry into China and continued cost of performance of Precedex in both Japan and Korea. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 6% during the second quarter, we have seen increased momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps and IV clinical integration systems. Sales in our Other Pharma product line were down 4% in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to softness in solutions as a result of supply constraints. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,212673049,336327,"Hospira Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Mike has taken you through the sales and I'll run you through the rest of the income statement, cash flow and talk a little bit about guidance. First, adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales in the quarter was 36%",781,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Mike has taken you through the sales and I'll run you through the rest of the income statement, cash flow and talk a little bit about guidance. First, adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales in the quarter was 36%, which was down from the 41% in the second quarter of 2011. This is due primarily to cost associated with strengthening our quality systems, lower manufacturing volumes, inventory losses particularly in Clayton, as well as price declines on some of our 2010 and 2011 product launches that Mike mentioned before. 
Moving to R&D expense, it was up 27% in the second quarter to $84 million. This primarily as a result of higher biosimilar clinical trial spending, as well as the continuation of our global expansion program. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 8% compared to 6% in the second quarter of last year. SG&A expense for the second quarter was $170 million, up 9% from $156 million from the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses. 
Adjusted operating income was $117 million compared to $212 million in the second quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 20% in last year's second quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of last year. Reduced rate results from increased expenses and higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as a greater mix of operating income and lower tax or tax-free jurisdictions. 
And finally, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.94 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, was $216 million compared to $253 million for the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects lower income from operations in 2012, which was partially offset by working capital improvements driven by lower inventory level as we continue to work out our inventories. Capital spending for the first 6 months of this year was $137 million, relatively flat with last year. The largest portion of the capital spend this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our greenfield pharma plants we're building in Vizag, India. 
Our cash balance at June 30, was $720 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Moving next to guidance for the full year. We're maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis. However, the impact of foreign exchange is becoming more of a headwind, and is now expected to contribute between negative 1% to negative 2% decrease in sales. We're maintaining our gross margin range of 35% to 37%, but we do anticipate we'll be at the low end of that range primarily as a result of a couple of items. First, greater than anticipated freight and distribution as we work diligently to deliver available product supply to our customers in a timely manner. And second, potential inventory losses and personnel expenses as we review our quality systems across of all of our plants and assess outcome in required activities. 
For R&D, we're maintaining guidance in the 7% to 7.5% of sales range, but we anticipate that with the spending so far to date, we'll end up more towards the upper end of that range. We do expect SG&A to come down sequentially from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of all those items. We expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 10% to 11%. 
For adjusted EPS, we believe we'll be at the low end of our original guidance range at approximately $2 per share. 
Regarding on our previous remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million, which includes remediation activities for both pharma and devices While we've spent $235 million to date, our current estimates indicate we'll come in toward the upper end of the range and we'll continue to carefully monitor these expenditures. We're decreasing our cash flow from operations guidance to a range of $475 million to $525 million primarily as a result of lower operating income both on a GAAP and an adjusted basis. In terms of calendarization, we expect to be down on both a sales and earnings per share basis sequentially from the second to third quarter, and then up again from the third to the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest sales quarter of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

We made good progress at Rocky Mount with our remediation activities. We continued our constructive dialogue with the FDA and I was pleased with the outcome our meetings with the agency. I believe they understand that we are committed to resolving the issues under the Warning Letter and I believe too that they understand that we are committed to applying what we've learned at Rocky on a holistic basis to reinforce our entire foundation. And toward that end, we've undertaken activities at several of our other facilities which have served for some additional issues, a few more gators on the swamp so to speak, that we are addressing. This has unfortunately created some product shortage situation and required additional effort, cost and time on our part. But while our overall quality initiatives are proving more expensive than we originally thought and may take more time to complete, it's the right thing to do for Hospira and for our customers and the patients they serve. We remain committed to driving as much improvement as possible this year, while at the same time prioritize the needs of our customers the best of our ability given the challenges which we are dealing. We look forward to reaching the other side of our quality remediation so we can resume the steady supply of products our customers and patients rely on and ultimately enjoy the benefits from our global expansion program and our investment in biosimilars. We are absolutely confident that once we get through this, we'll be even stronger than before. And with that, operator, we are ready for questions."

And the end of the session with the investigators, as I mentioned previously, was we had made good progress. We seem we're living up to our commitments, but there's additional work to do. And so with respect to our plants, I would say that that's where I see them right now. Good progress being made. We're living up to our commitments, but there's still a lot of work to be done. With respect to the issues surfacing, you're correct in terms of there are more issues than we had previously thought. So as we are knocking out issues, more issues keep surfacing. But remember, this is deliberate. We are trying to drive, to the surface, all the issues we can in 2012 and take care of them. So the additional issues that you see surfacing which often you see in terms of recalls is really a sign of progress. It's not a sign of deterioration or going backwards. So with our new team onboard, what I've asked them to do is just drive into the issues, find them, uproot them, drive to root cause and get them solved. And so I think in that way, I feel very good about the progress. So far from being discouraged about the issues that are surfacing, I'm encouraged that we're getting them out in the open and we're able to deal with them. And that is a very important thing because they concern before might have been that these issues were not manageable. All of the issues that we've seen surface have been manageable. So again, manageable issues."

I'd say improving the output just by itself is probably going to be a little bit more evident on the sales line than it would be on the margin line. There'll be some minor impact, but the way the overhead structure's put together in Rocky Mount moving from, say, 65% up to 75%, up to 85%, there is some leverage we get on the overhead, but it's not a great deal. So I think over the longer term, if we can get the production up, keep the lab in sync with the quality coming off the line, we should have some opportunity to begin to fix some of the people out of the operation. But in the near term, I wouldn't expect a lot of leverage from that. It's maybe more of the sales opportunity as we work backorders down and get back into a better supply position."

What we said at the start of the year was we had a wide range from to 2 to 2 30 as a EPS number depending on which scenario held true. Scenario one as you recall, was essentially that Rocky continued at that 60 to 70 rate through the year and that directed us to the lower end of the range. The other scenario had us having an inflection point midway through the year and this would then take us towards the midpoint of the guidance. So what we've seen with Rocky then is a lot of issues, manageable issues but it is taking time to get through them. And remediation does affect supply. So as we've got resources on the remediation, it does not allow us to fully get supply out. What we're anticipating is we keep going at that rate in the third quarter and then what we've said very deliberately in the script is a gradual increase in the fourth quarter. So what I'm expecting right now then as we get through the third quarter is that we will be managing the supply up as remediation goes. Now we have a couple of other things that we did not envision when we put up our original guidance and you referred to one of them, which was Claydon. So as I look at Claydon then. We have been through this with a fine-tooth comb in terms of what the root cause is of this particular matter and our water for injection issues. We believe we have identified root cause but right now in the full transparency, we are working through to make sure that the fix we have against that root cause is working. The expectations from experts both inside the company and outside the company are that these fixes will work and that's what gives us some comfort to say we should begin manufacturing some time late into the third quarter, but propofol release will not be until the fourth quarter. Of course, on the next quarter call, we'll be able to tell you whether or not that was successful but at this point, we think there's a better chance to not, that this plant gets back up and running again. With respect to our other plants. So as you look at the first in them, recall that we have a full cGMP there at the end of last year. We've got 6 noncritical observations. The agency then came back in, as I referred to, did a 4 cause inspection and our and issued no observations. So what that told us is that we have very manageable situation within the McPherson plant. As it pertains to Austin, as we reviewed Austin, we felt that it was appropriate to bring in the same oversight people quintiles into Austin in order to ensure that all of the learnings we had at Rocky are actually in place in Austin. And so we are in that process right now. And as I mentioned, the FDA just came in the door at pretty much the same time. So we will get a read from the FDA as to how we're doing in our Rocky -- in our Austin plant, pardon me, as we move forward here. I will say we did have a meeting with the Dallas District that I also attended to talk about the Austin facility. And again, pretty much the same reactions we've had in the other meetings which was, based on what we've said, it looks like good progress being made, but more needs to be done. And that's exactly the basis from which I state that I believe we're making good progress, but definitely more needs to be done. In terms of moving forward then, so what do we see in the next kind of guidepost here. I really look at it as being Rocky Mount inspection. We're anticipating that it should happen either later this year or early next year. And from my standpoint then, that will be an excellent view as to how exactly we're doing and are we turning the corner on our remediation efforts at Rocky. So my net-net here is the issues in the other plants are not to the same extent as Rocky. Rocky is simply a much bigger place. And I feel that we are getting our arms around it. We've identified the issues and we're taking the appropriate action."

Sometimes it takes anywhere from 10 to 12 months in the fastest-moving countries and sometimes as you know in the U.S., it's sitting at 30 to 36 months. So it will be somewhere that range depending on approvals. So that's how we want to get in these markets for submissions as fast as possible accelerate our approval process with the health authorities, as part of this process. So can't tell you per molecule excited when and where, but this process is moving very fast in the company and as Mike as alluded to, the investment in this area they're starting to bear fruit in terms of submissions. for, Herceptin as you mentioned, we are actually in this particular molecule in collaboration with Celltrion.

I mean, obviously, we've uncovered more issues. But as I said, the good news are that the issues are manageable and we're surfacing now. I believe we've done a nice job working constructively with the FDA and they've done a nice job with us in terms of moving the whole remediation plan forward. And as I said in our meeting with them at the center, they were pleased with our progress, pleased with our commitment to it and pleased with investment we're putting behind it and also, I think from a commitment standpoint, pleased that we weren't just going to the letter of the commitments but we were going to the spirit of the commitments to get things done. So as I look at the number of inspections we've had recently, they are verifying that we are where we said we were, which is making progress, but a ways to go. And so in in terms of the Austin facility, obviously you'd like more time but they should go in there, they should see progress that we are making and if we get the same result that we got in Clayton, I'll be satisfied. So we move through the year, I am looking at our global expansion, it really is getting late, as Sumant said, 50 new to country submissions are going in the back half of the year and we've got a ton more going in next year. Our biosimilars program is progressing. We've got IPO in the clinical trials. We have a pass forward on biosimilars, we have infliximab submitted in Europe, so things are moving forward from that respect. As I look at Vizag, it's coming into view about in 2014 and that plant construction continues to go well. As I look at our new team, and we brought in just in the last few months, a new team of Chief Medical Officer, new Head of Regulatory, Head of Quality, Head of U.S. Ops, Head of Operations, Head of Devices, so I think we've transformed the team here into a team that can really move this company forward. So a very important point for us then, and to answer your question on Rocky Mount, how will be do we'll get there, it's essentially with the FDA inspection which I said I would anticipate at the end of the year, beginning of the year. And if we passed that test, that I think we can say we have satisfied the FDA and then we used baseball parlance were tagging third and heading for home on reinforcing the foundation with our growth drivers as a company intact and having the opportunity to get supply going. Having said all that, we still have a lot to do in terms of the remediation work and these expenses are more than we had originally anticipated. So as we work through the year, we can give you more color towards the end."

Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with a discussion on guidance. 
In line with the approach we have adopted since the acceleration of our remediation activities last year, we're providing as much disclosure as we can under the circumstances, including a list of FDA inspections since our last quarter call. We continue to progress with our remediation and move towards recovery, making for a very busy quarter. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the FDA, meeting with them on several locations both at the agency's headquarters and the district offices. We had several FDA inspections both at our plants and at our corporate headquarters. Third, we continue to progress with our remediation efforts at Rocky Mount. Our annual preventive maintenance shutdown went as planned, and we are bringing the lines back into production. Fourth, we are sharing our learnings at Rocky and other facilities across the organization to ensure implementation of best practices and to holistically put in place modern and robust quality processes and systems. 
As our remediation program progresses across our plants, we have uprooted additional issues, some of which have unfortunately resulted in product recalls, inventory loss and production disruptions. We are driving to root cause and implementing corrective actions. As we have said in the past, we believe identifying and resolving these issues signify that we are moving in the right direction on our journey to achieving sustainable compliance. 
Let me provide additional details on some of these activities, starting with Rocky Mount. First of all, as I mentioned, we've made significant progress with our remediation efforts at the plant. We went into our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdown in early July. 10 days later, we started the plant back up in a phased approach and are returning to the 60% to 70% production and release levels. We expect to remain at this level during the third quarter and then modestly increase through the end of the year. During the maintenance shutdown, we took advantage of the downtime to advance our modernization at the plant, including completing various facility upgrades and commencing activity to fully automate our visual inspection process. Over time, these efforts will lead to greater efficiency at Rocky and ultimately faster release rates and improved supply levels. 
Second, our intent is to begin ramping down the level of consultants at Rocky. We are building up a robust number of trained internal employees to do the work on the plant floor, and by year end, we expect the number of consultants to gradually decline as their role becomes limited to overseeing remediation activities. We are pleased by the progress at the facility, and I want to thank all of those at Rocky Mount for their tremendous work and effort. 
And third, and I know many of you are looking forward to an update on our interactions with the FDA, we have continued to have constructive and productive dialogue with the agency, including 2 meetings on Rocky Mount, during which we discussed our comprehensive action plan and our progress to date. One of the meetings was at the FDA's headquarters, or the center, and included representatives from districts, as well as the Office of Compliance and the Office of Drug Shortage. While final minutes of the meeting are circulating at the agency for comments, we believe the FDA has accepted the work plan that we previously submitted. The agency acknowledged that we were moving in the right direction with the right level of commitment but indicated they needed to see continued progress. We realized that much work remains to be done but left the meeting encouraged. 
As part of our continuing global quality efforts, we are reviewing our quality systems across all of our plants. Where there are gaps, we are bringing in third-party support on an interim basis as we improve the system. We've already started implementing this at Austin and Boulder, and we'll be looking at the other plants as we proceed through our assessments. The oversight is on a much smaller scale than what we have at Rocky Mount and commensurate with the assessment outcome and required activities. For example, at Austin, we brought in a handful of consultants to assist in our quality improvement efforts. 
As far as recent inspections, at our Clayton plant, which was originally cited under the 2010 warning letter along with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted a full cGMP inspection, which resulted in 6 noncritical observations regarding stability studies, sampling documentation and methodology and equipment validations. It is important to note that investigators did not cite any of the observations as repeat observations, and in fact, each of the 3 investigators made positive comments regarding the progress we have made at Clayton as part of our quality journey. In addition, as discussed during our first quarter earnings call in May, we previously experienced some manufacturing issues at the plant related to the water for injection system and the observance of particulate in final product in test batches. As a result, we did not release any significant amount of product during the quarter at Clayton. This has resulted in a shortage situation with propofol, as well as impacting supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. We believe we have addressed the root cause of the issues and have taken appropriate steps to correct these issues but need to demonstrate the effectiveness of our corrective actions. If all goes according to plan, we should be back up and manufacturing some time in the third quarter and releasing product in the fourth quarter. 
At our Boulder plant, the FDA performed an inspection at the facility and issued 7 observations. Boulder is a small oncolytic API plant, and the observation centered around cleaning validation, process validation and laboratory investigations. We have responded the FDA with our plan to address the observations, and in a subsequent meeting, the agency did not object to the scope of our planned corrections. 
At McPherson, the FDA came back to the plant for a focused inspection on the issue related to overfilled Carpuject vials we experienced earlier this quarter, and no observations were issued. 
At ZHOPL, which is our joint-venture facility in India, the site had its first full cGMP inspection since its initial inspection, and no observations were issued. 
At Austin, just this Monday, the FDA began both a follow-up inspection and a general cGMP inspection of this site. 
We recognize that we are receiving heightened scrutiny from the FDA as the agency is interested in monitoring our progress and ensuring compliance across our manufacturing facilities. We support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our manufacturing footprint. 
Finally, on the device side of the house. We continue to make progress on our comprehensive device review and are advancing our efforts in this regard. Although most of the investigations are targeted to be completed towards the end of the year and end of 2013, a few corrective actions, including field recalls, have already been initiated. Also, the FDA recently inspected the device design controls and complaint system at our Lake Forest facility and issued a 483 with 10 observations. The observations principally related to complaint handling and documentation, supplier quality and regulatory labeling. We are working on a response to the agency, which is due in early August. 
So as you can see, we had a very busy quarter and continue to move forward with both our pharma and device remediation efforts. I realize that some of you are concerned about the length of time this is taking and that additional issues keep bubbling up. However, from my perspective, we are making progress, and we are seeing encouraging signs of improvement. At Rocky Mount, many of our metrics are now moving in the right direction, such as first pass quality and production schedule adherence, which are leading indicators of the health of our plant. Across our facilities, with the vigilance of our strong new operations and quality leadership, we are closing out investigations faster, using a more effective and vigorous process to drive to resolution. Using the swamp analogy I've referenced over the past several quarters, we are draining the swamp and dealing with the gators we have uncovered. As I've reiterated numerous times, I am committed to resolving our quality issue and getting as much done in 2012 as possible. I believe the FDA understands, and I know that our employees do as well, my commitment in this respect. But it is not a quick fix. It's complex. It takes time and money, and there may be additional gators yet to be uncovered along the way. That said, I know we'll get through this. It's a matter of when, not if. And when we do, we'll be in a much stronger competitive position. 
We also remain focused on our growth initiatives, and we are moving forward with our growth expansion plans and the related regulatory filings. During the second half of the year, we expect to make significant progress with the goal of filing approximately 50 new-to-country submissions by the end of the year. This is in line with our original timeline, and we expect to start seeing commercial gains in the 2014, 2015 time frame. 
In addition, we were pleased to have recently transitioned China from a third-party distribution model to a direct commercial presence. We currently have a staff of approximately 60 employees there, who celebrated the first sales to hospitals under our new direct model in China. 
Our overarching goal is to grow profitably, which, admittedly, is challenging during the remediation process. However, we believe that as we reduce complexity at our plants as part of the remediation process, we will realize additional optimization as a natural outcome of the process. We're also continuing to drive product rationalization, and towards this objective, we initiated plans in June to exit a niche solutions product line over the course of the next 6 months. Furthermore, we continue to aggressively pursue price increases for products across our regions. 
On the growth side, our relationship with Celltrion is starting to bear fruit. During the quarter, we filed our biosimilar dossier with the European health authority for infliximab, a biologic that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other indications, which we will market under the brand name INFLECTRA. The dossier is currently under review, and we have been in active communication with the health authority. We plan to apply the experience we gained with our current 2 biosimilars to commercializing INFLECTRA at market formation. 
In addition, this month, we will be relaunching oxaliplatin, an oncology drug. You may recall we were the first to launch oxaliplatin in 2009 after successfully challenging the originator's patent. 
Finally, before moving to the sales discussion, I'd like to highlight 2 recent additions to Hospira. We were very pleased to announce yesterday that Dennis Fenton joined our Board of Directors. Dennis' unparalleled experience with biologics manufacturing and operations quality make him an excellent fit for the board, and we look forward to working with him, enjoying the benefits of his contributions. We also welcomed Neil Ryding during the quarter to the newly established role of Senior Vice President, Devices. Neil, with his extensive device background, will bring significant focus and experience to this billion-dollar business. 
Turning now to our sales results for the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results are on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. Net sales were relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2011. Strong volumes in certain specialty injectable products outside the U.S. and higher device sales were offset by a difficult comparison to second quarter 2011 performance, which saw strong U.S. sales from the launch of docetaxel, as well as a positive contribution from several other launched compounds. 
By product line, global specialty injectable net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Very strong SIP performance in EMEA and APAC were not enough to offset soft results in the Americas. 
Let me now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable sales were down 6% for the second quarter. The decline related to several factors. First, docetaxel. Docetaxel continued to perform well in the quarter. Market share remains at almost 50%, with pricing still at approximately 60% off the branded product pricing, higher than expected levels. However, the second quarter of 2011 was the first full quarter post-launch for docetaxel, which creates the difficult year-over-year comparison. Second, propofol. As I mentioned earlier, due to manufacturing issues at Clayton, we released very little propofol. What we did release was from inventory manufactured in 2011. Third, we saw year-over-year price declines on some of the products we launched in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011, such as gemcitabine, due to competitive market conditions. And fourth was the impact of supply issues primarily driven by remediation activities, which affected several of our products, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs. Partially offsetting decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 20% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were meropenem, which continued to performed exceptionally well, and Nivestim, our biosimilar filgrastim product. The additional sales staff we added has been beneficial in increasing adoption of filgrastim across Europe. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables increased 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by initial stocking from our entry into China and continued positive performance of Precedex in both Japan and Korea. 
Turning now to Medication Management, global net sales increased 6% during the second quarter. We have seen increased momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps and IV clinical integration systems. Sales in our Other Pharma product line were down 4% in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to softness in solutions as a result of supply constraints. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

Mike has taken you through the sales, and I'll run you through the rest of the income statement, cash flow and then talk a little bit about guidance. First, adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales in the quarter was 36%, which was down from the 41% in the second quarter of 2011. This is due primarily to costs associated with strengthening our quality systems, lower manufacturing volumes, inventory losses, particularly in Clayton, as well as price declines on some of our 2010 and 2011 product launches that Mike mentioned before. 
Moving to R&D expense, it was up 27% in the second quarter to $84 million. This primarily is a result of higher biosimilar clinical trial spending, as well as the continuation of our global expansion program. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 8% compared to 6% in the second quarter of last year. SG&A expense for the second quarter was $170 million, up 9% from $156 million from the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses. 
Adjusted operating income was $117 million compared to $212 million in the second quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 20% in last year's second quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of last year. Reduced rate results from increased expenses in higher-tax rate jurisdictions, as well as a greater mix of operating income in lower-tax or tax-free jurisdictions. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.94 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months ended June 30 was $216 million compared to $253 million for the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects lower income from operations in 2012, which was partially offset by working capital improvements, driven by lower inventory levels as we continue to work down our inventories. Capital spending for the first 6 months of this year was $137 million, relatively flat with last year. The largest portion of the capital spend this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our greenfield pharma plant we're building in Vizag, India. Our cash balance at June 30 was $720 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Moving next to guidance for the full year. We're maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis. However, the impact of foreign exchange is becoming more of a headwind and is now expected to contribute between negative 1% to negative 2% of decrease in sales. We're maintaining our gross margin range of 35% to 37%, but we do anticipate we'll be at the low end of that range primarily as a result of a couple of items: first, greater-than-anticipated freight and distribution as we work diligently to deliver available product supply to our customers in a timely manner; and second, potential inventory losses and personnel expenses as we review our quality systems across all of our plants and assess outcome and required activities. For R&D, we're maintaining guidance in the 7% to 7.5% of sales range, but we anticipate that with the spending so far to date, we'll end up more towards the upper end of that range. We do expect SG&A to come down sequentially from the second quarter into the third quarter. As a result of all those items, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 10% to 11%. For adjusted EPS, we believe we'll be at the low end of our original guidance range at approximately $2 per share. 
Regarding our previous remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million, which includes remediation activities for both pharma and devices, while we've spent $235 million to date, our current estimates indicate we'll come in toward the upper end of the range, and we'll continue to carefully monitor these expenditures. We're decreasing our cash flow from operations guidance to a range of $475 million to $525 million primarily as a result of lower operating income both on a GAAP and on adjusted basis. In terms of calendarization, we expect to be down on both a sales and earnings per share basis sequentially from the second to third quarter, and then up again from the third to the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest sales quarter of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

We made good progress at Rocky Mount with our remediation activities. We continued our constructive dialogue with the FDA, and I was pleased with the outcome of our meetings with the agency. I believe they understand that we are committed to resolving the issues under the warning letter, and I believe, too, that they understand that we are committed to applying what we've learned at Rocky on a holistic basis to reinforce our entire foundation. And toward that end, we've undertaken activities at several of our other facilities, which have served for some additional issues, a few more gators in the swamp, so to speak, that we are addressing. This has unfortunately created some product shortage situation and required additional effort, cost and time on our part. But while our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive than we originally thought and may take more time to complete, it's the right thing to do for Hospira and for our customers and the patients they serve. We remain committed to driving as much improvement as possible this year while, at the same time, prioritize the needs of our customers to the best of our ability given the challenges with which we are dealing. We look forward to reaching the other side of our quality remediation, so we can resume the steady supply of products our customers and patients rely on and ultimately enjoy the benefits from our global expansion program and our investment in biosimilars. We are absolutely confident that once we get through this, we'll be even stronger than before. 
And with that, operator, we are ready for questions."

So let's just talk about, first of all, the progress we're making in terms of the plants under the warning letter, and the 2 plants under the warning letter are Rocky Mount and Clayton. So we had, as I said, an inspection at Clayton this quarter. We got a 483 with 6 noncritical observations, and the [indiscernible] at the end of the session with the investigators, as I mentioned previously, was we had made good progress. We seemed we're living up to our commitments, but there's additional work to do. And so with respect to our plants, I would say that that's where I see them right now, good progress being made. We're living up to our commitments, but there's still a lot of work to be done. With respect to the issues surfacing, you're correct in terms of there are more issues than we had previously thought, so as we are knocking out issues, more issues keep surfacing. But remember, this is deliberate. We are trying to drive to the surface all the issues we can in 2012 and take care of them, so the additional issues that you see surfacing, which often you see in terms of recalls, is really a sign of progress. It's not a sign of deterioration or going backwards. So with our new team onboard, what I've asked them to do is just drive into the issues, find them, uproot them, drive to root cause and get them solved. And so I think in that way, I feel very good about the progress. So far from being discouraged about the issues that are surfacing, I'm encouraged that we're getting them out in the open and we're able to deal with them. And that is a very important thing because the big concern before might have been that these issues were not manageable. All the issues that we've seen surface have been manageable, so again, manageable issues."

There'll be some minor impact, but the way the overhead structure's put together in Rocky Mount moving from, say, 65% up to 75%, up to 85%, there is some leverage we get on the overhead, but it's not a great deal. So I think over the longer term, if we can get the production up, keep the lab in sync with the quality coming off the line, we should have some opportunity to begin to take some of the people out of the operation. But in the near term, I wouldn't expect a lot of leverage from that. It's maybe more of a sales opportunity as we work backorders down and get back into a better supply position."

So in terms of Rocky Mount, as we look at it, what we said at the start of the year was we had a wide range from $2 to $2.30 as EPS number depending on which scenario held true. Scenario one, as you recall, was essentially that Rocky continued at that 60% to 70% rate through the year, and then that directed us to the lower end of the range. The other scenario had us having an inflection point midway through the year, and this would then take us towards the midpoint of the guidance. So what we've seen with Rocky then is a lot of issues, manageable issues, but it is taking time to get through them. And remediation does affect supply. So as we've got resources on remediation, it does not allow us to fully get supply out. What we're anticipating is we keep going at that rate in the third quarter, and then what we said very deliberately in the script is a gradual increase in the fourth quarter. So what I'm expecting right now then as we get through the third quarter is that we will be managing the supply up as remediation goes. Now we have a couple of other things that we did not envision when we put out our original guidance, and you referred to one of them, which was Clayton. So as I look at Clayton then, we have been through this with a fine-tooth comb in terms of what the root cause is of this particulate matter and our water for injection issues. We believe we have identified root cause, but right now, in the full transparency, we are working through to make sure that the fix we have against that root cause is working. The expectations from experts both inside the company and outside the company are that these fixes will work, and that's what gives us some comfort to say we should begin manufacturing some time late into the third quarter, but propofol release will not be until the fourth quarter. Of course, on the next quarter call, we'll be able to tell you whether or not that was successful, but at this point, we think there's a better chance than not that this plant gets back up and running again. With respect to our other plants, so as you look at McPherson then, recall that we had a full cGMP there at the end of last year. We got 6 noncritical observations. The agency then came back in, as I referred to, did a for-cause inspection on our overfills and issued no observations. So what that told us is that we have very manageable situation within the McPherson plant. As it pertains to Austin, as we reviewed Austin, we felt that it was appropriate to bring in the same oversight people Quintiles into Austin in order to ensure that all the learnings we had at Rocky are actually in place in Austin. And so we are in that process right now, and as I mentioned, the FDA just came in the door at pretty much the same time. So we will get a read from the FDA as to how we're doing in our Rocky -- in our Austin plant, pardon me, as we move forward here. I will say we did have a meeting with the Dallas District that I also attended to talk about the Austin facility, and again, pretty much the same reactions we've had in the other meetings, which was, based on what we've said, it looks like good progress being made, but more needs to be done. And that's exactly the basis from which I say that I believe we're making good progress, but definitely, more needs to be done. In terms of moving forward then, so what do we see is the next kind of guidepost here? I really look at it as being the Rocky Mount inspection. We're anticipating that it should happen either later this year or early next year. And from my standpoint then, that will be an excellent view as to how exactly we're doing and are we turning the corner on our remediation efforts at Rocky. So my net-net here is the issues in the other plants are not to the same extent as Rocky. Rocky is simply a much bigger place. And I feel that we're getting our arms around it. We've identified the issues, and we're taking the appropriate action."

What I said in the past in terms of permanent costs, we're at least looking at about 300 basis points of costs that's been added in so far. As far as what that's going to look like for next year, it's just a little bit too early to tell, but to date, it's somewhere between 250, 300 basis points of permanent costs permanent for the medium term. And as we get through the process of getting our 2013 budgets and plans put together, we'll have a better idea of whether we maintain at that level or can take some costs out or you have to slightly increase.

That's going to rapidly accelerate over 2013, 2014. And these are just the initial theories of molecules. We even haven't gotten into the second bucket of molecules that we want to get into just because of the amount of timing and resource it will take and the skills we need. So in terms of when they will get approval and our decision to launch, it depends on the country. Sometimes, it takes anywhere from 10 to 12 months in the fastest-moving countries, and sometimes, as you know in the U.S., it's sitting at 30 to 36 months. So it will be somewhere in that range, depending on approval. So that's how we want to get in these markets for submissions as fast as possible and accelerate our approval process with the health authorities as part of this process. So I can't tell you per molecule exactly when and where, but this process is moving very fast in the company. And as Mike has committed to, investments in this area, they are just starting to bear fruit in terms of submissions. Trastuzumab, Herceptin, as you mentioned, we are actually in this particular molecule in collaboration with Celltrion. Celltrion is involved in the development of this particular molecule, and they have, as they have mentioned previously, gone -- they're in the development phase in this particular molecule and will be ready for submission in the very near future. We won't comment on the submission date because we are depending on them on that particular dossier, but when they are ready, we are very closely collaborating with them.

I mean, obviously, we've uncovered more issues. But as I said, the good news is the issues are manageable and were surfacing now. I believe we've done a nice job working constructively with the FDA, and they've done a nice job with us in terms of moving the whole remediation plan forward. And as I said in our meeting with them at the center, they were pleased with our progress, pleased with our commitment to it, I think pleased with the investment that we are putting behind it and also, I think from a commitment standpoint, pleased that we weren't just going to the letter of the commitments, but we were going to the spirit of the commitments to get things done. So as I look at the number of inspections we've had recently, they are verifying that we are where we said we were, which is making progress but a ways to go. And so in terms of the Austin facility, obviously, you'd like more time, but they should go in there. They should see progress that we are making. And if we get the same result that we got in Clayton, I'll be satisfied. So as I move through the year, I'm looking at our global expansion. It really is getting lags, as Sumant said, 50 new-to-country submissions are going in the back half of this year, and we've got a ton more going in next year. Our biosimilars program is progressing. We've got EPO in the clinical trials. We have a path forward on biosimilars. We have infliximab submitted in Europe. So things are moving forward from that respect. As I look at Vizag, it's coming into view now in 2014, and that plant construction continues to go well. As I look at our new team, and we brought in, just in the last few months, a new Chief Medical Officer, new Head of Regulatory, Head of Quality, Head of U.S. Ops, Head of Operations, Head of Devices, so I think we've transformed the team here into a team that can really move this company forward. So a very important point for us then and to answer your question on Rocky Mount, how will we know we'd get there, it's essentially with the FDA inspection, which I said I would anticipate at the end of the year, beginning of the year. And if we pass that test, then I think we can say we have satisfied the FDA and then we're, to use baseball parlance, we're tagging third and headed for home on reinforcing the foundation with our growth drivers as a company intact and having the opportunity to get supply going. Having said all that, we still have a lot to do in terms of the remediation work, and these expenses are more than we had originally anticipated. So as we work through the year, we can give you more color towards the end."

Tom will then provide a deeper dive into the financials and wrap up with a discussion on guidance. 
In line with the approach we have adopted since the acceleration of our remediation activities last year, we're providing as much disclosure as we can under the circumstances, including a list of FDA inspections since our last quarter call. We continue to progress with our remediation and move towards recovery, making for a very busy quarter. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the FDA, meeting with them on several occasions both at the agency's headquarters and the district offices. We had several FDA inspections both at our plants and at our corporate headquarters. Third, we continue to progress with our remediation efforts at Rocky Mount. Our annual preventive maintenance shutdown went as planned, and we are bringing the lines back into production. Fourth, we are sharing our learnings at Rocky and other facilities across the organization to ensure implementation of best practices and to holistically put in place modern and robust quality processes and systems. 
As our remediation program progresses across our plants, we have uprooted additional issues, some of which have unfortunately resulted in product recalls, inventory loss and production disruptions. We are driving to root cause and implementing corrective actions. As we have said in the past, we believe identifying and resolving these issues signify that we are moving in the right direction on our journey to achieving sustainable compliance. 
Let me provide additional details on some of these activities, starting with Rocky Mount. First of all, as I mentioned, we've made significant progress with our remediation efforts at the plant. We went into our midyear scheduled maintenance shutdown in early July. 10 days later, we started the plant back up in a phased approach and are returning to the 60% to 70% production and release levels. We expect to remain at this level during the third quarter and then modestly increase through the end of the year. During the maintenance shutdown, we took advantage of the downtime to advance our modernization at the plant, including completing various facility upgrades and commencing activity to fully automate our visual inspection process. Over time, these efforts will lead to greater efficiency at Rocky and ultimately faster release rates and improved supply levels. 
Second, our intent is to begin ramping down the level of consultants at Rocky. We are building up a robust number of trained internal employees to do the work on the plant floor, and by year end, we expect the number of consultants to gradually decline as their role becomes limited to overseeing remediation activities. We are pleased by the progress at the facility, and I want to thank all of those at Rocky Mount for their tremendous work and effort. 
And third, and I know many of you are looking forward to an update on our interactions with the FDA, we have continued to have constructive and productive dialogue with the agency, including 2 meetings on Rocky Mount, during which we discussed our comprehensive action plan and our progress to date. One of the meetings was at the FDA's headquarters, or the Center, and included representatives from districts, as well as the Office of Compliance and the Office of Drug Shortage. While final minutes of the meeting are circulating at the agency for comments, we believe the FDA has accepted the work plan that we previously submitted. The agency acknowledged that we were moving in the right direction with the right level of commitment, but indicated they needed to see continued progress. We realized that much work remains to be done but left the meeting encouraged. 
As part of our continuing global quality efforts, we are reviewing our quality systems across all of our plants. Where there are gaps, we are bringing in third-party support on an interim basis as we improve the system. We've already started implementing this at Austin and Boulder, and we'll be looking at the other plants as we proceed through our assessments. The oversight is on a much smaller scale than what we have at Rocky Mount and commensurate with the assessment outcome and required activities. For example, at Austin, we brought in a handful of consultants to assist in our quality improvement efforts. 
As far as recent inspections, at our Clayton plant, which was originally cited under the 2010 warning letter along with Rocky Mount, the FDA conducted a full cGMP inspection, which resulted in 6 noncritical observations regarding stability studies, sampling documentation and methodology and equipment validations. It is important to note that investigators did not cite any of the observations as repeat observations, and in fact, each of the 3 investigators made positive comments regarding the progress we have made at Clayton as part of our quality journey. In addition, as discussed during our first quarter earnings call in May, we previously experienced some manufacturing issues at the plant related to the water for injection system and the observance of particulate in final product in test batches. As a result, we did not release any significant amount of product during the quarter at Clayton. This has resulted in a shortage situation with propofol, as well as impacting supply to certain contract manufacturing customers. We believe we have addressed the root cause of the issues and have taken appropriate steps to correct these issues, but need to demonstrate the effectiveness of our corrective actions. If all goes according to plan, we should be back up and manufacturing sometime in the third quarter and releasing product in the fourth quarter. 
At our Boulder plant, the FDA performed an inspection at the facility and issued 7 observations. Boulder is a small oncolytic API plant, and the observation centered around cleaning validation, process validation and laboratory investigations. We have responded the FDA with our plan to address the observations, and in a subsequent meeting, the agency did not object to the scope of our planned corrections. 
At McPherson, the FDA came back to the plant for a focused inspection on the issue related to overfilled Carpuject vials we experienced earlier this quarter, and no observations were issued. 
At ZHOPL, which is our joint-venture facility in India, the site had its first full cGMP inspection since its initial inspection, and no observations were issued. 
At Austin, just this Monday, the FDA began both a follow-up inspection and a general cGMP inspection of this site. 
We recognize that we are receiving heightened scrutiny from the FDA as the agency is interested in monitoring our progress and ensuring compliance across our manufacturing facilities. We support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our manufacturing footprint. 
Finally, on the device side of the house. We continue to make progress on our comprehensive device review and are advancing our efforts in this regard. Although most of the investigations are targeted to be completed towards the end of the year and end of 2013, a few corrective actions, including field recalls, have already been initiated. Also, the FDA recently inspected the device design controls and complaint system at our Lake Forest facility and issued a 483 with 10 observations. The observations principally related to complaint handling and documentation, supplier quality and regulatory labeling. We are working on a response to the agency, which is due in early August. 
So as you can see, we had a very busy quarter and continue to move forward with both our pharma and device remediation efforts. I realize that some of you are concerned about the length of time this is taking and that additional issues keep bubbling up. However, from my perspective, we are making progress, and we are seeing encouraging signs of improvement. At Rocky Mount, many of our metrics are now moving in the right direction, such as first pass quality and production schedule adherence, which are leading indicators of the health of our plant. Across our facilities, with the vigilance of our strong new operations and quality leadership, we are closing out investigations faster, using a more effective and vigorous process to drive to resolution. Using the swamp analogy I've referenced over the past several quarters, we are draining the swamp and dealing with the gators we have uncovered. As I've reiterated numerous times, I am committed to resolving our quality issue and getting as much done in 2012 as possible. I believe the FDA understands, and I know that our employees do as well, my commitment in this respect. But it is not a quick fix. It's complex. It takes time and money, and there may be additional gators yet to be uncovered along the way. That said, I know we'll get through this. It's a matter of when, not if. And when we do, we'll be in a much stronger competitive position. 
We also remain focused on our growth initiatives, and we are moving forward with our growth expansion plans and the related regulatory filings. During the second half of the year, we expect to make significant progress with the goal of filing approximately 50 new-to-country submissions by the end of the year. This is in line with our original timeline, and we expect to start seeing commercial gains in the 2014, 2015 time frame. 
In addition, we were pleased to have recently transitioned China from a third-party distribution model to a direct commercial presence. We currently have a staff of approximately 60 employees there, who celebrated the first sales to hospitals under our new direct model in China. 
Our overarching goal is to grow profitably, which, admittedly, is challenging during the remediation process. However, we believe that as we reduce complexity at our plants as part of the remediation process, we will realize additional optimization as a natural outcome of the process. We're also continuing to drive product rationalization, and towards this objective, we initiated plans in June to exit a niche solutions product line over the course of the next 6 months. Furthermore, we continue to aggressively pursue price increases for products across our regions. 
On the growth side, our relationship with Celltrion is starting to bear fruit. During the quarter, we filed our biosimilar dossier with the European health authority for infliximab, a biologic that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other indications, which we will market under the brand name INFLECTRA. The dossier is currently under review, and we have been in active communication with the health authority. We plan to apply the experience we gained with our current 2 biosimilars to commercializing INFLECTRA at market formation. 
In addition, this month, we will be relaunching oxaliplatin, an oncology drug. You may recall we were the first to launch oxaliplatin in 2009 after successfully challenging the originator's patent. 
Finally, before moving to the sales discussion, I'd like to highlight 2 recent additions to Hospira. We were very pleased to announce yesterday that Dennis Fenton joined our Board of Directors. Dennis' unparalleled experience with biologics manufacturing and operations quality make him an excellent fit for the board, and we look forward to working with him, enjoying the benefits of his contributions. We also welcomed Neil Ryding during the quarter to the newly established role of Senior Vice President, Devices. Neil, with his extensive device background, will bring significant focus and experience to this billion-dollar business. 
Turning now to our sales results for the quarter. As a reminder, all references to net sales results are on a constant-currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. Net sales were relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2011. Strong volumes in certain specialty injectable products outside the U.S. and higher device sales were offset by a difficult comparison to second quarter 2011 performance, which saw strong U.S. sales from the launch of docetaxel, as well as a positive contribution from several other launched compounds. 
By product line, global specialty injectable net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Very strong SIP performance in EMEA and APAC were not enough to offset soft results in the Americas. 
Let me now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable sales were down 6% for the second quarter. The decline related to several factors. First, docetaxel. Docetaxel continued to perform well in the quarter. Market share remains at almost 50%, with pricing still at approximately 60% off the branded product pricing, higher than expected levels. However, the second quarter of 2011 was the first full quarter post-launch for docetaxel, which creates the difficult year-over-year comparison. Second, propofol. As I mentioned earlier, due to manufacturing issues at Clayton, we released very little propofol. What we did release was from inventory manufactured in 2011. Third, we saw year-over-year price declines on some of the products we launched in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011, such as gemcitabine, due to competitive market conditions. And fourth was the impact of supply issues primarily driven by remediation activities, which affected several of our products, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs. Partially offsetting decline in SIP in the Americas was continued strength in Precedex during the quarter. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 20% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were meropenem, which continued to perform exceptionally well, and Nivestim, our biosimilar filgrastim product. The additional sales staff we added has been beneficial in increasing adoption of filgrastim across Europe. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables increased 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by initial stocking from our entry into China and continued positive performance of Precedex in both Japan and Korea. 
Turning now to Medication Management, global net sales increased 6% during the second quarter. We have seen increased momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps and IV clinical integration systems. Sales in our Other Pharma product line were down 4% in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to softness in solutions as a result of supply constraints. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

Mike has taken you through the sales, and I'll run you through the rest of the income statement, cash flow and then talk a little bit about guidance. First, adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales in the quarter w",777,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Mike has taken you through the sales, and I'll run you through the rest of the income statement, cash flow and then talk a little bit about guidance. First, adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales in the quarter was 36%, which was down from the 41% in the second quarter of 2011. This is due primarily to costs associated with strengthening our quality systems, lower manufacturing volumes, inventory losses, particularly in Clayton, as well as price declines on some of our 2010 and 2011 product launches that Mike mentioned before. 
Moving to R&D expense, it was up 27% in the second quarter to $84 million. This primarily is a result of higher biosimilar clinical trial spending, as well as the continuation of our global expansion program. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 8% compared to 6% in the second quarter of last year. SG&A expense for the second quarter was $170 million, up 9% from $156 million from the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as slightly higher corporate expenses. 
Adjusted operating income was $117 million compared to $212 million in the second quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 20% in last year's second quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 23% on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of last year. Reduced rate results from increased expenses in higher-tax rate jurisdictions, as well as a greater mix of operating income in lower-tax or tax-free jurisdictions. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.94 for the same period last year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months ended June 30 was $216 million compared to $253 million for the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects lower income from operations in 2012, which was partially offset by working capital improvements, driven by lower inventory levels as we continue to work down our inventories. Capital spending for the first 6 months of this year was $137 million, relatively flat with last year. The largest portion of the capital spend this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our greenfield pharma plant we're building in Vizag, India. Our cash balance at June 30 was $720 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Moving next to guidance for the full year. We're maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant-currency basis. However, the impact of foreign exchange is becoming more of a headwind and is now expected to contribute between negative 1% to negative 2% of decrease in sales. We're maintaining our gross margin range of 35% to 37%, but we do anticipate we'll be at the low end of that range primarily as a result of a couple of items: first, greater-than-anticipated freight and distribution as we work diligently to deliver available product supply to our customers in a timely manner; and second, potential inventory losses and personnel expenses as we review our quality systems across all of our plants and assess outcome and required activities. For R&D, we're maintaining guidance in the 7% to 7.5% of sales range, but we anticipate that with the spending so far to date, we'll end up more towards the upper end of that range. We do expect SG&A to come down sequentially from the second quarter into the third quarter. As a result of all those items, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 10% to 11%. For adjusted EPS, we believe we'll be at the low end of our original guidance range at approximately $2 per share. 
Regarding our previous remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million, which includes remediation activities for both pharma and devices, while we've spent $235 million to date, our current estimates indicate we'll come in toward the upper end of the range, and we'll continue to carefully monitor these expenditures. We're decreasing our cash flow from operations guidance to a range of $475 million to $525 million primarily as a result of lower operating income both on a GAAP and on adjusted basis. In terms of calendarization, we expect to be down on both a sales and earnings per share basis sequentially from the second to third quarter, and then up again from the third to the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest sales quarter of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

We made good progress at Rocky Mount with our remediation activities. We continued our constructive dialogue with the FDA, and I was pleased with the outcome of our meetings with the agency. I believe they understand that we are committed to resolving the issues under the warning letter, and I believe, too, that they understand that we are committed to applying what we've learned at Rocky on a holistic basis to reinforce our entire foundation. And toward that end, we've undertaken activities at several of our other facilities, which have surfaced some additional issues, a few more gators in the swamp, so to speak, that we are addressing. This has unfortunately created some product shortage situation and required additional effort, cost and time on our part. But while our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive than we originally thought and may take more time to complete, it's the right thing to do for Hospira and for our customers and the patients they serve. We remain committed to driving as much improvement as possible this year while, at the same time, prioritize the needs of our customers to the best of our ability given the challenges with which we are dealing. We look forward to reaching the other side of our quality remediation, so we can resume the steady supply of products our customers and patients rely on and ultimately enjoy the benefits from our global expansion program and our investment in biosimilars. We are absolutely confident that once we get through this, we'll be even stronger than before.

So let's just talk about, first of all, the progress we're making in terms of the plants under the warning letter, and the 2 plants under the warning letter are Rocky Mount and Clayton. So we had, as I said, an inspection at Clayton this quarter. We got a 483 with 6 noncritical observations, and the gestalt at the end of the session with the investigators, as I mentioned previously, was we had made good progress. We seemed we're living up to our commitments, but there's additional work to do. And so with respect to our plants, I would say that, that's where I see them right now, good progress being made. We're living up to our commitments, but there's still a lot of work to be done. With respect to the issues surfacing, you're correct in terms of there are more issues than we had previously thought, so as we are knocking out issues, more issues keep surfacing. But remember, this is deliberate. We are trying to drive to the surface all the issues we can in 2012 and take care of them, so the additional issues that you see surfacing, which often you see in terms of recalls, is really a sign of progress. It's not a sign of deterioration or going backwards. So with our new team onboard, what I've asked them to do is just drive into the issues, find them, uproot them, drive to root cause and get them solved. And so I think in that way, I feel very good about the progress. So far from being discouraged about the issues that are surfacing, I'm encouraged that we're getting them out in the open and we're able to deal with them. And that is a very important thing because the big concern before might have been that these issues were not manageable. All the issues that we've seen surface have been manageable, so again, manageable issues."

There'll be some minor impact, but the way the overhead structure's put together in Rocky Mount moving from, say, 65% up to 75%, up to 85%, there is some leverage we get on the overhead, but it's not a great deal. So I think over the longer term, if we can get the production up, keep the lab in sync with the quality coming off the line, we should have some opportunity to begin to take some of the people out of the operation. But in the near term, I wouldn't expect a lot of leverage from that. It's maybe more of a sales opportunity as we work backorders down and get back into a better supply position."

So in terms of Rocky Mount, as we look at it, what we said at the start of the year was we had a wide range from $2 to $2.30 as EPS number depending on which scenario held true. Scenario one, as you recall, was essentially that Rocky continued at that 60% to 70% rate through the year, and then that directed us to the lower end of the range. The other scenario had us having an inflection point midway through the year, and this would then take us towards the midpoint of the guidance. So what we've seen with Rocky then is a lot of issues, manageable issues, but it is taking time to get through them. And remediation does affect supply. So as we've got resources on remediation, it does not allow us to fully get supply out. What we're anticipating is we keep going at that rate in the third quarter, and then what we said very deliberately in the script is a gradual increase in the fourth quarter. So what I'm expecting right now then as we get through the third quarter is that we will be managing the supply up as remediation goes. Now we have a couple of other things that we did not envision when we put out our original guidance, and you referred to one of them, which was Clayton. So as I look at Clayton then, we have been through this with a fine-tooth comb in terms of what the root cause is of this particulate matter and our water for injection issues. We believe we have identified root cause, but right now, in the full transparency, we are working through to make sure that the fix we have against that root cause is working. The expectations from experts both inside the company and outside the company are that these fixes will work, and that's what gives us some comfort to say we should begin manufacturing some time late into the third quarter, but propofol release will not be until the fourth quarter. Of course, on the next quarter call, we'll be able to tell you whether or not that was successful, but at this point, we think there's a better chance than not that this plant gets back up and running again. With respect to our other plants, so as you look at McPherson then, recall that we had a full cGMP there at the end of last year. We got 6 noncritical observations. The agency then came back in, as I referred to, did a for-cause inspection on our overfills and issued no observations. So what that told us is that we have very manageable situation within the McPherson plant. As it pertains to Austin, as we reviewed Austin, we felt that it was appropriate to bring in the same oversight people, Quintiles, into Austin in order to ensure that all the learnings we had at Rocky are actually in place in Austin. And so we are in that process right now, and as I mentioned, the FDA just came in the door at pretty much the same time. So we will get a read from the FDA as to how we're doing in our Rocky -- in our Austin plant, pardon me, as we move forward here. I will say we did have a meeting with the Dallas District that I also attended to talk about the Austin facility, and again, pretty much the same reactions we've had in the other meetings, which was, based on what we've said, it looks like good progress being made, but more needs to be done. And that's exactly the basis from which I say that I believe we're making good progress, but definitely, more needs to be done. In terms of moving forward then, so what do we see is the next kind of guidepost here? I really look at it as being the Rocky Mount inspection. We're anticipating that it should happen either later this year or early next year. And from my standpoint then, that will be an excellent view as to how exactly we're doing and are we turning the corner on our remediation efforts at Rocky. So my net-net here is the issues in the other plants are not to the same extent as Rocky. Rocky is simply a much bigger place. And I feel that we're getting our arms around it. We've identified the issues, and we're taking the appropriate action."

So where would you right now, given your current plans, expect to exit the year sort of above that, relative to the 60% to 70% range, as we think about what the run rate into 2013 might look like? And then related to that, the third-party oversight expense does continue to increase sequentially. I think you've given us some color as to why that is, but maybe on the incremental profitability question, sort of where is your level of confidence in what the kind of base expense or sort of total quality expense that you're going to have to add into the business on sort of a permanent and ongoing basis really looks like? Or is that one area where it's still a work in progress in terms of what that's going to look like, and when do you think we will have sort of confidence on that front?"

What I said in the past in terms of permanent costs, we're at least looking at about 300 basis points of costs that's been added in so far. As far as what that's going to look like for next year, it's just a little bit too early to tell, but to date, it's somewhere between 250, 300 basis points of permanent costs -- permanent for the medium term.

And as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are thinking approximately 50 submissions going in this year all though the globe, not all in Europe but in many parts of the world. That's going to rapidly accelerate over 2013, 2014. And these are just the initial series of molecules. We even haven't gotten into the second bucket of molecules that we want to get into just because of the amount of timing and resource it will take and the skills we need. So in terms of when they will get approval and our decision to launch, it depends on the country. Sometimes, it takes anywhere from 10 to 12 months in the fastest-moving countries, and sometimes, as you know in the U.S., it's sitting at 30 to 36 months. So it will be somewhere in that range, depending on approval. So that's how we want to get in these markets for submissions as fast as possible and accelerate our approval process with the health authorities as part of this process. So I can't tell you per molecule exactly when and where, but this process is moving very fast in the company. And as Mike has committed to, investments in this area, they are just starting to bear fruit in terms of submissions. Trastuzumab, Herceptin, as you mentioned, we are actually in this particular molecule in collaboration with Celltrion. Celltrion is involved in the development of this particular molecule, and they have, as they have mentioned previously, gone -- they're in the development phase in this particular molecule and will be ready for submission in the very near future. We won't comment on the submission date because we are depending on them on that particular dossier, but when they are ready, we are very closely collaborating with them. We will go through the process and submit our parallel dossier at that time."

I mean, obviously, we've uncovered more issues. But as I said, the good news is the issues are manageable and were surfacing now. I believe we've done a nice job working constructively with the FDA, and they've done a nice job with us in terms of moving the whole remediation plan forward. And as I said in our meeting with them at the Center, they were pleased with our progress, pleased with our commitment to it, I think pleased with the investment that we are putting behind it and also, I think from a commitment standpoint, pleased that we weren't just going to the letter of the commitments, but we were going to the spirit of the commitments to get things done. So as I look at the number of inspections we've had recently, they are verifying that we are where we said we were, which is making progress but a ways to go. And so in terms of the Austin facility, obviously, you'd like more time, but they should go in there. They should see progress that we are making. And if we get the same result that we got in Clayton, I'll be satisfied. So as I move through the year, I'm looking at our global expansion. It really is getting legs, as Sumant said, 50 new-to-country submissions are going in the back half of this year, and we've got a ton more going in next year. Our biosimilars program is progressing. We've got EPO in the clinical trials. We have a path forward on biosimilars. We have infliximab submitted in Europe. So things are moving forward from that respect. As I look at Vizag, it's coming into view now in 2014, and that plant construction continues to go well. As I look at our new team -- and we brought in, just in the last few months, a new Chief Medical Officer, new Head of Regulatory, Head of Quality, Head of U.S. Ops, Head of Operations, Head of Devices, so I think we've transformed the team here into a team that can really move this company forward. So a very important point for us then and to answer your question on Rocky Mount, how will we know we'd get there, it's essentially with the FDA inspection, which I said I would anticipate at the end of the year, beginning of the year. And if we pass that test, then I think we can say we have satisfied the FDA and then we're, to use baseball parlance, we're tagging third and headed for home on reinforcing the foundation with our growth drivers as a company intact and having the opportunity to get supply going. Having said all that, we still have a lot to do in terms of the remediation work, and these expenses are more than we had originally anticipated. So as we work through the year, we can give you more color towards the end."

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2011 conference call. 2011 was a challenging year, but despite our manufacturing challenges, the fundamental growth opportunities remain intact and our future is bright. We wrapped up the year with sales of over $4 billion. We progressed with our quality remediation efforts. We met the high end of our revised earnings range and we set the groundwork to implement our vision of global expansion.
We're going to cover 5 things with you this morning. Number one, an update on our quality transformation; second, a discussion of our leadership changes; third, a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results; fourth, a pipeline update; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
The most recent update we provided on our quality transformation was at the JPMorgan conference on January 10. I said at that time, and will reiterate on our call today, that reinforcing the foundation is our #1 priority. I continue to be personally involved in discussions with the FDA and am closely monitoring our progress. At JPMorgan, as you may recall, we discussed our headway to date at Rocky Mount, including submitting our comprehensive remediation plan to the FDA, closing out documentation more quickly to be able to more expeditiously release product, ramping up third-party assistance and oversight and bringing in a new team of leadership at Rocky Mount to drive sustainable cultural change. At the conference, we heard that there was some confusion regarding our planned maintenance shutdown of Rocky. Some investors had the impression that the shutdown was FDA-imposed. I want to clarify that this was not the case. Every December, Rocky shuts down for general preventative maintenance. We conducted our regularly scheduled maintenance shutdowns in late December as usual. We then elected to extend the amount of time the plant was shut down, as well as halted the release of product to allow us to work on certain issues and advance some capital improvements. At JPMorgan, we indicated that we expected production and product releases to resume in a staged manner over the coming weeks. So what has happened since our last update in January? Well, Rocky Mount completed its shutdown. In mid-January, the plant started producing product and over the course of the following weeks, began releasing product. Rocky's current production levels are returning to where they were prior to the shutdown, in the 60% to 70% range.
We have continued our regular constructive dialogues with the agency regarding our current progress. We have not entered into any discussions with the agency regarding a consent decree. As we have mentioned numerous times in the past, we would tell you if this were to happen. We are scheduled to meet with the agency in the next couple of weeks and expect that our remediation plan will be a topic of the discussion at that meeting. In the interim, we are continuing to implement the remediation plan as submitted.
At our Austin plant, you may recall we indicated that we had signed on a third-party consulting firm, Lachman, to verify the status of our 483 commitments. Lachman finished their audit and concluded that 100% of the commitments we made in our action plan have been fully addressed.
At our McPherson plant, we submitted our response to the FDA regarding the 483 observations from the inspection that closed out in early January of this year. We will be meeting with the FDA shortly to discuss our response and are proceeding to work through that plan. Finally, we continue to advance our efforts proactively and holistically across our manufacturing footprint to assess our readiness for future FDA inspections.  I'll reiterate that I remain firmly committed to reinforcing our foundation and instilling a culture of high quality throughout this organization. I am confident that, as a result of our initiatives, Hospira will be even better positioned as the world's leading provider of the highest quality injectable drugs and infusion technologies.
Before I turn to our sales results, I want to take a minute to highlight some recent leadership changes. We are pleased to welcome 2 talented individuals to our senior leadership team. Richard Davies as our Chief Commercial Officer, and Zena Kaufman as our Senior Vice President of Quality. Richard is an accomplished and dynamic global commercial executive, and we expect to leverage his deep expertise, especially on the pharma and biologic sides, to advance our leadership position worldwide. Zena is a recognized global expert in pharmaceutical quality systems and compliance and will help establish quality as a strategic, competitive advantage across our global operation. With these 2 new appointments, I'm highly confident in my current senior leadership team. Our focus now is on relentless execution as we reinforce our foundation and drive growth.
I'll now turn to our sales results for the quarter and full year, after which Tom will discuss the financials. As a reminder, our references to net sales results will be on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line.
On a constant currency basis, net sales were up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, net sales were up 2% versus full year 2010.
By product line, Global Specialty Injectable net sales increased 3% for the quarter and 7% for the year.
By region, in the Americas, Specialty Injectable sales were up 4% for the fourth quarter, primarily related to  contributions from docetaxel in the U.S., as well as several of our other SIP drugs such as Precedex, gemcitabine and propofol. For the full year, SIP in the Americas grew 9%.
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of Specialty Injectables were down 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Exceptionally strong performance in meropenem and volume share gains on core injectables were more than offset by competitive pricing pressure, primarily on oncology molecules. For the full year, SIP declined 2%.
In APAC, net sales of Specialty Injectables increased 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. Precedex in Japan had a record quarter for sales and both docetaxel and meropenem continued to gain momentum in the region, bringing the year to a strong close.
Turning now to Medication Management. The fourth quarter was a milestone for our Device business. For the first time in 2011, as a result of stronger device sales, we saw an increase in global net Medication Management sales of 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. As a reminder, we completed the validation of our remediated Plum alarm circuit boards in October. In addition to installing the new boards, in a portion of our existing inventory to meet demand for new devices, we have also been ramping up the field remediation of devices already in use by existing customers. While the bulk of the remediation will be completed in 2012, we anticipate spillover into 2013. Regarding our 510(k) process for Symbiq, we are in the process of responding to the second series of questions we received from the FDA. Once we submit our response, which will be by the end of this quarter, we're expecting a final decision from the agency.
We continue to make progress on our comprehensive device review as well. We have completed the risk assessment phase on our largest infusion pump families and are conducting investigations to assess the level of risk and drive to root cause.
Relative to the full year, global MMS declined 3%, mainly due to the Plum remediation that was pending for most of the year.
Sales in our Other pharma product line decreased 2% for the quarter on a global basis and 11% for the year. This primarily reflects the impact to our contract manufacturing business of the heightened quality transformation actions we've been taking at our pharma manufacturing facilities and the resulting delays in releasing product.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter was 34.0%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was due primarily to inventory losses and certain quality actions.  For the full year, adjusted gross margin finished at 38.5% which was in line with our revised guidance for the year.
Research and development expense in the fourth quarter was $67 million or 6.6% of revenue. For the full year, R&D expense was 6.4% of revenue.
SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $167 million or 16.5% of revenue. And for the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.7%.

Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.2%. This was due to a lower amount of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions, and this brought our year-to-date effective tax rate to 20.5%, which was consistent with the effective tax rate last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.51 compared to $0.77 last year. And full year 2011 adjusted EPS on a diluted basis was $3.04.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $434 million compared to $315 million generated in 2010. The increase this year is a result of lower comparative investments in working capital, which primarily reflect the timing of receivables collections and chargeback payments related to U.S. sales of oxaliplatin, as well as a discretionary pension contribution that we made in 2010.
Capital spending was $291 million compared to $209 million in 2010. The increase reflects investments we are making relative to capacity expansion efforts, primarily at our pharmaceutical plant under construction in Vizag, India.
Our cash balance at December 31 was $598 million, up from $527 million at September 30, but down slightly from $604 million at the end of last year.
Finally, on goodwill impairment. Although we perform our goodwill impairment test annually, as of September 30, the decrease in our stock price in the fourth quarter and updated projections for 2012 triggered an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, we recognized additional goodwill impairment charges for the EMEA and APAC reporting segments.
Now before moving to guidance, Sumant will provide a brief update to our drug pipeline as we traditionally do at this time of the year. Sumant?"

You may recall that on our Investor Day in September of 2011, we revised how we present the pipeline to better reflect our strategy of globally expanding Hospira's portfolio. Instead of counting only the launches in limited major markets, as we previously did, we are now including all countries where the compounds in our pipeline are expected to launch. So for today's update, which is based on our pipeline as of December 31, 2011, is relative to the pipeline we discussed with you on Investor Day which was as of June 30, 2011.
As of December 31, 2011, our small molecule pipeline totaled 73 compounds, which represents a total of 603 new-to-country launches, including 40 in the U.S. The local market value of the small molecule pipeline now stands at approximately $17 billion.  In terms of therapeutic areas, roughly half of the total small molecule pipeline, in terms of local market value, are oncology drugs, with anti-infectives as the next largest therapeutic segment category at almost 1/4 of the pipeline's value. Relative to launch timing, drugs representing slightly more than a quarter of the overall local market value of the pipeline are expected to launch in various countries across our regions in 2012 and 2013. Of the local market value of the expected launches for these 2 years, roughly 40% is expected to occur in 2012, with the remainder in 2013. While many of these drugs are smaller launches from a local market value perspective, they add incremental value to our broad portfolio, which is already one of the largest portfolios of Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals worldwide.
Moving onto our biosimilars pipeline, it remains to one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with 11 compounds and a global branded value of $40 billion. We are already reaping benefits from our 2 biosimilars on the market. Our biosimilar EPO, also known as Retacrit in Europe, and our biosimilar filgrastim, also known as Nivestim, that has launched in both Europe and Australia.
I now turn back the call to Tom, who will provide our 2012 financial guidance. Tom?"
9681063,145104049,363713,"Hospira Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2012",2012-02-14,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. I'd like to take you",1309,"Thanks, Sumant. For 2012, we expect net sales to range between down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis compared with 2011, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting reported net sales by 1% based on current exchange rates. 
I'd like to take you through a couple of the assumptions we factored in to our net sales guidance. First for Rocky Mount, at the lower end of our sales guidance range, we have assumed that production remains at 60% to 70% throughout the entire year. As we move up in the guidance range, we've assumed that the facility remains at 60% to 70% through the first half of the year but that production and the pace of product release accelerate in the second half of the year.  Regarding other 483s, our guidance assumes that other facilities that currently have open 483s continue to make progress towards meeting the commitments communicating to the FDA and that future FDA inspections of our manufacturing facilities progress well.
Now relative to product launches. First, those products launched in 2011. We anticipate further erosion for some of these drugs as more competitors enter the market. But we believe we can maintain strong market share positions, and in certain cases, even grow our market share.  We've also planned additional country rollouts of products already in our portfolio, including Precedex, docetaxel, gemcitabine, meropenem, piperacillin, tazobactam and propofol.
Now for new pipeline launches in 2012, while we expect to launch numerous smaller drugs this year across our regions, as Sumant indicated, there are no new major drug launches assumed in the guidance. Relative to oxaliplatin, we're assuming an August relaunch in the United States as per our settlement. However, our guidance assumes that the market will be significantly more competitive for the drug than it was when we temporarily exited the market in 2010 as part of our settlement with the originator. On Symbiq, given that we cannot project the time line for FDA approval of our 510(k) application, we have dialed in 2 assumptions to guidance for Symbiq. At the lower end of the range, we've assumed that Symbiq does not receive approval in 2012. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes approval by midyear, with sales in the second half of 2012. And finally, on Precedex, we have assumed that we maintain market exclusivity in the United States throughout 2012.
Moving next to remediation costs. We expect these to remain in the $300 million to $375 million range that we highlighted on our last quarter call and at the JPMorgan conference in early January. As a reminder, that range includes costs related to both our pharma and device remediation activities. Now as far as the timing of these charges, we incurred $111 million of the $300 million to $375 million in the second half of 2011. Of the $111 million that we incurred in the second half of 2011, $76 million was recognized as onetime costs related primarily to third-party oversight and consulting costs, as well as costs associated with reduced production volumes at the Rocky Mount facility. The remaining $35 million of the $111 million was recorded as ongoing charges, and this was primarily related to inventory losses. Of the approximately $190 million to $265 million remaining of the $300 million to $375 million, we expect to incur about 60% to 70% of these costs in 2012 with the remaining amount in 2013.  We do expect the proportion of onetime costs to ongoing costs to be more heavily weighted towards onetime. In addition to these costs, we are also ramping up our permanent internal quality hiring efforts at our facilities.
Moving next to gross margins. Adjusted gross margins in 2012 are projected to be in the 35% to 37% range compared to 38.5% for 2011 and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline, relative to the full year of 2011, is expected to be driven by higher manufacturing costs related to reinforcing the foundation, lower volumes due to reduced output and some targeted inventory reductions. While continued price erosion on gemcitabine and docetaxel make for a difficult year-over-year comparison, we do expect lower inventory losses, as well as a positive mix effect from increased Precedex sales, will offset most of that negative impact.
In 2012, we expect research and development, and SG&A as a percentage of sales, will both increase approximately 80 to 90 basis points. Now the increase in R&D reflects the regulatory activities we are undertaking for our global SIP portfolio expansion, as well as advancements in our biosimilars program. The increase in SG&A reflects investments we are making in information technology, intellectual property litigation and sales and marketing. As a result of these factors, we're projecting 2012 adjusted operating income in the 12% to 13% range. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to decline in 2012 to a range of 18% to 20%, primarily due to lower earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions in 2012 versus 2011. Equity income from affiliates will decline by roughly half due to lower expected revenues and related margins from docetaxel.
Moving to earnings per share, we're assuming outstanding shares to be steady at $166 million which does not include any share buyback activity or option exercises, and we're projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.30.
Moving to cash flow, cash flow from operations projection for 2012 is in the range of $575 million to $625 million. Capital spending is projected to range between $350 million and $400 million, again, primarily related to the new facility we're building in Vizag, India, as well as modernization initiatives at some of our existing facilities.  Depreciation and amortization is expected to range between $240 million and $260 million.
In terms of quarterly calendarization, we expect that both net sales and adjusted earnings per share will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year as a result of some of the factors I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Those are improved productivity levels at Rocky Mount, potential approval of our Symbiq 510(k) submission and the August relaunch of oxaliplatin.
Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 5% to 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of our extended shutdown at the Rocky Mount facility in January.  We expect revenue to ramp up from first quarter levels over the remaining quarters of the year.
We expect adjusted gross margins to be up around 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011 and stay relatively flat throughout the year. Improvements to margins from increased production levels in the second half of the year are somewhat offset by scheduled factory maintenance shutdowns at some of our plants, midyear, and over the winter holidays.
For research and development, we expect a run rate every quarter in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales. SG&A also should remain at an absolute run rate similar to the fourth quarter of 2011, with the exception of first quarter of 2012 which will be up due to the annual grants associated with our long-term incentive plans.
Now finally, I'd like to update you on our long-term financial goals. We remain confident that the earnings potential for the company remains strong. We're making progress with our remediation efforts, we believe that, toward the end of the year, our production levels at Rocky Mount will increase and we will be releasing more product.  We expect improvements should accelerate as we complete our remediation efforts, commence manufacturing at our new factories in India and successfully launch our first biosimilar in the U.S. As we proceed through 2012, we hope to be able to quantify our longer-term financial goals.
Now with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some wrap-up comments."

But transformation comes with a price. Our results have been impacted, and we will continue to feel the impact over the near term. But we are making progress, and we will continue to move forward throughout this year. By the end of 2012, while our remediation efforts will not be entirely complete, we believe that we will have incurred the majority of the remediation costs. At the same time, we remain committed to drive toward sustainable growth, that's why I've charged the organization with advancing our global portfolio expansion efforts. It certainly isn't easy to undertake both of these major initiatives simultaneously, reinforcing the foundation and turbocharging growth, but from my relatively short time at Hospira, I know the organization has what it takes.
2011 turned out to be a very different year than I had imagined when I walked in the door here 10 months ago. But I can tell you, I remain as excited about Hospira's tremendous growth opportunities as the day I joined the company. Our business prospects and organic growth potential is strong. Our pipeline is rich with new opportunities, including biosimilars. It benefits from a great R&D model, short cycle times with a high probability of success. With approximately 80% of our business in the Americas today, we also have an unbelievable opportunity for globalization. And with the investment in our new flexible manufacturing plant in India, we will have the ability to drive substantial margin expansion. To boost our growth and profitability, we're investing for the future, with strategic capacity, best-in-class processes and people. Once we get through these short-term challenges, and we will, I'm firmly convinced that Hospira's quality improvement efforts will position us favorably for long-term success, cementing our leadership position as the world's leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies. I look forward to keeping you updated on our journey. 
So now, operator, we are ready for questions."

We are moving along, as I said before, in a partnership with the FDA, and I feel like we are doing the best at getting better, and I think the agency sees the extent of our efforts. A lot of the ongoing dialogue with the agency is to further reinforce that perception and, also, the fact that we will have a meeting with the agency over the next few weeks, which will include the discussion around our mediation efforts. I think will go, I hope again, a long way in cementing this partnership of getting our remediation plans blessed by the FDA and get us moving in a positive direction. Again, you never know what the agency's going to do. But at this particular juncture, as I've said, we have had no indication from them of, or any discussion with them of a consent decree. With respect to the second question on pumps and drugs being under the same house. Coming in the organization, I like the fact that both of these things flow through the same customer channel and from my standpoint, there is leverage between these 2 areas. I see some leverage, I indicated at the Investor Day that where we have pumps, we have approximately a 20% increased uptake of SIP. From my standpoint on going forward, I believe that we can continue to leverage these 2 areas and I believe that the company is much stronger having both of these product lines together under the same roof, then splitting them apart. As I think I've mentioned before in a previous life, I think there was very good reasons to spin out device because I did not believe that there was appropriate leverage. However, in a previous life as well, we've brought device back in because there was leverage with the pharmaceutical portion. And I believe that is the case as we see it here today."

There are quite a few drugs coming out of Rocky Mount that are showing up on the list. Propofol comes out of our Clayton facility, so that's not impacted by Rocky Mount.

So just a little bit better understanding of what are the variables and when we'll have visibility on those things as we move through the year. And then secondly, just Tom, I think to that earnings base question. I know you guys don't want to talk specifically about where it is,  but I think it will be helpful, just when you think about the operating expense base that you guys envision between R&D and SG&A this year. Should we be thinking that, going forward even as these remediation -- as you work through these problems that, that's a good level to about, and then you'll have volume leverage off of that going forward as things recover or are there more -- could we see more expenses come off as we get into 2013 and beyond just depending on the pace of remediation?"

So, Marshall, I'll take the first question and I'll throw the second one over to Tom then. So in thinking about the variables associated with production, moving forward, it is a factor of talking about with the FDA with respect to remediation. It also is a process here that we're in that as we uncover things, we drive to root cause, and in some circumstances another set of issues presents itself which have to go and solve. And that, in some ways, was the reason behind the extended shutdown in January at the Rocky Mount facility. Now, we are in a shutdown mode anyway, so it made remediation of these issues easier. But as you drive to root cause, you find these things. So it is very difficult to see exactly when these issues are finally solved and you can start moving up the supply recovery pathway, if you will. And then in conjunction with that, the FDA needs to be on board with the remediation plan. So we felt, as we looked at the year, that if we're going to have a theme for this year, it was going to be increasing the supply, that's the midrange. So getting the supply increased, high remediation efforts. It was going to take a lot of money. The question is to when the inflection point, of when supply starts to increase from that 60% to 70% level, is the one we're wrestling with, and given the range of our guidance, this is something that we're still wrestling with now. What I would say to you is, as we go through the first quarter and then into the call in the second quarter, we should have greater clarity on when that inflection point occurs and, hopefully, we can do something about narrowing the range. But right now, that's the situation we're in. As you look forward to 2013, what we're looking at there is, if we get this return to a better supply situation in the back half of '12, then we'll be looking stabilize that supply situation in '13, continue with remediation through '13 and we'll still have high expenses, but hopefully improving. And as you look out at '14, there's where I see that we're in an optimal supply situation, remediation should be completed, we're driving cost savings in the organization now, and then we get Vizag online. So as you step back, there's just a question now, as to precisely when we get that inflection point and it comes up. And what we've been looking out for this year is it occurs halfway through the year in the midpoint of our guidance or we continue at the same rate at the low point of our guidance."

The selling expenses, depending on portfolio expansion, where our new Head of Commercial would like to take the various regions -- I'd kind of hold off on commenting what selling expenses might look like another component of that, but there should be some leverage in SG&A.

If I sort of read through the commentary regarding first half or second half and the pacing of a recovery on the operating margin profile, et cetera, it sounds like the fourth quarter is probably a better picture of closer to where a normalized run rate might be. So if I just look at the midpoint of the guidance, it's sort of $2.15 and assume that more comes in the second half than in the first half and then you have your traditional seasonality in Q3 that makes Q4 a little stronger. That puts Q4 in the $0.70 range, I think, and that would kind of lead to an annualized number below $3 on a normalized basis. Would you disagree with that math?"

The 2 more significant ones are oxaliplatin, which would happen in August, and then the relaunch of Symbiq, which we're anticipating in the midrange, would be after the first half of the year.

Austin is quite a bit smaller than our Rocky Mount facility. And from my standpoint, as you look at the 483s, in my view, Rocky Mount had a lot more work to do than the Austin facility. Having said that, the Austin 483, as we mentioned before, was not great. And so I was very pleased that the plant went through the remediation process. They indicated to us that they've completed all their commitments. As I mentioned before, a couple  days later then we sent in Lachman to get a third-party verification on that. So I was extremely happy that everything is 100% a-okay from their standpoint. And we are looking, and continuing to look at, third parties reviewing our plants to ensure that, a, we're living up to our commitments, but also, b, that we have a state of FDA readiness as the FDA comes through with another round of reviews and inspections. In terms of the pricing situation, that's an interesting question. I think that, as the FDA continues to review and bring up the standards to which plants much operate under, then I think, necessarily, that can do a couple of things. One, it can certainly increase cost, but number two, it can increase barriers to entry. And from my standpoint, what I'm excited about is, I believe that we have a great opportunity here to meet the absolute highest quality standards. Obviously, it's painful right now, but I think we can meet those high-quality standards, and perhaps many others won't be able to or if they  less critical mass, it won't be worth it to them to do it.

As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales result",2110,"Thanks, Karen. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales results, which, like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations. Tom will provide a deeper dive into the financials, and I will wrap up with closing comments. 
As you are aware, we have been providing a list every quarter of current FDA inspections in the significant interactions between Hospira and the FDA. Due to the number of plants we operate, the FDA and other regulatory agencies are in our plants on a regular basis. However, the frequency of FDA inspections and interactions increased in the third quarter including and uptick of activity on our device operations. 
As we have said in the past, we support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will ensure that we are aligned and that our remediation efforts meet their expectations. Eventually, we expect the heightened quality systems and processes that we are implementing to be a competitive advantage. 
As I mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive and taking more time than we originally thought. And as we know now, they are costing more. But they results we're seeing underscore our belief that we are making progress with our pharma remediation. We are engaging more deeply and frequently with the agency. We are meeting with every district in which we have a major manufacturing facility in a very open and constructive manner, which we view as a positive, and we believe we are meeting the commitments we outlined to the agency in our various plant action plans. 
Let me highlight for you some of the progress we're making at Rocky Mount. First, the plant. Over the past couple of quarters, we made significant investments in capital improvements and facility modifications. For example, we have started building our new state-of-the-art quality control lab and have installed our first automated visual inspection machine in Rocky, which is currently being qualified. When you consider the volume of product involved, these improvements and others should have a meaningful impact over the long term in helping us produce high-quality products in a cost-efficient manner. 
Second, people. As planned, we have significantly decreased the number of consultants at the facility as they transition from frontline production activities toward more oversight and verification of our manufacturing and remediation activities. These consultants are being replaced with our own, newly hired and fully trained frontline employee operators and quality personnel to ensure that the training improvements we have in place are integrated and sustained. 
Third, process and technology. We are implementing information technology solutions to help us enhance our quality systems from systems that manage documentation and release to systems that track the training and qualifications of our employees. All of these changes are helping improve the robustness of our manufacturing practices, which should result in better first-pass quality, more stable production and eventually, lower waste in overall cost. 
And finally, in production and release levels. Our investments are yielding improvements. Our production and release levels are moving in the right direction as we continue with our plan to modestly increase our production levels through the end of the year in an effort to improve the supply of market-critical drugs. However, if increasing our production destabilizes the plant or adversely impacts our remediation efforts, we will adjust our production to release levels as necessary to sustain compliance. 
As we have said previously, we believe the next key milestone at Rocky Mount will be the FDA inspection of the facility. We are working diligently to ensure that we are fulfilling the commitments we outlined in our action plan and that we are fully meeting the expectations of the agency. 
Moving to Clayton. During the third quarter, we manufactured a limited amount of propofol. Based on reaching certain milestones, we plan on manufacturing and building inventory levels through the remainder of the year. We want to have an adequate supply of product prior to our reentry into the market, which we ultimately expect to be late this year or early next year. 
Regarding other facility inspection developments at Austin. We indicated we were inspected during the quarter and received the 483 with 19 observations. We have provided the FDA with a full response and set of commitments to address the 483 observations and are moving forward with our remediation efforts. 
At IKKT, our Hospira India anti-infective facility. The FDA performed an inspection of the plant, which resulted in a 483 with 5 observations. As a result of the observations, we made the decision to voluntarily stop production last month to expeditiously address certain observations related to aseptic practices and to put our operators through an extensive retraining and certification process. We have recently resumed producing and expect to be fully operational in the next few weeks. 
At McPherson. The FDA performed the full cGMP inspection. The inspection was recently completed and we received a 483 with 2 observations. The results of the inspection help confirm our belief that our remediation is largely on track. 
At our joint venture in India. The FDA performed an inspection at our facility, which resulted in 0 observations. 
Turning now to devices. At Costa Rica, as we disclosed, the FDA issued a warning letter in August on the facility following an inspection in April. We have provided the FDA with the response, which we believe fully addressed all of the matters cited in the Warning Letter. 
At Lake Forest, where the FDA inspected the device design controls and complaint system. If you recall, we received the 483 with 10 observations at the beginning of the third quarter. We have since submitted our action plan to the agency and remain on target to complete the commitments identified in the action plan. Last week, we received from the FDA what is referred to as an untitled letter. The letter indicates that the agency was not satisfied with the corrective actions we outlined to resolve 2 of the observations in the Form 483. We are working on a response to the agency to address their concerns. 
Regarding additional device developments. Last week, we initiated a voluntary recall with respect to our pumps, which was classified by the FDA as a Class 1 recall. This action is due to the devices LCD touchscreens that may occasionally not respond in the intended manner. The FDA is not requiring us to remove any Symbiq pumps from the field. We are in the process of sending a second field notification letter to our customers reiterating the appropriate steps to take with regard to this issue performance. While we anticipate that the major cause of the issue will be addressed with a software update, we are working to finalize an appropriate solution. In the interim, as we work through this issue with the agency, we have voluntarily placed over Symbiq General infusion pumps on ship hold for a new U.S. customers but will continue to service our existing customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have seen an uptick in activity related to our device products. This is due in part to the normal inspection cycle of our device plants, but is also due to the progression of our comprehensive device review. If you recall, we've been updating you every quarter on the status of that review, which has recently advanced the point where we are beginning to identify root cause and the necessary areas of remediation. While we anticipate this may lead to additional recalls and field activity as it did in our pharma operations, we take this as a sign of progress, not regression. As I repeatedly said, I want the organization to identify and surface issues, drive the root cause and then fix the issues. This is the only way to put these quality matters behind us. And this is important to do because our customers and patients around the world depend on our pumps on a daily basis. Our highly sophisticated devices bring value to our customers to reducing medication errors and, more recently, with the increased patient safety and enhanced workflow that IVCI enables. 
We are in discussion with CD-RH, the device side of the FDA, as we are trying to build the same level of open communication and cooperation we have established with the pharma side based on our extensive interactions over recent months. Our commitment to product quality and manufacturing compliance equally applies to our Medication Management business, and we are in the midst of dialogue with the agency to outline our current remediation plans and to better understand their expectations. We believe this increased interaction with the agency will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our pharma and device quality and manufacturing footprint. 
Moving to growth. I want to highlight for you some of the continued progress we have made on our pipeline and growth initiatives. Under our global expansion program, through the end of the quarter, we filed approximately 35 new to country submissions and are on track to exceed the target we previously announced of 50 new to country submissions by the end of the year. We completed the renewal of several major GPO pharma contracts, which overall have been neutral to positive from a sales perspective. We raise prices on certain drugs where we had significant market positions and loss volume on a limited number of products. These contracts became effective at various point during the third and fourth quarters. 
We announced during the quarter an agreement to acquire from local pharmaceuticals, a manufacturing facility that produces active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, together with an associated research and development facility. Once completed, the acquisition will enable us to vertically integrate APIs into certain critical data lockdown antibiotics. It is also expected to improve our cost position and ensure supply in this important therapeutic space. 
Finally, we also entered into an agreement with Mochida Pharmaceuticals to distribute and co-promote our generic oncology products in Japan. The combination of Hospira's global leadership in the generic injectable market with Mochida's brand is one of the Japan's most trusted pharmaceutical companies create a strong new partnership to improve access to high-quality, lower-cost therapies for Japanese cancer patients. 
Turning now to our sales results for the quarter. All references to net sales results are on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
Net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by strong volumes in certain specialty injectable products both in the U.S. and across EMEA, as well as higher device sales. By product line, global specialty injectable net sales increased 5% for the quarter. Strong SIP performance in both the Americas and EMEA were offset by softer results in our APAC region. 
Let we now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable net sales were up 4% for the third quarter. The increase related primarily to 2 factors. First, Precedex. Precedex had another great quarter driven by continued strong demand for the product. And second, oxaliplatin. We successfully relaunched oxaliplatin in the U.S. in August as planned. Despite a fairly crowded market in a significant price erosion of over 90%, we were able to gain a strong position of over 30% market share. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 14% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were, which has gained significant momentum and is now our top-selling generic product in the region. And our biosimilars, and Nivestim, which continued to perform well. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 1% in the quarter. Strength in our biosimilar Nivestim in Australia was offset by the timing of Precedex deliveries in Japan. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 1% during the third quarter due to continued momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps. 
Sales in our Other Pharma product line were up 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased demand and a higher release of product in our contract manufacturing business to various customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,222596244,380210,"Hospira Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2012",2012-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. As Mike mentioned, on a global basis, net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of l",614,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. As Mike mentioned, on a global basis, net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of last year. This primarily due to cost associated with strengthening our quality systems, as well as lower manufacturing volumes. R&D expense decreased 5% in the third quarter to $66 million. This is a result of the timing of spending on clinical trials. As a percentage of net sales, R&D was 6.7% compared to 7.1% in the third quarter last year. SG&A expense for the third quarter was $155 million, up 4% from $150 million in the third quarter last year. The increase here is associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as higher costs for information technology. 
Adjusted operating income was $113 million. This compares to $142 million in the third quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 15% in last year's third quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 17% in the third quarter last year. And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.66 in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $404 million compared to $277 million in the 9-month period last year. This, despite lower net income, our improved management of inventories and receivables, as well as a timing of some cash disbursements drove this year-over-year improvements. 
Capital spending for the first 9 months of this year was $202 million, down just slightly compared with $211 million for the same period last year. The largest portion of capital spend for the 9 months this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at the greenfield plant we're building in Vizag, India. Our cash balance at September 30 was $841 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Next, turning to guidance. We are maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant currency basis with foreign exchange expected to contribute a negative 1% to negative 2%. For adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that we'll be at approximately $2 per share. We're maintaining all other income statement guidance for the full year of 2012. 
For cash flow, we now expect cash flow from operations to come in at the lower end of our previous -- previously communicated range should be between $475 million and $500 million, and capital expenditures will be between $325 million and $350 million. The lowering here a result of the timing of projects pending. 
Next, regarding the remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million that we've previously provided for both pharma and device remediation. On our second quarter earnings call, we indicated that based on our estimates at that time, we would come in toward the upper end of that range. Now we've already incurred charges of over $300 million to date since we set that range. We now estimate we'll be above the upper end of that range. We're working to solidify projections on some of the project and remediated -- and remediation-related costs, particularly with respect to devices, so as to be able to provide more clarity on our future projected cost. Outside of the cost we just discussed, these remediation activities are continuing to have a significant impact on our ongoing operations, putting pressure on our gross margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

While we're committed to keeping you fully informed regarding our remediation activity, I am looking forward to the day I spend most of the call talking about our growth and strategic initiatives. Remember that at the end of the day, the efforts and investments that we are making will pay off and we will be in an even greater competitive position in our industry. And while our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive than we originally thought and will take more time and money to complete, they are the right thing to do for Hospira, for our customers and the patients they serve, and ultimately, for all of our stakeholders. 
With all of the remediation activity, it's easy to lose sight of our powerful fundamentals and exciting prospects. Let me remind you, we currently supply more than 200 generic injectable drugs to the market. We have 1/3 of the market share in the U.S., giving us the leading market share position. And we have an installed base of over 0.5 million drug delivery pumps playing a critical role in sustaining our health deal system. We are investing in global expansion and bringing our broad portfolio of drugs to the global markets. 
We are a leader in the biosimilar market We already have 2 biosimilars on market in Europe, one in Australia, another one in registration in Europe and one in Phase III clinical trials in the U.S. paving the way as a market leader for entry into the U.S. and into the market forms. We are modernizing our existing facilities and building a new state-of-the-art plant, which is expected to significantly boost our production capacity and lower our costs. 
In sum, we are working hard through the issues we face today while remaining focus on driving growth. We believe the barriers to entry are increasing both in pharma and device, and that we will be positioning Hospira through our quality and growth efforts to be an even stronger leader going forward. 
With that, operator, we are ready for questions."

And as we go through the inspections and have an opportunity to discuss the inspections with them and again have this continued interaction, I feel like we are gaining the trust and credibility with the agency as we move forward. So I'm actually very pleased with the interaction with Cedar and the districts. So I'll address Austin know, because that was at the tail end of your question there. So with respect to Austin then, when we actually looked at the 483 and its observations, we believe that if the FDA had looked at the observations from the prior 483 and also had reviewed the commitments only, we would have a very different outcome there. When you look at the 483, it's focused on very different things than the original 483 was. And when we talk to the district, in fact, this is prior to the inspection, we made the point that we've lived up to our commitments but there were still work to do. And I think what this 483 confirms is that's exactly right. Now with respect to that 483, my sense of it is these issues are entirely manageable. We have put a response back into the agency, and I feel very good that we will be able to live up to the commitments we have made in this next response. And I also feel good that the agency went in with a very extensive 4-week, 4-inspector, national expert review of the plant. So from my standpoint, we're making good progress."

But as you look at the margins in the third and fourth quarter, they're always impacted about 100 basis points negatively by the shutdowns that occurred right around 4th of July and then over the Christmas, New Year's holidays, sometimes into the new part of the year, so about 100 basis points there. The other things that affected margins in the quarter obviously the shutdown was something we planned and factored in. But our inventory losses in the quarter, as well as failure to supply penalties, all related back to the quality issues and the supply issues impacted the margins as well, roughly about 125 basis points. So hopefully, that won't continue on and on. Again, in the fourth quarter, we have another set of shutdowns and the inventory losses and the failure to supply those were always things that are pretty difficult to call ahead of time, but those were the main factors."

Obviously, there's a lot of people looking for greater transactions out there. But what we need to do is stay focused at the game on hand right now and work through these remediation while preparing for the future, so I see a great feature."

As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales result",2109,"Thanks, Karen. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales results, which, like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations. Tom will provide a deeper dive into the financials, and I will wrap up with closing comments. 
As you are aware, we have been providing a list every quarter of current FDA inspections and the significant interactions between Hospira and the FDA. Due to the number of plants we operate, the FDA and other regulatory agencies are in our plants on a regular basis. However, the frequency of FDA inspections and interactions increased in the third quarter, including an uptick of activity on our device operations. 
As we've said in the past, we support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will ensure that we are aligned and that our remediation efforts meet their expectations. Eventually, we expect the heightened quality systems and processes that we are implementing to be a competitive advantage. 
As I mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive and taking more time than we originally thought. And as we know now, they are costing more. But the results we're seeing underscore our belief that we are making progress with our pharma remediation. We are engaging more deeply and frequently with the agency. We are meeting with every district in which we have a major manufacturing facility in a very open and constructive manner, which we view is a positive, and we believe we are meeting the commitments we outlined to the agency in our various plant action plans. 
Let me highlight for you some of the progress we're making at Rocky Mount. First, the plant. Over the past couple of quarters, we made significant investments in capital improvements and facility modifications. For example, we have started building our new state-of-the-art quality control lab and have installed our first automated visual inspection machine in Rocky, which is currently being qualified. When you consider the volume of product involved, these improvements and others should have a meaningful impact over the long term in helping us produce high-quality products in a cost-efficient manner. 
Second, people. As planned, we have significantly decreased the number of consultants at the facility as they transition from frontline production activities toward more oversight and verification of our manufacturing and remediation activities. These consultants are being replaced with our own newly-hired and fully trained frontline employee operators and quality personnel to ensure that the training improvements we have in place are integrated and sustained. 
Third, process and technology. We are implementing information technology solutions to help us enhance our quality systems, from systems that manage batch documentation release to systems that track the training and qualifications of our employees. All of these changes are helping improve the robustness of our manufacturing practices, which should result in better first-pass quality, more stable production and eventually, lower waste and overall cost. 
And finally, in production and release levels, our investments are yielding improvements. Our production and release levels are moving in the right direction as we continue with our plan to modestly increase our production levels through the end of the year in an effort to improve the supply of market-critical drugs. However, if increasing our production destabilizes the plant or adversely impacts our remediation efforts, we will adjust our production to release levels as necessary to sustain compliance. 
As we have said previously, we believe the next key milestone at Rocky Mount will be the FDA inspection of the facility. We are working diligently to ensure that we are fulfilling the commitments we outlined in our action plan and that we are fully meeting the expectations of the agency. 
Moving to Clayton. During the third quarter, we manufactured a limited amount of propofol. Based on reaching certain milestones, we plan on manufacturing and building inventory levels through the remainder of the year. We want to have an adequate supply of product prior to our reentry into the market, which we ultimately expect to be late this year or early next year. 
Regarding other facility inspection developments at Austin. We indicated we were inspected during the quarter and received a 483 with 19 observations. We have provided the FDA with a full response and set of commitments to address the 483 observations and are moving forward with our remediation efforts. 
At IKKT, our Hospira India anti-infective facility. The FDA performed an inspection of the plant, which resulted in a 483 with 5 observations. As a result of the observations, we made the decision to voluntarily stop production last month to expeditiously address certain observations related to aseptic practices and to put our operators through an extensive retraining and certification process. We have recently resumed producing and expect to be fully operational in the next few weeks. 
At McPherson. The FDA performed a full cGMP inspection. The inspection was recently completed and we received a 483 with 2 observations. The results of the inspection help confirm our belief that our remediation is largely on track. 
At our joint venture in India. The FDA performed an inspection with the facility, which resulted in 0 observations. 
Turning now to devices. At Costa Rica, as we disclosed, the FDA issued a Warning Letter in August on the facility following an inspection in April. We have provided the FDA with a response, which we believe fully address all of the matters cited in the Warning Letter. 
At Lake Forest, where the FDA inspected the device design controls and compliant [ph] system. If you recall, we received a 483 with 10 observations at the beginning of the third quarter. We have since submitted our action plan to the agency and remain on target to complete the commitments identified in the action plan. Last week, we received from the FDA what is referred to as an Untitled Letter. The letter indicates that the agency was not satisfied with the corrective actions we outlined to resolve 2 of the observations in the Form 483. We are working on a response to the agency to address their concerns. 
Regarding additional device developments. Last week, we initiated a voluntary recall with respect to our Symbiq pumps, which was classified by the FDA as a Class 1 recall. This action is due to the device's LCD touchscreens that may occasionally not respond in the intended manner. The FDA is not requiring us to remove any Symbiq pumps from the field. We are in the process of sending a second field notification letter to our customers reiterating the appropriate steps to take with regard to this issue. While we anticipate that the major cause of the issue will be addressed with a software update, we are working to finalize an appropriate solution. In the interim, as we work through this issue with the agency, we have voluntarily placed our Symbiq general infusion pumps on ship hold for new U.S. customers, but will continue to service our existing customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have seen an uptick in activity related to our device products. This is due in part to the normal inspection cycle of our device plants, but is also due to the progression of our comprehensive device review. If you recall, we've been updating you every quarter on the status of that review, which has recently advanced the point where we are beginning to identify root cause and the necessary areas of remediation. While we anticipate this may lead to additional recalls and field activity, as it did in our pharma operations, we take this as a sign of progress, not regression. As I repeatedly said, I want the organization to identify and surface issues, drive to root cause and then fix the issues. This is the only way to put these quality matters behind us. And this is important to do because our customers and patients around the world depend on our pumps on a daily basis. Our highly sophisticated devices bring value to our customers through reducing medication errors and, more recently, with the increased safe -- patient safety and enhanced workflow that IVCI enables.
We are in discussion with CDRH, the device side of the FDA, as we are trying to build the same level of open communication and cooperation we have established with the pharma side based on our extensive interactions over recent months. Our commitment to product quality and manufacturing compliance equally applies to our Medication Management business, and we are in the midst of dialogue with the agency to outline our current remediation plans and to better understand their expectations. We believe this increased interaction with the agency will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our pharma and device quality and manufacturing footprint. 
Moving to growth. I want to highlight for you some of the continued progress we have made on our pipeline and growth initiatives. Under our global expansion program, through the end of the quarter, we filed approximately 35 new-to-country submissions and are on track to exceed the target we previously announced of 50 new-to-country submissions by the end of the year. We completed the renewal of several major GPO pharma contracts, which overall have been neutral to positive from a sales perspective. We raised prices on certain drugs where we have significant market positions and loss [ph] volume on a limited number of products. These contracts became effective at various points during the third and fourth quarters. 
We announced during the quarter an agreement to acquire from Orchid Pharmaceuticals a manufacturing facility that produces active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, together with an associated research and development facility. Once completed, the acquisition will enable us to vertically integrate APIs into certain critical beta-lactam antibiotics. It is also expected to improve our cost position and ensure supply in this important therapeutic space. 
Finally, we also entered into an agreement with Mochida Pharmaceuticals to distribute and co-promote our generic oncology products in Japan. The combination of Hospira's global leadership in the generic injectable market with Mochida's brand as one of the Japan's most trusted pharmaceutical companies creates a strong new partnership to improve access to high-quality, lower-cost therapies for Japanese cancer patients. 
Turning now to our sales results for the quarter. All references to net sales results are on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
Net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by strong volumes in certain specialty injectable products both in the U.S. and across EMEA, as well as higher device sales. 
By product line, global specialty injectable net sales increased 5% for the quarter. Strong SIP performance in both the Americas and EMEA were offset by softer results in our APAC region. 
Let we now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable net sales were up 4% for the third quarter. The increase relate to primarily to 2 factors. First, Precedex. Precedex had another great quarter, driven by continued strong demand for the product. And second, oxaliplatin. We successfully relaunched oxaliplatin in the U.S. in August as planned. Despite a fairly crowded market and a significant price erosion of over 90%, we were able to gain a strong position of over 30% market share. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 14% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were meropenem, which has gained significant momentum and is now our top-selling generic product in the region, and our biosimilars, Retacrit and Nivestim, which continued to perform well. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 1% in the quarter. Strength in our biosimilar Nivestim in Australia was offset by the timing of Precedex deliveries in Japan. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 1% during the third quarter due to continued momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps. 
Sales in our Other Pharma product line were up 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased demand and a higher release of product in our contract manufacturing business to various customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"
9681063,222596244,380408,"Hospira Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2012",2012-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Hospira Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. As Mike mentioned, on a global basis, net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of l",613,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. As Mike mentioned, on a global basis, net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of last year. This primarily due to costs associated with strengthening our quality systems, as well as lower manufacturing volumes. 
R&D expense decreased 5% in the third quarter to $66 million. This is a result of the timing of spending on clinical trials. As a percentage of net sales, R&D was 6.7% compared to 7.1% in the third quarter last year. 
SG&A expense for the third quarter was $155 million, up 4% from $150 million in the third quarter last year. The increase here is associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as higher costs for information technology. 
Adjusted operating income was $113 million. This compares to $142 million in the third quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 15% in last year's third quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 17% in the third quarter last year. And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.66 in the third quarter last year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $404 million compared to $277 million in the 9-month period last year. This, despite lower net income, our improved management of inventories and receivables, as well as the timing of some cash disbursements, drove these year-over-year improvements. 
Capital spending for the first 9 months of this year was $202 million, down just slightly compared with $211 million for the same period last year. The largest portion of capital spend for the 9 months this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at the greenfield plant we're building in Vizag, India. 
Our cash balance at September 30 was $841 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Next, turning to guidance. We are maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant currency basis with foreign exchange expected to contribute a negative 1% to negative 2%. For adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that we'll be at approximately $2 per share. We're maintaining all other income statement guidance for the full year of 2012. 
For cash flow, we now expect cash flow from operations to come in at the lower end of our previous -- previously communicated range, should be between $475 million and $500 million, and capital expenditures will be between $325 million and $350 million. The lowering here, a result of the timing of projects spending. 
Next, regarding the remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million that we've previously provided for both pharma and device remediation. On our second quarter earnings call, we indicated that based on our estimates at the time, we would come in toward the upper end of that range. Now we've already incurred charges of over $300 million to date since we set that range. We now estimate we'll be above the upper end of that range. We're working to solidify projections on some of the project and remediated -- and remediation-related costs, particularly with respect to devices, so as to be able to provide more clarity on our future projected costs. Outside of the costs we just discussed, these remediation activities are continuing to have a significant impact on our ongoing operations, putting pressure on our gross margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

While we're committed to keeping you fully informed regarding our remediation activity, I am looking forward to the day I spend most of the call talking about our growth and strategic initiatives. Remember that at the end of the day, the efforts and investments that we are making will pay off and we will be in an even greater competitive position in our industry. And while our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive than we originally thought and will take more time and money to complete, they are the right thing to do for Hospira, for our customers and the patients they serve and ultimately, for all of our stakeholders. 
With all of the remediation activity, it's easy to lose sight of our powerful fundamentals and exciting prospects. Let me remind you, we currently supply more than 200 generic injectable drugs to the market. We have 1/3 of the market share in the U.S., giving us the leading market share position. And we have an installed base of over 0.5 million drug delivery pumps playing a critical role in sustaining our health care system. 
We are investing in global expansion and bringing our broad portfolio of drugs to the global markets. 
We are a leader in the biosimilar market. We already have 2 biosimilars on market in Europe, 1 in Australia, another 1 in registration in Europe and 1 in Phase III clinical trials in the U.S., paving the way as a market leader for entry into the U.S. when [ph] into the market forms. 
We are modernizing our existing facilities and building a new state-of-the-art plant, which is expected to significantly boost our production capacity and lower our costs. 
In sum, we are working hard through the issues we face today while remaining focused on driving growth. We believe the barriers to entry are increasing both in pharma and device, and that we will be positioning Hospira through our quality and growth efforts to be an even stronger leader going forward. 
With that, operator, we are ready for questions."

When you look at the 483, it's focused on very different things than the original 483 was. And when we talk to the district, in fact, this was prior to the inspection, we made the point that we've lived up to our commitments, but there was still work to do. And I think what this 483 confirms is, that's exactly right. Now with respect to that 483, my sense of it is these issues are entirely manageable. We have put a response back into the agency, and I feel very good that we will be able to live up to the commitments we've made in this next response.

The other things that affected margins in the quarter, obviously, the shutdown was something we planned and factored in. But our inventory losses in the quarter, as well as failure to supply penalties, all related back to the quality issues and the supply issues impacted the margins as well, roughly about 125 basis points. So hopefully, that won't continue on and on. Again, in the fourth quarter, we'll have another set of shutdowns and the inventory losses and the failure to supply, those were always things that are pretty difficult to call ahead of time, but those were the main factors."

As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales result",2108,"Thanks, Karen. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. As has been our practice this year, I'll start with an update on our quality improvement efforts, talk a bit about our growth expansion plans and then discuss our third quarter sales results which, like our adjusted EPS, were in line with our expectations. Tom will provide a deeper dive into the financials, and I will wrap up with closing comments. 
As you are aware, we have been providing a list every quarter of current FDA inspections and the significant interactions between Hospira and the FDA. Due to the number of plants we operate, the FDA and other regulatory agencies are in our plants on a regular basis. However, the frequency of FDA inspections and interactions increased in the third quarter, including an uptick of activity on our device operations. 
As we've said in the past, we support this ongoing interaction with the agency as we believe it will ensure that we are aligned and that our remediation efforts meet their expectations. Eventually, we expect the heightened quality systems and processes that we are implementing to be a competitive advantage. 
As I mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive and taking more time than we originally thought. And as we know now, they are costing more. But the results we're seeing underscore our belief that we are making progress with our pharma remediation. We are engaging more deeply and frequently with the agency. We are meeting with every district in which we have a major manufacturing facility in a very open and constructive manner which we view is a positive, and we believe we are meeting the commitments we outlined to the agency in our various plant action plans. 
Let me highlight for you some of the progress we're making at Rocky Mount. First, the plant. Over the past couple of quarters, we made significant investments in capital improvements and facility modifications. For example, we have started building our new state-of-the-art quality control lab and have installed our first automated visual inspection machine in Rocky, which is currently being qualified. When you consider the volume of product involved, these improvements and others should have a meaningful impact over the long term in helping us produce high-quality products in a cost-efficient manner. 
Second, people. As planned, we have significantly decreased the number of consultants at the facility as they transition from frontline production activities toward more oversight and verification of our manufacturing and remediation activities. These consultants are being replaced with our own newly-hired and fully trained frontline employee operators and quality personnel to ensure that the training improvements we have in place are integrated and sustained. 
Third, process and technology. We are implementing information technology solutions to help us enhance our quality systems, from systems that manage batch documentation release to systems that track the training and qualifications of our employees. All of these changes are helping improve the robustness of our manufacturing practices, which should result in better first-pass quality, more stable production and eventually, lower waste and overall cost. 
And finally in production and release levels, our investments are yielding improvements. Our production and release levels are moving in the right direction as we continue with our plan to modestly increase our production levels through the end of the year in an effort to improve the supply of market-critical drugs. However, if increasing our production destabilizes the plant or adversely impacts our remediation efforts, we will adjust our production to release levels as necessary to sustain compliance. 
As we have said previously, we believe the next key milestone at Rocky Mount will be the FDA inspection of the facility. We are working diligently to ensure that we are fulfilling the commitments we outlined in our action plan and that we are fully meeting the expectations of the agency. 
Moving to Clayton. During the third quarter, we manufactured a limited amount of propofol. Based on reaching certain milestones, we plan on manufacturing and building inventory levels through the remainder of the year. We want to have an adequate supply of product prior to our reentry into the market, which we ultimately expect to be late this year or early next year. 
Regarding other facility inspection developments at Austin. We indicated we were inspected during the quarter and received a 483 with 19 observations. We have provided the FDA with a full response and set of commitments to address the 483 observations and are moving forward with our remediation efforts. 
At IKKT, our Hospira India anti-infective facility. The FDA performed an inspection of the plant, which resulted in a 483 with 5 observations. As a result of the observations, we made the decision to voluntarily stop production last month to expeditiously address certain observations related to aseptic practices and to put our operators through an extensive retraining and certification process. We have recently resumed producing and expect to be fully operational in the next few weeks. 
At McPherson. The FDA performed a full cGMP inspection. The inspection was recently completed and we received a 483 with 2 observations. The results of the inspection help confirm our belief that our remediation is largely on track. 
At our joint venture in India, the FDA performed an inspection with the facility which resulted in 0 observations. 
Turning now to devices. At Costa Rica, as we disclosed, the FDA issued a Warning Letter in August on the facility following an inspection in April. We have provided the FDA with a response, which we believe fully address all of the matters cited in the Warning Letter. 
At Lake Forest, where the FDA inspected the device design controls and complaint system.  If you recall, we received a 483 with 10 observations at the beginning of the third quarter. We have since submitted our action plan to the agency and remain on target to complete the commitments identified in the action plan. Last week, we received from the FDA what is referred to as an Untitled Letter. The letter indicates that the agency was not satisfied with the corrective actions we outlined to resolve 2 of the observations in the Form 483. We are working on a response to the agency to address their concerns. 
Regarding additional device developments. Last week, we initiated a voluntary recall with respect to our Symbiq pumps, which was classified by the FDA as a Class 1 recall. This action is due to the device's LCD touchscreens that may occasionally not respond in the intended manner. The FDA is not requiring us to remove any Symbiq pumps from the field. We are in the process of sending a second field notification letter to our customers reiterating the appropriate steps to take with regard to this issue. While we anticipate that the major cause of the issue will be addressed with a software update, we are working to finalize an appropriate solution. In the interim, as we work through this issue with the agency, we have voluntarily placed our Symbiq general infusion pumps on ship hold for new U.S. customers, but will continue to service our existing customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have seen an uptick in activity related to our device products. This is due in part to the normal inspection cycle of our device plants, but is also due to the progression of our comprehensive device review. If you recall, we've been updating you every quarter on the status of that review, which has recently advanced the point where we are beginning to identify root cause and the necessary areas of remediation. While we anticipate this may lead to additional recalls and field activity, as it did in our pharma operations, we take this as a sign of progress, not regression. As I repeatedly said, I want the organization to identify and surface issues, drive to root cause and then fix the issues. This is the only way to put these quality matters behind us. And this is important to do because our customers and patients around the world depend on our pumps on a daily basis. Our highly sophisticated devices bring value to our customers through reducing medication errors and, more recently, with the increased safe -- patient safety and enhanced workflow that IVCI enables.
We are in discussion with CDRH, the device side of the FDA, as we are trying to build the same level of open communication and cooperation we have established with the pharma side based on our extensive interactions over recent months. Our commitment to product quality and manufacturing compliance equally applies to our Medication Management business, and we are in the midst of dialogue with the agency to outline our current remediation plans and to better understand their expectations. We believe this increased interaction with the agency will not only help ensure that our remediation efforts meet their expectations, but it also supports the holistic improvement initiatives we're committed to making across our pharma and device quality and manufacturing footprint. 
Moving to growth. I want to highlight for you some of the continued progress we have made on our pipeline and growth initiatives. Under our global expansion program, through the end of the quarter, we filed approximately 35 new-to-country submissions and are on track to exceed the target we previously announced of 50 new-to-country submissions by the end of the year. We completed the renewal of several major GPO pharma contracts, which overall have been neutral to positive from a sales perspective. We raised prices on certain drugs where we have significant market positions and lost [ph] volume on a limited number of products. These contracts became effective at various points during the third and fourth quarters. 
We announced during the quarter an agreement to acquire from Orchid Pharmaceuticals a manufacturing facility that produces active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, together with an associated research and development facility. Once completed, the acquisition will enable us to vertically integrate APIs into certain critical beta-lactam antibiotics. It is also expected to improve our cost position and ensure supply in this important therapeutic space. 
Finally, we also entered into an agreement with Mochida Pharmaceuticals to distribute and co-promote our generic oncology products in Japan. The combination of Hospira's global leadership in the generic injectable market with Mochida's brand as one of the Japan's most trusted pharmaceutical companies creates a strong new partnership to improve access to high-quality, lower-cost therapies for Japanese cancer patients. 
Turning now to our sales results for the quarter. All references to net sales results are on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our press release provides full details on the impact of foreign currency on net sales by segment and product line. 
Net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by strong volumes in certain specialty injectable products both in the U.S. and across EMEA, as well as higher device sales. 
By product line, global specialty injectable net sales increased 5% for the quarter. Strong SIP performance in both the Americas and EMEA were offset by softer results in our APAC region. 
Let we now discuss performance by region. In the Americas, specialty injectable net sales were up 4% for the third quarter. The increase related to primarily to 2 factors. First, Precedex. Precedex had another great quarter, driven by continued strong demand for the product. And second, oxaliplatin. We successfully relaunched oxaliplatin in the U.S. in August as planned. Despite a fairly crowded market and a significant price erosion of over 90%, we were able to gain a strong position of over 30% market share. 
Turning now to the EMEA segment. Net sales of specialty injectables were up 14% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Highlights during the quarter were meropenem, which has gained significant momentum and is now our top-selling generic product in the region, and our biosimilars, Retacrit and Nivestim, which continued to perform well. 
In APAC, net sales of specialty injectables decreased 1% in the quarter. Strength in our biosimilar Nivestim in Australia was offset by the timing of Precedex deliveries in Japan. 
Turning now to Medication Management. Global net sales increased 1% during the third quarter due to continued momentum in customer demand for our smart infusion pumps. 
Sales in our Other Pharma product line were up 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased demand and a higher release of product in our contract manufacturing business to various customers. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for an overview of our financial results. Tom?"

Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of l",613,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. As Mike mentioned, on a global basis, net sales were up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was 34%, down from 37% in the third quarter of last year. This primarily due to costs associated with strengthening our quality systems, as well as lower manufacturing volumes. 
R&D expense decreased 5% in the third quarter to $66 million. This is a result of the timing of spending on clinical trials. As a percentage of net sales, R&D was 6.7% compared to 7.1% in the third quarter last year. 
SG&A expense for the third quarter was $155 million, up 4% from $150 million in the third quarter last year. The increase here is associated with increased selling and promotional expenses, as well as higher costs for information technology. 
Adjusted operating income was $113 million. This compares to $142 million in the third quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin was 11% compared to 15% in last year's third quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19% versus 17% in the third quarter last year. And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.66 in the third quarter last year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the 9 months ended September 30 was $404 million compared to $277 million in the 9-month period last year. This, despite lower net income, our improved management of inventories and receivables, as well as the timing of some cash disbursements, drove these year-over-year improvements. 
Capital spending for the first 9 months of this year was $202 million, down just slightly compared with $211 million for the same period last year. The largest portion of capital spend for the 9 months this year reflects investments we're making relative to our capacity expansion efforts, primarily at the greenfield plant we're building in Vizag, India. 
Our cash balance at September 30 was $841 million, up from $598 million at the end of last year. 
Next, turning to guidance. We are maintaining our net sales guidance of down 1% to up 2% on a constant currency basis with foreign exchange expected to contribute a negative 1% to negative 2%. For adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that we'll be at approximately $2 per share. We're maintaining all other income statement guidance for the full year of 2012. 
For cash flow, we now expect cash flow from operations to come in at the lower end of our previous -- previously communicated range, should be between $475 million and $500 million, and capital expenditures will be between $325 million and $350 million. The lowering here a result of the timing of projects spending. 
Next, regarding the remediation cost range of $300 million to $375 million that we've previously provided for both pharma and device remediation. On our second quarter earnings call, we indicated that based on our estimates at the time, we would come in toward the upper end of that range. Now we've already incurred charges of over $300 million to date since we set that range. We now estimate we'll be above the upper end of that range. We're working to solidify projections on some of the project and remediated -- and remediation-related costs, particularly with respect to devices, so as to be able to provide more clarity on our future projected costs. Outside of the costs we just discussed, these remediation activities are continuing to have a significant impact on our ongoing operations, putting pressure on our gross margins. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for some final comments."

While we're committed to keeping you fully informed regarding our remediation activity, I am looking forward to the day I spend most of the call talking about our growth and strategic initiatives. Remember that at the end of the day, the efforts and investments that we are making will pay off and we will be in an even greater competitive position in our industry. And while our overall quality initiatives are proving more extensive than we originally thought and will take more time and money to complete, they are the right thing to do for Hospira, for our customers and the patients they serve and ultimately, for all of our stakeholders. 
With all of the remediation activity, it's easy to lose sight of our powerful fundamentals and exciting prospects. Let me remind you, we currently supply more than 200 generic injectable drugs to the market. We have 1/3 of the market share in the U.S., giving us the leading market share position. And we have an installed base of over 0.5 million drug delivery pumps playing a critical role in sustaining our health care system. 
We are investing in global expansion and bringing our broad portfolio of drugs to the global markets. 
We are a leader in the biosimilar market. We already have 2 biosimilars on market in Europe, 1 in Australia, another 1 in registration in Europe and 1 in Phase III clinical trials in the U.S., paving the way as a market leader for entry into the U.S. when the market forms. 
We are modernizing our existing facilities and building a new state-of-the-art plant, which is expected to significantly boost our production capacity and lower our costs. 
In sum, we are working hard through the issues we face today while remaining focused on driving growth. We believe the barriers to entry are increasing both in pharma and device, and that we will be positioning Hospira through our quality and growth efforts to be an even stronger leader going forward. 
With that, operator, we are ready for questions."

So with respect to Austin then, when we actually look at the 483 and its observations, we believe that if the FDA had looked at the observations from the prior 483 and also had reviewed the commitments only, we would’ve had a very different outcome there. When you look at the 483, it's focused on very different things than the original 483 was. And when we talk to the district, in fact this was prior to the inspection, we made the point that we've lived up to our commitments, but there was still work to do. And I think what this 483 confirms is, that's exactly right. Now with respect to that 483, my sense of it is these issues are entirely manageable. We have put a response back into the agency, and I feel very good that we will be able to live up to the commitments we've made in this next response. And I also feel good that the agency went in with a very extensive 4-week, 4-inspector, national expert review of the plant. So from my standpoint, we're making good progress."

If I look at the 33.6% number you put up in Q3, how much of that was impacted by the standard plant shutdowns that occurred in the third quarter? Because your guidance obviously has gross margins in the second half, but lower than they were on the first half. So as we think about the moving parts around that line item, can you maybe just walk us through the pivot points up and down on the gross margin line going forward?"

Overall, the earnings were fine as we got through the rest of the income statement. But as you look at the margins in the third and fourth quarter, they're always impacted about 100 basis points negatively by the shutdowns that occur right around 4th of July and then over the Christmas, New Year's holidays, sometimes into the new part of the year, so about 100 basis points there. The other things that affected margins in the quarter, obviously the shutdown was something we planned and factored in. But our inventory losses in the quarter, as well as failure to supply penalties, all related back to the quality issues and the supply issues impacted the margins as well, roughly about 125 basis points. So hopefully, that won't continue on and on. Again, in the fourth quarter, we'll have another set of shutdowns and the inventory losses and the failure to supply, those are always things that are pretty difficult to call ahead of time, but those were the main factors."

We will see if there's any surprises at that particular juncture. As I said, we have the FDA, we believe will be in, in the first quarter or second quarter. Again, we will see where the FDA is at in terms of our remediation. So right now what I would say to you is, we will continue to make modest improvements. I think the FDA inspection will be a seminal event, which will tell us are we on the right track with respect to remediation and are we able to continue remediation and get the plant up close to normal levels? So I really look at the FDA inspection as being a major guidepost to us. However, just to be absolutely clear, it's not a necessary thing. In other words, we can ramp the plant up as we believe we should and are able to, but that FDA inspection will be critical in terms of telling us the path forward."
