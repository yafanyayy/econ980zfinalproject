With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Tim McLevish, our CFO. Now during today's remarks, we will make forward-looking statements. The statements are based on how we see things today, so actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings release and Form 10 filing for more details on our forward-looking statements. 
We'll also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and on the Investor Center page of kraftfoodsgroup.com. 
Before we start, I'd like to say a few words on the basis of our third quarter financial presentation contained in the press release issued earlier today and the 10-Q when it is filed. As we discussed at our Investor Day this past September, our third-quarter financials were developed on a carve-out basis, consistent with the Form 10 that we filed at the time of separation from what is now called Mondelez International. 
On a carve-out basis, I think you'll find that the net revenue is comparable on a year-over-year basis, and you can see that we delivered solid growth with positive pricing and fall mix gains, whether or not you choose to adjust for pruning or the building of safety stock with our retail customers that occurred ahead of our spinoff and related systems switch over. 
On the operating income line, beside from restructuring costs in 2012, operating income is largely comparable, given similar costs allocation methodologies. And on that basis, we delivered high-quality operating income dollar growth that was driven by productivity gains that funded a significant increase in advertising. 
Below the operating income line, however, year-over-year comparability is lacking, particularly in the areas of interest expense and taxes. And as we've discussed before, these carve-out financials are not fully reflective of our cost structure on a standalone basis going forward. 
So we felt that today's call would be most productive if we were to focus on our business health, the performance of our brand franchises and what to expect to see in our financial reporting going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tony Vernon to talk about our business health and the performance of our brand franchise."

Let me start by saying that judging by our actions and results in the third quarter, we believe we've laid a solid foundation for the future of our $19 billion start-up. 
By the numbers, we liked what we saw on both top and bottom lines. But as Chris explained, there are limitations in conclusions we can draw from the carve-out financials. So without going into convoluted pro forma discussions, here's what I see in our third-quarter results that excites me about the future of the new Kraft. 
First, as I said at our Investor Day, we're focused on profitable growth, with a marketing playbook based on advertising investments, top-tier innovation and good, better, best price value offerings in our key categories. 
Against those objectives, there were several highlights in the quarter. It was our first reporting period of positive pricing and positive bottlenecks in many quarters. In Cheese and Dairy, our team has now delivered 9 consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth and operating income growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters by following the playbook I just described. 
In Refrigerated Meals, Lunchables were up over 13% behind better for you innovations. And Oscar Mayer gold cuts continued strongly behind good, better, best offerings that deliver the right products at the right price points. 
Further, we're even invested in category leaders, great marketing and product innovation, continued to deliver outstanding growth. 
Just listen to these examples among many. Velveeta Dinners, up 20%; MiO, up 49%; Philly Cream Cheese, Kool-Aid Jammers and Cool Whip all showed strong volume and share gains; and Tassimo in Canada nearly doubled from the prior year. 
The second factor I'd highlight is it's all paid for, as we recover input cost and redefined efficiency. 
We are taking the key steps on our way to achieving low-cost producer status and lowest cost overheads. 
And third quarter continued our momentum in that productivity savings. We also continued to execute our pricing strategy by pricing to commodities, while managing through the expected elasticity impact. 
The quarter also demonstrated our intent to prove less profitable products, further driving efficiency and simplification in our business model. 
The third factor I'd highlight is our people and how well they performed through our transition to independence. On this front, I'd like to congratulate Tim McLevish and our project management office for getting us ready for an independent Kraft Foods. The task was a complex and significant undertaking. It touched every part of our organization, and all credits to our entire team for a flawless execution. It included several notable accomplishments, separating 2 sales forces and a large distribution and logistics infrastructure, outsourcing in-store merchandising, establishing an investment-grade capital structure, separating our Canada organization and moving our Beverages and Planters businesses as the units from the East Coast to the Midwest. 
Further, the team divided almost 100,000 trademarks, 10,000 contracts, 6,000 patents and 600 software applications. 
With all that going on during this time of great transition, we actually improved on many Operational metrics. For example, customer service levels went up, not down, during the transition. And through it all, our teams remained focused on delivering our annual budget commitments, and our numbers show it. But our work has just begun. We're taking the road less traveled as we create a renaissance in North American food and beverages. But we still have miles ago to deliver on the potential of the best brand portfolio in our industry. 
As I've told you before, we are positioning ourselves to meet significant challenges ahead. The economic environment has not improved, and that creates a burning platform for Kraft, our customers and our industry. That is, how to consistently grow volume. To achieve it, Kraft must raise advertising levels to competitive benchmarks, continue to drive our innovation advantage and establish good, better, best offerings in all of our key categories. 
More specifically, our Coffee business needs to improve its cost structure and to participate in all of its key segments. 
JELL-O must be revitalized, and we must do it in the face of yogurt's explosive growth. 
And Planters needs significantly more work to reestablish category leadership and profitable growth. And that's just to name a few of our bigger projects. 
To fuel all this, we must also become the low-cost producer on our many leadership brands, and we are only in the early innings of capturing the upside of our cost curve. 
Also, we have much work ahead to make cash king in the new Kraft. So we're building new muscles in integrating business planning, net productivity and disciplined cash management. 
We have made this complicated in the past. It really is about simplification in the new Kraft. We're out to create a robust, repeatable businesses system where all of our employees are aligned to drag drive steady, consistent shareholder return. 
Since I met with you last, we've launched our $19 billion start up, and we're making the investments in people and culture that I spoke to you about. 
Our Beverages and Planters businesses moved from the East Coast, and we are thrilled to have their talents here and soon under one roof. 
Our Northfield campus is taking on a totally new look and feel. We're knocking down walls to create an open and a vibrant workplace that will enable the collaboration and best practice that we weren't getting in our view of credit silos. 
Most importantly, we are walking the talk against our goals of being the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our industry, and we are populating the curriculum for our new Kraft University as we speak. 
Our employees are becoming increasingly energized by, and engaged in, being part of the new Kraft. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to my partner, Tim McLevish, to walk you through what to expect on the financial front as we move forward."

As Chris noted earlier, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect carve-out financials and other separation and carve-out related effects, which are not fully reflective of what you would expect on a standalone basis going forward. 
With that caveat, we were quite pleased with our underlying results in the quarter. Organic revenue growth of 3.2% includes 2.6 percentage points of pull forwards from customer inventory builds in preparation for the spin. This is partly offset, however, by 1.3 percentage points of extraordinary pruning, as we exit less profitable product lines. 
On an underlying basis, we outpaced market growth, despite only about 60 basis points of pricing. We also drove sizable improvement in our gross profit. While unrealized gains and commodity hedging positions contributed to the favorability, [indiscernible], pricing net of cost and solid productivity all contributed to the increase. 
SG&A was up considerably from last year, largely driven by an increase in advertising and consumer investments. The remaining increase was due to higher pension costs and some higher one-off costs versus the prior year. 
Absent these factors, our overhead cost were favorable on an underlying basis. In the end, no matter how you cut it, our results reflected solid mid-single-digit operating income growth, consistent with our long-term guidance. 
We delivered high-quality results on the top and the bottom line, we maintained operating momentum, all well executing an unprecedented corporate separation. This is no small task, and we are pleased with our results during this time of significant change. 
But as Tony said, there are still much to get through, and that goes for our reported financials as well. So let me help guide you through what you can expect to see from us in the coming months. I'll start with our Q4 expectations, which will continue to reflect several impacts from our transitions to an independent company. 
We still expect solid consumption growth in Q4, as a result of our investment in brand building and innovation. 
From a revenue perspective, however, we expect Q4 revenues will be flat to down due to 3 significant headwinds: First, we'll be comparing to high single digit organic growth in Q4 last year. This was enhanced by retailer purchases made in advance of announced price increases in our ready-to-drink beverage and Cheese businesses. 
Second, our customers will be working down the inventories built in Q3. 
And third, our product line pruning will temper revenue growth by 1.5 to 2 points in the quarter. 
At the profit line, several other factors, in addition, to the revenue of headwinds, will come into play. As we've discussed before, Q4 will be the first period to reflect our independent cost structure and transition to a standalone entity. 
We'll see a full quarter's worth of retiree benefit expenses, fully diluted overhead cost and interest expense reflective of our capital structure on a standalone basis. 
We'll also see higher restructuring cost as we accelerate restructuring activity, and I expect to incur somewhere in the range of $225 million of such costs in the quarter. 
As a result of having quite a few large moving pieces in a short 3-month window, we're not in a position to provide Q4 earnings guidance at this time. However, we still expect to deliver solid underlying profitable growth in 2012. 
And we continue to expect strong results in 2013, consistent with the guidance we've provided at our Investor Day in September. 
On the top line, we're targeting organic revenue growth that meets the rate of North American food and beverage market, despite a negative impact of 1 point due to 2 product pruning. 
We expect productivity improvement and overhead savings to drive 2013 EPS of approximately $2.60 on a GAAP basis. This outlook assumes interest expense of approximately $520 million, and an effective tax rate of 35%. 
The guidance for the year also includes restructuring cost of about $240 million or $0.26 per share. We'd still expect free cash flow to be about 70% of GAAP net income. And finally, we expect to recommend to our Board in December a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or an annual rate of about $2 per share, as previously indicated. 
I'll now turn it over to Tony for some closing remarks. Tony?"

But there seems to be 3 straightforward adjustments we can make. We can make an adjustment for the restructurings, the unrealized gains and losses on hedges and the trade load. And if you do that for both the third quarter of '12 and the third quarter of '11, I think we should be able to get to a number that's more or less pretty clean. When I make those adjustments, I get operating income that fill me up about $8 million or about 1%, and I would get revenues that are up just about 0.5%.

So those are sort of our stated pricing models and predicting what's going to happen in commodities or something that we've -- we, in the industry, approve, and we're not too good at it. How we manage it with our brands that I think is key. On Coffee, I love this question because we have so much work to do. But we have plans in place. Maxwell House today, and you guys give me this data, its margin is disadvantaged by several points, versus the other big guy, right, Folgers. And so, I always tell the brands, it's not where there are; it's where they start. We have a lot of low-cost methods, a lot of lean manufacturing going into that Maxwell House facility. We got one of our best lean 6 Sigma teams running it, and we see a lot of improvement that will allow us to reinvest in our brands and deliver value to the shareholders.

With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Tim McLevish, our CFO. Now during today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. These statements are based on how we see things today so actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings release and Form-10 filing for more details on our forward-looking statements. 
We'll also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and on the Investor Center page of kraftfoodsgroup.com. 
Before we start, I'd like to say a few words on the basis of our third quarter financial presentation contained in the press release issued earlier today and the 10-Q when it is filed. As we discussed at our Investor Day this past September, our third quarter financials were developed on a carve-out basis, consistent with the Form-10 that we filed at the time of separation from what is now called Mondelez International. 
On a carve-out basis, I think you'll find that the net revenue is comparable on a year-over-year basis, and you can see that we delivered solid growth with positive pricing and following mix gains, whether or not you choose to adjust for pruning or the building of safety stock with our retail customers that occurred ahead of our spinoff and related systems switchover. 
On the operating income line, beside from restructuring costs in 2012, operating income is largely comparable, given similar cost-allocation methodologies. And on that basis, we delivered high-quality operating income dollar growth that was driven by productivity gains that funded a significant increase in advertising. 
Below the operating income line, however, year-over-year comparability is lacking, particularly in the areas of interest expense and taxes. And as we've discussed before, these carve-out financials are not fully reflective of our cost structure on a standalone basis going forward. 
So we felt that today's call would be most productive if we were to focus on our business health, the performance of our brand franchises and what to expect to see in our financial reporting going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tony Vernon to talk about our business health and the performance of our brand franchises."

Let me start by saying that judging by our actions and results in the third quarter, we believe we've laid a solid foundation for the future of our $19 billion start-up. 
By the numbers, we liked what we saw on both top and bottom lines. But as Chris explained, there are limitations in conclusions we can draw from the carve-out financials. So without getting into convoluted pro forma discussions, here's what I see in our third quarter results that excites me about the future of the new Kraft. 
First, as I said at our Investor Day, we're focused on profitable growth with a marketing playbook based on advertising investments, top-tier innovation and ""good, better, best"" price value offerings in our key categories. 
Against those objectives, there were several highlights in the quarter. It was our first reporting period of positive pricing and positive bottlenecks in many quarters. In cheese and dairy, our team has now delivered 9 consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth and operating income growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters by following the playbook I just described. 
In refrigerated meals, Lunchables were up over 13% behind better-for-you innovation. And Oscar Mayer cold cuts continued to grow strongly behind ""good, better, best"" offerings that deliver the right products at the right price points. 
Further, where we've invested as category leaders, great marketing and product innovation, continued to deliver outstanding growth. 
Just listen to these examples among many. Velveeta dinners, up 20%; MiO, up 49%; Philly cream cheese, Kool-Aid Jammers and Cool Whip all showed strong volume and share gains; and Tassimo in Canada nearly doubled from the prior year. 
The second factor I'd highlight is it's all paid for as we recover input costs and redefine efficiency. 
We are taking the key steps on our way to achieving low-cost producer status and lowest cost overheads. 
And third quarter continued our momentum in net productivity savings. We also continued to execute our pricing strategy by pricing to commodities, while managing through the expected elasticity impact. 
The quarter also demonstrated our intent to prune less profitable products, further driving efficiency and simplification in our business model. 
The third factor I'd highlight is our people and how well they performed through our transition to independence. On this front, I'd like to congratulate Tim McLevish and our project management office for getting us ready for an independent Kraft Foods. The task was a complex and significant undertaking. It touched every part of our organization, and all credits to our entire team for a flawless execution. It included several notable accomplishments, separating 2 sales forces and a large distribution and logistics infrastructure, outsourcing in-store merchandising, establishing an investment-grade capital structure, separating our Canada organization and moving our beverages and Planters businesses units from the East Coast to the Midwest. 
Further, the team divided almost 100,000 trademarks, 10,000 contracts, 6,000 patents and 600 software applications. 
With all that going on during this time of great transition, we actually improved on many Operational metrics. For example, customer service levels went up, not down, during the transition. And through it all, our teams remained focused on delivering our annual budget commitments, and our numbers show it. But our work has just begun. We are taking the road less traveled as we create a renaissance in North American food and beverages. But we still have miles ago to deliver on the potential of the best brand portfolio in our industry. 
As I've told you before, we are positioning ourselves to meet significant challenges ahead. The economic environment has not improved and that creates a burning platform for Kraft, our customers and our industry. That is how to consistently grow volume. To achieve it, Kraft must raise advertising levels to competitive benchmarks, continue to drive our innovation advantage and establish ""good, better, best"" offerings in all of our key categories. 
More specifically, our coffee business needs to improve its cost structure and to participate in all of its key segments. 
JELL-O must be revitalized, and we must do it in the face of yogurt's explosive growth. 
And Planters needs significantly more work to reestablish category leadership and profitable growth. And that's just to name a few of our bigger projects. 
To fuel all this, we must also become the low-cost producer on our many leadership brands, and we are only in the early innings of capturing the upside of our cost curve. 
Also, we have much work ahead to make cash king in the new Kraft. So we're building new muscles in integrated business planning, net productivity and disciplined cash management. 
We have made this complicated in the past. It really is about simplification in the new Kraft. We're out to create a robust, repeatable business system, where all of our employees are aligned to drive steady, consistent shareholder return. 
Since I met with you last, we've launched our $19 billion start-up, and we're making the investments in people and culture that I spoke to you about. 
Our beverages and Planters businesses moved from the East Coast, and we are thrilled to have their talents here and soon under one roof. 
Our Northfield campus is taking on a totally new look and feel. We're knocking down walls to create an open and a vibrant workplace that will enable the collaboration and best practice that we weren't getting in our bureaucratic silos. 
Most importantly, we are walking the talk against our goal of being the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our industry, and we are populating the curriculum for our new Kraft University as we speak. 
Our employees are becoming increasingly energized by and engaged in being part of the new Kraft. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to my partner, Tim McLevish, to walk you through what to expect on the financial front as we move forward."

As Chris noted earlier, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect carve-out financials and other separation and carve-out-related effects, which are not fully reflective of what you would expect on a standalone basis going forward. 
With that caveat, we were quite pleased with our underlying results in the quarter. Organic revenue growth of 3.2% includes 2.6 percentage points of pull forwards from customer inventory builds in preparation for the spin. This is partly offset, however, by 1.3 percentage points of extraordinary pruning, as we exit less profitable product lines. 
On an underlying basis, we outpaced market growth, despite only about 60 basis points of pricing. We also drove sizable improvement in our gross profit. While unrealized gains and commodity hedging positions contributed to the favorability, volume mix, pricing net of cost and solid productivity all contributed to the increase. 
SG&A was up considerably from last year, largely driven by an increase in advertising and consumer investments. The remaining increase was due to higher pension costs and some higher one-off costs versus the prior year. 
Absent these factors, our overhead costs were favorable on an underlying basis. In the end, no matter how you cut it, our results reflected solid mid-single-digit operating income growth, consistent with our long-term guidance. 
We delivered high-quality results on the top and the bottom line. We maintained operating momentum, all well executing an unprecedented corporate separation. This is no small task and we are pleased with our results during this time of significant change. 
But as Tony said, there are still much to get through and that goes for our reported financials as well. So let me help guide you through what you can expect to see from us in the coming months. I'll start with our Q4 expectations, which will continue to reflect several impacts from our transition to an independent company. 
We still expect solid consumption growth in Q4 as a result of our investment in brand building and innovation. 
From a revenue perspective, however, we expect Q4 revenues will be flat to down due to 3 significant headwinds. First, we'll be comparing to a high single-digit organic growth in Q4 last year. This was enhanced by retailer purchases made in advance of announced price increases in our ready-to-drink beverage and cheese businesses. 
Second, our customers will be working down the inventories built in Q3. 
And third, our product line pruning will temper revenue growth by 1.5 to 2 points in the quarter. 
At the profit line, several other factors, in addition to the revenue of headwinds, will come into play. As we've discussed before, Q4 will be the first period to reflect our independent cost structure and transition to a standalone entity. 
We'll see a full quarter's worth of retiree benefit expenses, fully loaded overhead costs and interest expense reflective of our capital structure on a standalone basis. 
We'll also see higher restructuring costs as we accelerate restructuring activity, and I expect to incur somewhere in the range of $225 million of such costs in the quarter. 
As a result of having quite a few large moving pieces in a short 3-month window, we're not in a position to provide Q4 earnings guidance at this time. However, we still expect to deliver solid underlying profitable growth in 2012. 
And we continue to expect strong results in 2013, consistent with the guidance we've provided at our Investor Day in September. 
On the top line, we're targeting organic revenue growth that meets the rate of North American food and beverage market despite a negative impact of 1 point due to product pruning. 
We expect productivity improvements and overhead savings to drive 2013 EPS of approximately $2.60 on a GAAP basis. This outlook assumes interest expense of approximately $520 million and an effective tax rate of 35%. 
The guidance for the year also includes restructuring cost of about $240 million or $0.26 per share. We'd still expect free cash flow to be about 70% of GAAP net income. And finally, we expect to recommend to our board in December a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or an annual rate of about $2 per share, as previously indicated. 
I'll now turn it over to Tony for some closing remarks. Tony?"

And the investments they've made in innovation and equity, we think allow us to handle the volatility of the cheese cost curve. And we do know with this route that there's going to be some volatility. But when you think about Philadelphia cream cheese, Velveeta, Cracker Barrel, Kraft Singles, I mean, you're talking about some of the real powerful brand names in food and we think we've restored them to some prominence. The market shares in our 4 cheese segments were up significantly and 3 of the segments on a year-to-date basis. And that's a continuation of about 8 quarters of improvement. So while we see volatility, we think the equity investments we've made will allow us to weather that storm."

We can make an adjustment for the restructurings, the unrealized gains and losses on hedges and the trade load. And if you do that for both the third quarter of '12 and the third quarter of '11, I think we should be able to get to a number that's more or less pretty clean. When I make those adjustments, I get operating income that fill me up about $8 million or about 1%, and I would get revenues that are up just about 0.5%. So it -- when I make those adjustments, it doesn't feel maybe as strong as what you guys are saying right now, and I was hoping that you might be able to respond to that or maybe talk me through what other adjustments would be made to have a nice apples-and-apples comparison with the information that we have this morning."

So those are sort of our stated pricing models and predicting what's going to happen in commodities or something that we've -- we, in the industry, approve, and we're not too good at it. How we manage it with our brands that I think is key. On coffee, I love this question, because we have so much work to do. But we have plans in place. Maxwell House today, and you guys give me this data, its margin is disadvantaged by several points versus the other big guy, right? Folgers. And so, I always tell the brands, it's not where they are; it's where they start. We have a lot of low-cost methods, a lot of lean manufacturing going into that Maxwell House facility. We got one of our best lean Six Sigma teams running it, and we see a lot of improvement that will allow us to reinvest in our brands and deliver value to the shareholders. And it's primarily in that roast and ground area that we know we're disadvantaged versus the competitor. But it's not a scale issue. It's a production discipline, methods and improvement issue.

With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Tim McLevish, our CFO. Now during today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. These statements are based on how we see things today so actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings release and Form-10 filing for more details on our forward-looking statements. 
We'll also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and on the Investor Center page of kraftfoodsgroup.com. 
Before we start, I'd like to say a few words on the basis of our third quarter financial presentation contained in the press release issued earlier today and the 10-Q when it is filed. As we discussed at our Investor Day this past September, our third quarter financials were developed on a carve-out basis, consistent with the Form-10 that we filed at the time of separation from what is now called Mondelez International. 
On a carve-out basis, I think you'll find that the net revenue is comparable on a year-over-year basis, and you can see that we delivered solid growth with positive pricing and following mix gains, whether or not you choose to adjust for pruning or the building of safety stock with our retail customers that occurred ahead of our spinoff and related systems switchover. 
On the operating income line, beside from restructuring costs in 2012, operating income is largely comparable, given similar cost-allocation methodologies. And on that basis, we delivered high-quality operating income dollar growth that was driven by productivity gains that funded a significant increase in advertising. 
Below the operating income line, however, year-over-year comparability is lacking, particularly in the areas of interest expense and taxes. And as we've discussed before, these carve-out financials are not fully reflective of our cost structure on a standalone basis going forward. 
So we felt that today's call would be most productive if we were to focus on our business health, the performance of our brand franchises and what to expect to see in our financial reporting going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tony Vernon to talk about our business health and the performance of our brand franchises."

Let me start by saying that judging by our actions and results in the third quarter, we believe we've laid a solid foundation for the future of our $19 billion start-up. 
By the numbers, we liked what we saw on both top and bottom lines. But as Chris explained, there are limitations in conclusions we can draw from the carve-out financials. So without getting into convoluted pro forma discussions, here's what I see in our third quarter results that excites me about the future of the new Kraft. 
First, as I said at our Investor Day, we're focused on profitable growth with a marketing playbook based on advertising investments, top-tier innovation and ""good, better, best"" price value offerings in our key categories. 
Against those objectives, there were several highlights in the quarter. It was our first reporting period of positive pricing and positive vol mix in many quarters. In cheese and dairy, our team has now delivered 9 consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth and operating income growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters by following the playbook I just described. 
In refrigerated meals, Lunchables were up over 13% behind better-for-you innovation. And Oscar Mayer cold cuts continued to grow strongly behind ""good, better, best"" offerings that deliver the right products at the right price points. 
Further, where we've invested as category leaders, great marketing and product innovation, continued to deliver outstanding growth. 
Just listen to these examples among many. Velveeta dinners, up 20%; MiO, up 49%; Philly cream cheese, Kool-Aid Jammers and Cool Whip all showed strong volume and share gains; and Tassimo in Canada nearly doubled from the prior year. 
The second factor I'd highlight is it's all paid for as we recover input costs and redefine efficiency. 
We are taking the key steps on our way to achieving low-cost producer status and lowest cost overheads. 
And third quarter continued our momentum in net productivity savings. We also continued to execute our pricing strategy by pricing to commodities, while managing through the expected elasticity impact. 
The quarter also demonstrated our intent to prune less profitable products, further driving efficiency and simplification in our business model. 
The third factor I'd highlight is our people and how well they performed through our transition to independence. On this front, I'd like to congratulate Tim McLevish and our project management office for getting us ready for an independent Kraft Foods. The task was a complex and significant undertaking. It touched every part of our organization, and all credits to our entire team for a flawless execution. It included several notable accomplishments, separating 2 sales forces and a large distribution and logistics infrastructure, outsourcing in-store merchandising, establishing an investment-grade capital structure, separating our Canada organization and moving our beverages and Planters businesses units from the East Coast to the Midwest. 
Further, the team divided almost 100,000 trademarks, 10,000 contracts, 6,000 patents and 600 software applications. 
With all that going on during this time of great transition, we actually improved on many Operational metrics. For example, customer service levels went up, not down, during the transition. And through it all, our teams remained focused on delivering our annual budget commitments, and our numbers show it. But our work has just begun. We are taking the road less traveled as we create a renaissance in North American food and beverages. But we still have miles ago to deliver on the potential of the best brand portfolio in our industry. 
As I've told you before, we are positioning ourselves to meet significant challenges ahead. The economic environment has not improved and that creates a burning platform for Kraft, our customers and our industry. That is how to consistently grow volume. To achieve it, Kraft must raise advertising levels to competitive benchmarks, continue to drive our innovation advantage and establish ""good, better, best"" offerings in all of our key categories. 
More specifically, our coffee business needs to improve its cost structure and to participate in all of its key segments. 
JELL-O must be revitalized, and we must do it in the face of yogurt's explosive growth. 
And Planters needs significantly more work to reestablish category leadership and profitable growth. And that's just to name a few of our bigger projects. 
To fuel all this, we must also become the low-cost producer on our many leadership brands, and we are only in the early innings of capturing the upside of our cost curve. 
Also, we have much work ahead to make cash king in the new Kraft. So we're building new muscles in integrated business planning, net productivity and disciplined cash management. 
We have made this complicated in the past. It really is about simplification in the new Kraft. We're out to create a robust, repeatable business system, where all of our employees are aligned to drive steady, consistent shareholder return. 
Since I met with you last, we've launched our $19 billion start-up, and we're making the investments in people and culture that I spoke to you about. 
Our beverages and Planters businesses moved from the East Coast, and we are thrilled to have their talents here and soon under one roof. 
Our Northfield campus is taking on a totally new look and feel. We're knocking down walls to create an open and a vibrant workplace that will enable the collaboration and best practice that we weren't getting in our bureaucratic silos. 
Most importantly, we are walking the talk against our goal of being the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our industry, and we are populating the curriculum for our new Kraft University as we speak. 
Our employees are becoming increasingly energized by and engaged in being part of the new Kraft. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to my partner, Tim McLevish, to walk you through what to expect on the financial front as we move forward."

As Chris noted earlier, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect carve-out financials and other separation and carve-out-related effects, which are not fully reflective of what you would expect on a standalone basis going forward. 
With that caveat, we were quite pleased with our underlying results in the quarter. Organic revenue growth of 3.2% includes 2.6 percentage points of pull forwards from customer inventory builds in preparation for the spin. This is partly offset, however, by 1.3 percentage points of extraordinary pruning, as we exit less profitable product lines. 
On an underlying basis, we outpaced market growth, despite only about 60 basis points of pricing. We also drove sizable improvement in our gross profit. While unrealized gains and commodity hedging positions contributed to the favorability, volume mix, pricing net of cost and solid productivity all contributed to the increase. 
SG&A was up considerably from last year, largely driven by an increase in advertising and consumer investments. The remaining increase was due to higher pension costs and some higher one-off costs versus the prior year. 
Absent these factors, our overhead costs were favorable on an underlying basis. In the end, no matter how you cut it, our results reflected solid mid-single-digit operating income growth, consistent with our long-term guidance. 
We delivered high-quality results on the top and the bottom line. We maintained operating momentum, all well executing an unprecedented corporate separation. This is no small task and we are pleased with our results during this time of significant change. 
But as Tony said, there are still much to get through and that goes for our reported financials as well. So let me help guide you through what you can expect to see from us in the coming months. I'll start with our Q4 expectations, which will continue to reflect several impacts from our transition to an independent company. 
We still expect solid consumption growth in Q4 as a result of our investment in brand building and innovation. 
From a revenue perspective, however, we expect Q4 revenues will be flat to down due to 3 significant headwinds. First, we'll be comparing to a high single-digit organic growth in Q4 last year. This was enhanced by retailer purchases made in advance of announced price increases in our ready-to-drink beverage and cheese businesses. 
Second, our customers will be working down the inventories built in Q3. 
And third, our product line pruning will temper revenue growth by 1.5 to 2 points in the quarter. 
At the profit line, several other factors, in addition to the revenue of headwinds, will come into play. As we've discussed before, Q4 will be the first period to reflect our independent cost structure and transition to a standalone entity. 
We'll see a full quarter's worth of retiree benefit expenses, fully loaded overhead costs and interest expense reflective of our capital structure on a standalone basis. 
We'll also see higher restructuring costs as we accelerate restructuring activity, and I expect to incur somewhere in the range of $225 million of such costs in the quarter. 
As a result of having quite a few large moving pieces in a short 3-month window, we're not in a position to provide Q4 earnings guidance at this time. However, we still expect to deliver solid underlying profitable growth in 2012. 
And we continue to expect strong results in 2013, consistent with the guidance we've provided at our Investor Day in September. 
On the top line, we're targeting organic revenue growth that meets the rate of North American food and beverage market despite a negative impact of 1 point due to product pruning. 
We expect productivity improvements and overhead savings to drive 2013 EPS of approximately $2.60 on a GAAP basis. This outlook assumes interest expense of approximately $520 million and an effective tax rate of 35%. 
The guidance for the year also includes restructuring cost of about $240 million or $0.26 per share. We'd still expect free cash flow to be about 70% of GAAP net income. And finally, we expect to recommend to our board in December a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or an annual rate of about $2 per share, as previously indicated. 
I'll now turn it over to Tony for some closing remarks. Tony?"

And the investments they've made in innovation and equity, we think allow us to handle the volatility of the cheese cost curve. And we do know with this route that there's going to be some volatility. But when you think about Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Velveeta, Cracker Barrel, Kraft Singles, I mean, you're talking about some of the real powerful brand names in food and we think we've restored them to some prominence. The market shares in our 4 cheese segments were up significantly and 3 of the segments on a year-to-date basis. And that's a continuation of about 8 quarters of improvement. So while we see volatility, we think the equity investments we've made will allow us to weather that storm."

We can make an adjustment for the restructurings, the unrealized gains and losses on hedges and the trade load. And if you do that for both the third quarter of '12 and the third quarter of '11, I think we should be able to get to a number that's more or less pretty clean. When I make those adjustments, I get operating income that fill me up about $8 million or about 1%, and I would get revenues that are up just about 0.5%. So it -- when I make those adjustments, it doesn't feel maybe as strong as what you guys are saying right now, and I was hoping that you might be able to respond to that or maybe talk me through what other adjustments would be made to have a nice apples-and-apples comparison with the information that we have this morning."

So those are sort of our stated pricing models and predicting what's going to happen in commodities or something that we've -- we, in the industry, approve, and we're not too good at it. How we manage it with our brands that I think is key. On coffee, I love this question, because we have so much work to do. But we have plans in place. Maxwell House today, and you guys give me this data, its margin is disadvantaged by several points versus the other big guy, right? Folgers. And so, I always tell the brands, it's not where they are; it's where they start. We have a lot of low-cost methods, a lot of lean manufacturing going into that Maxwell House facility. We got one of our best lean Six Sigma teams running it, and we see a lot of improvement that will allow us to reinvest in our brands and deliver value to the shareholders.

With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Tim McLevish, our CFO. Now during today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. These statements are based on how we see things today so actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings release and Form-10 filing for more details on our forward-looking statements. 
We'll also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and on the Investor Center page of kraftfoodsgroup.com. 
Before we start, I'd like to say a few words on the basis of our third quarter financial presentation contained in the press release issued earlier today and the 10-Q when it is filed. As we discussed at our Investor Day this past September, our third quarter financials were developed on a carve-out basis, consistent with the Form-10 that we filed at the time of separation from what is now called Mondelez International. 
On a carve-out basis, I think you'll find that the net revenue is comparable on a year-over-year basis, and you can see that we delivered solid growth with positive pricing and following mix gains, whether or not you choose to adjust for pruning or the building of safety stock with our retail customers that occurred ahead of our spinoff and related systems switchover. 
On the operating income line, beside from restructuring costs in 2012, operating income is largely comparable, given similar cost-allocation methodologies. And on that basis, we delivered high-quality operating income dollar growth that was driven by productivity gains that funded a significant increase in advertising. 
Below the operating income line, however, year-over-year comparability is lacking, particularly in the areas of interest expense and taxes. And as we've discussed before, these carve-out financials are not fully reflective of our cost structure on a standalone basis going forward. 
So we felt that today's call would be most productive if we were to focus on our business health, the performance of our brand franchises and what to expect to see in our financial reporting going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tony Vernon to talk about our business health and the performance of our brand franchises."

Let me start by saying that judging by our actions and results in the third quarter, we believe we've laid a solid foundation for the future of our $19 billion start-up. 
By the numbers, we liked what we saw on both top and bottom lines. But as Chris explained, there are limitations in conclusions we can draw from the carve-out financials. So without getting into convoluted pro forma discussions, here's what I see in our third quarter results that excites me about the future of the new Kraft. 
First, as I said at our Investor Day, we're focused on profitable growth with a marketing playbook based on advertising investments, top-tier innovation and ""good, better, best"" price value offerings in our key categories. 
Against those objectives, there were several highlights in the quarter. It was our first reporting period of positive pricing and positive vol mix in many quarters. In cheese and dairy, our team has now delivered 9 consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth and operating income growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters by following the playbook I just described. 
In refrigerated meals, Lunchables were up over 13% behind better-for-you innovation. And Oscar Mayer cold cuts continued to grow strongly behind ""good, better, best"" offerings that deliver the right products at the right price points. 
Further, where we've invested as category leaders, great marketing and product innovation, continued to deliver outstanding growth. 
Just listen to these examples among many. Velveeta dinners, up 20%; MiO, up 49%; Philly cream cheese, Kool-Aid Jammers and Cool Whip all showed strong volume and share gains; and Tassimo in Canada nearly doubled from the prior year. 
The second factor I'd highlight is it's all paid for as we recover input costs and redefine efficiency. 
We are taking the key steps on our way to achieving low-cost producer status and lowest cost overheads. 
And third quarter continued our momentum in net productivity savings. We also continued to execute our pricing strategy by pricing to commodities, while managing through the expected elasticity impact. 
The quarter also demonstrated our intent to prune less profitable products, further driving efficiency and simplification in our business model. 
The third factor I'd highlight is our people and how well they performed through our transition to independence. On this front, I'd like to congratulate Tim McLevish and our project management office for getting us ready for an independent Kraft Foods. The task was a complex and significant undertaking. It touched every part of our organization, and all credits to our entire team for a flawless execution. It included several notable accomplishments, separating 2 sales forces and a large distribution and logistics infrastructure, outsourcing in-store merchandising, establishing an investment-grade capital structure, separating our Canada organization and moving our beverages and Planters businesses units from the East Coast to the Midwest. 
Further, the team divided almost 100,000 trademarks, 10,000 contracts, 6,000 patents and 600 software applications. 
With all that going on during this time of great transition, we actually improved on many Operational metrics. For example, customer service levels went up, not down, during the transition. And through it all, our teams remained focused on delivering our annual budget commitments, and our numbers show it. But our work has just begun. We are taking the road less traveled as we create a renaissance in North American food and beverages. But we still have miles ago to deliver on the potential of the best brand portfolio in our industry. 
As I've told you before, we are positioning ourselves to meet significant challenges ahead. The economic environment has not improved and that creates a burning platform for Kraft, our customers and our industry. That is how to consistently grow volume. To achieve it, Kraft must raise advertising levels to competitive benchmarks, continue to drive our innovation advantage and establish ""good, better, best"" offerings in all of our key categories. 
More specifically, our coffee business needs to improve its cost structure and to participate in all of its key segments. 
JELL-O must be revitalized, and we must do it in the face of yogurt's explosive growth. 
And Planters needs significantly more work to reestablish category leadership and profitable growth. And that's just to name a few of our bigger projects. 
To fuel all this, we must also become the low-cost producer on our many leadership brands, and we are only in the early innings of capturing the upside of our cost curve. 
Also, we have much work ahead to make cash king in the new Kraft. So we're building new muscles in integrated business planning, net productivity and disciplined cash management. 
We have made this complicated in the past. It really is about simplification in the new Kraft. We're out to create a robust, repeatable business system, where all of our employees are aligned to drive steady, consistent shareholder return. 
Since I met with you last, we've launched our $19 billion start-up, and we're making the investments in people and culture that I spoke to you about. 
Our beverages and Planters businesses moved from the East Coast, and we are thrilled to have their talents here and soon under one roof. 
Our Northfield campus is taking on a totally new look and feel. We're knocking down walls to create an open and a vibrant workplace that will enable the collaboration and best practice that we weren't getting in our bureaucratic silos. 
Most importantly, we are walking the talk against our goal of being the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our industry, and we are populating the curriculum for our new Kraft University as we speak. 
Our employees are becoming increasingly energized by and engaged in being part of the new Kraft. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to my partner, Tim McLevish, to walk you through what to expect on the financial front as we move forward."

As Chris noted earlier, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect carve-out financials and other separation and carve-out-related effects, which are not fully reflective of what you would expect on a standalone basis going forward. 
With that caveat, we were quite pleased with our underlying results in the quarter. Organic revenue growth of 3.2% includes 2.6 percentage points of pull forwards from customer inventory builds in preparation for the spin. This is partly offset, however, by 1.3 percentage points of extraordinary pruning, as we exit less profitable product lines. 
On an underlying basis, we outpaced market growth, despite only about 60 basis points of pricing. We also drove sizable improvement in our gross profit. While unrealized gains and commodity hedging positions contributed to the favorability, volume mix, pricing net of cost and solid productivity all contributed to the increase. 
SG&A was up considerably from last year, largely driven by an increase in advertising and consumer investments. The remaining increase was due to higher pension costs and some higher one-off costs versus the prior year. 
Absent these factors, our overhead costs were favorable on an underlying basis. In the end, no matter how you cut it, our results reflected solid mid-single-digit operating income growth, consistent with our long-term guidance. 
We delivered high-quality results on the top and the bottom line. We maintained operating momentum, all well executing an unprecedented corporate separation. This is no small task and we are pleased with our results during this time of significant change. 
But as Tony said, there are still much to get through and that goes for our reported financials as well. So let me help guide you through what you can expect to see from us in the coming months. I'll start with our Q4 expectations, which will continue to reflect several impacts from our transition to an independent company. 
We still expect solid consumption growth in Q4 as a result of our investment in brand building and innovation. 
From a revenue perspective, however, we expect Q4 revenues will be flat to down due to 3 significant headwinds. First, we'll be comparing to a high single-digit organic growth in Q4 last year. This was enhanced by retailer purchases made in advance of announced price increases in our ready-to-drink beverage and cheese businesses. 
Second, our customers will be working down the inventories built in Q3. 
And third, our product line pruning will temper revenue growth by 1.5 to 2 points in the quarter. 
At the profit line, several other factors, in addition to the revenue of headwinds, will come into play. As we've discussed before, Q4 will be the first period to reflect our independent cost structure and transition to a standalone entity. 
We'll see a full quarter's worth of retiree benefit expenses, fully loaded overhead costs and interest expense reflective of our capital structure on a standalone basis. 
We'll also see higher restructuring costs as we accelerate restructuring activity, and I expect to incur somewhere in the range of $225 million of such costs in the quarter. 
As a result of having quite a few large moving pieces in a short 3-month window, we're not in a position to provide Q4 earnings guidance at this time. However, we still expect to deliver solid underlying profitable growth in 2012. 
And we continue to expect strong results in 2013, consistent with the guidance we've provided at our Investor Day in September. 
On the top line, we're targeting organic revenue growth that meets the rate of North American food and beverage market despite a negative impact of 1 point due to product pruning. 
We expect productivity improvements and overhead savings to drive 2013 EPS of approximately $2.60 on a GAAP basis. This outlook assumes interest expense of approximately $520 million and an effective tax rate of 35%. 
The guidance for the year also includes restructuring cost of about $240 million or $0.26 per share. We'd still expect free cash flow to be about 70% of GAAP net income. And finally, we expect to recommend to our board in December a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or an annual rate of about $2 per share, as previously indicated. 
I'll now turn it over to Tony for some closing remarks. Tony?"

But when you think about Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Velveeta, Cracker Barrel, Kraft Singles, I mean, you're talking about some of the real powerful brand names in food and we think we've restored them to some prominence. The market shares in our 4 cheese segments were up significantly and 3 of the segments on a year-to-date basis. And that's a continuation of about 8 quarters of improvement. So while we see volatility, we think the equity investments we've made will allow us to weather that storm."

We can make an adjustment for the restructurings, the unrealized gains and losses on hedges and the trade load. And if you do that for both the third quarter of '12 and the third quarter of '11, I think we should be able to get to a number that's more or less pretty clean. When I make those adjustments, I get operating income that fill me up about $8 million or about 1%, and I would get revenues that are up just about 0.5%. So it -- when I make those adjustments, it doesn't feel maybe as strong as what you guys are saying right now, and I was hoping that you might be able to respond to that or maybe talk me through what other adjustments would be made to have a nice apples-and-apples comparison with the information that we have this morning."

How we manage it with our brands that I think is key. On coffee, I love this question, because we have so much work to do. But we have plans in place. Maxwell House today, and you guys give me this data, its margin is disadvantaged by several points versus the other big guy, right? Folgers. And so, I always tell the brands, it's not where they are; it's where they start. We have a lot of low-cost methods, a lot of lean manufacturing going into that Maxwell House facility. We got one of our best lean Six Sigma teams running it, and we see a lot of improvement that will allow us to reinvest in our brands and deliver value to the shareholders.
