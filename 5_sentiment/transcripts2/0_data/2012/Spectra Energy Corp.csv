And thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realize net income in doing so. With respect to the fourth quarter, I'm aware that the outcome was lower that some of you has estimated and Pat will take you through the details, I thought it would be worth while to speak to some of the unusual items and unique timing of some of those items as context for the quarter. In the quarter we booked a number of items that reduced income. They were associated with one, software amortization; two, employee benefits; three, acquisition-related settlements; four, captive insurance claims; and five, some tax adjustments. In total, these items weight on earnings by about $0.03 a share. Added to these were NGL curtailments and plant reliability challenges. These lower DCPs earnings by about $0.01 this year. And then finally, with the warm start to the winter, we were able to do more plant maintenance work at U.S. Transmission and Union Gas, which increased O&M trust at those business units. Together, these items resulted in a a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share and represented an accumulation of relatively small items that either would not typically cross during a single quarter or as in the case of NGL curtailments, are short lived. Thanks to DCP's current investment and NGL pipeline's and plant capacity. To the extent that any of these items may occur again in 2012, they've been taken into account in our guidance to you. 
So turning back now to the bigger picture and the overall year, as I mentioned, we finished the year with record net income. We indicated that we expected to exceed our ongoing EPS target by $1.65 for the year and we did, delivering earnings per share of $1.77. In support of that achievement, each of our business segments delivered nice EBIT increases for the year, for benefiting changing market fundamentals that support our growing Gas Transmission business and our Gas Processing and Distribution business throughout North America. As we look back on the year, we saw a healthy pickup at DCP from favorable NGL pricing. But as a result of the curtailments I've previously mentioned and the effects of winter storms that you recall early in 2011, as well as plant reliability challenges, we didn't realize all the pickup. Fortunately, the new infrastructure being built at DCPs such as Southern Hills and Sandhills will ensure that we do unlock our growing NGL volumes and reach premium pricing markets such as Mont Belvieu. 
Expect that Q4 curtailment issues I mentioned, DCPs year end NGL production volumes were 6% above fourth quarter 2010 levels. During the year, U.S. Transmission grew on it's ongoing EBIT by approximately 5% as it realized earnings from new projects brought into service. U.S. Transmission continues on a stable track. While we have growth in both 2012 and 2013 EBIT in this business unit, we expect the next significant growth in its EBIT to occur when we realized the full year benefits of our New Jersey, New York project in 2014. 
In Western Canada, in spite of higher extraction premiums, our Empress NGL business experienced strong sales volumes relative to our initial expectations. We've provided I have a healthy boost to Western Canadian trends and processing. And despite of warm start to the 2011, 2012 winter and a sluggish Ontario economy, our gas utility, Union Gas, grew its EBIT by almost 4%. The point of all this is the power of the Spectra Energy entire portfolio allows us to perform consistently growing earnings and the dividend even in the face of various market cycles and operational scenarios. 
Turning to the dividend, during 2011, we increased it by about 8% and we have the confidence in our growth plans to commit to delivering annual dividend growth of at least $0.08 per year on an ongoing basis. We invested more than $1 billion in capital expansion during the year and placed 6 projects in the service. Successful execution of our CapEx plan allows us to continue to achieve aggregate return on capital employed in excess of our targeted 10% to 12%. In addition to the organic growth and expansions, we executed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. We acquired the Big Sandy Pipeline in Eastern Kentucky to our MLPs Spectra Energy Partners and the DCP Midstream acquired the Southern Hills Pipeline targeting new NGL transportation capacity from the Mid-Continent to the premium Gulf Coast market. Our share of DCP cash distributions was about $400 million in 2011, exceeding our initial expectations by almost $50 million. And we expect distributions to continue increasing as DCP grows its earnings. In fact, for 2012, we should receive distributions from DCP of $460 million, 15% higher than in 2011. And we committed to look forward positioning ourselves strategically, leveraging our enviable asset position and seeking accretive capital investment such as recently announced TEAM 2014, open and next opportunities. Overall, we continue to have a balanced approach to serving our investors through both earnings and dividend growth. And we have the flexibility to toggle between the 2 to ensure consistent level of total shareholder return through all market cycles. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide detail for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen on our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings o",1245,"Well thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen on our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings of $287 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the year, we delivered record ongoing earnings of about $1.16 billion or $1.77 per share. The annual results reflects solid performance from all of our businesses. In particular, we benefited from expansion project placed into service, higher commodity prices at DCP and a stronger Canadian dollar. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA. For the year, EBITDA increased by almost 9% from about $3 billion in 2010 to more than $3.3 billion in 2011. And as you may recall from our Analyst Day last month, our 2012 EBITDA is budgeted at $3.5 billion, up another 6%. So strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allows us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity while maintaining a solid BBB balance sheet. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with U.S. Transmission, which recorded ongoing EBIT of $226 million compared with $237 million in 2010. The 2011 quarter reflects higher operating costs and as expected, lower revenues at those Art Gas transmission. These results were partially offset by incremental earnings from our expansion projects. For the full year, ongoing EBIT for U.S. Transmission increased nearly 5% from $938 million in 2010 to $983 million in 2011. 
Now let's turn to Distribution, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $120 million., compared with $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease is primarily due to lower customer usage related to weather that was nearly 15% warmer than the prior year. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Distribution increased almost 4% from $409 million in 2010 to $425 million in 2011. 
Let's focus now on results that are Western Canada Transmission & Processing business, which reported ongoing fourth quarter 2011 EBIT of $137 million compared with $131 million in the fourth quarter 2010. This segment benefited from improved results in the gathering processing business driven primarily by higher earnings from expansion in the Farm River area British Columbia. These results were partially offset by lower earnings NGL business attributable mainly to significantly higher cost of NGL extraction met our higher sales prices. Year end ongoing EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $510 million compared with $409 million in 2010, representing an increase of nearly 25%. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services reported fourth quarter EBIT of $96 million compared with $108 million in the fourth quarter 2010. The 2011 quarter results reflect the effects of plant higher operating costs, short-term reliability issues and NGL curtailments, primarily occurring in the Permian Basin. We also recorded lower gains associated with sale of common units by DPM. These results more than offset the benefit seen from increased NGL prices and volume growth compared to the fourth quarter 2010. As Greg told you, the curtailment issues encountered last year, further underscores the need for DCP's Sandhills Pipeline which will play a key role in opening up the flow of NGLs to premium Gulf Coast markets particularly from processing plants located in the Permian. On average, NGL prices were $0.14 higher this quarter compared to 2010. Nymex natural gas averaged $0.25 lower in 2011 and crude oil was $9 higher per barrel. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Field Services were $449 million compared with $335 million in 2010 representing a 34% increase. And as previously mentioned, DCP Midstream paid distributions to us of $395 million for the year, exceeding our target of $350 million. 
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of governance costs and captive insurance and some additional items. Other reported net costs of $28 million in the fourth quarter 2011 compared with ongoing net cost of $16 million in 2010. The unfavorable variants reflects higher captive insurance cost from miscellaneous loss events and other corporate expenses. UN net cost for other were $104 million compared with $62 million in 2010, higher self insured insurance losses benefit costs and similar corporate expenses account for the variants. Our ongoing annual run rate for corporate other costs should be in the neighborhood of $100 million and is reflected at that level in our 2012 earnings guidance. Additional items affecting net income include interest expense for the quarter of $154 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter 2011 ongoing income tax expense from continuing operations of $115 million compared to the $128 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 56%. Going forward, we expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while maintaining strong investment rate coverage ratios. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In other words, more than adequate to supplement our internally generated cash. 
So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, now let's take a look at how how we reconcile our 2011 actual performance to our 2012 plan. As we look forward to 2012, let's begin with the actual 2011 ongoing net income of about $1.16 billion which supports our $1.77 earnings per share and compare that to our 2012 projected net income of about $1.24 billion or $1.90 per share. You can see that the ongoing successful execution of our expansion program will be the largest single contributor to earnings growth with $125 million of incremental EBIT expected in 2012. The split on each earnings will be about 60% from Western Canada and 40% from our U.S. Transmission operations. We also expect a significant contribution from DCP Midstream expansion efforts and slightly higher commodity prices. As we've mentioned previously, we continue to see volume decline in the conventional areas of British Columbia as a result of lower gas prices. With lower contracted volumes in these areas, Western Canada is expecting a negative $65 million earnings affect in 2012. Also as expected, storage margins continue to be soft, resulting in a storage EBIT reduction of about $30 million, with about 3/4 of that coming from the U.S. Transmission and 1/4 coming from Distribution. Our plan calls for slightly higher interest expense primarily as a result of higher debt balances associated with funding our growth CapEx. And of course, the $30 million tax effect is a result of the earnings change as shown here. One supplemental piece of information I'd like to add to the 2012 data we shared with you pervasively New York has to do with the Distribution of our quarterly earnings. As you know, while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I can't tell you that all of our projected 2012 earnings growth is reflected in the second half of the year. We don't expect the first and second quarters of 2012 to look materially different from 2011. But the first quarter slightly higher and second quarters slightly lower assuming of course that all of our forecast assumptions are realized. Now let me turn things back over to Greg who will speak for 2012 in our active commitment to delivering strong and sustained earnings growth well beyond this year."

And just to recap, 2011 was one of the strongest years in our history with record net income and we continue to benefit from the strong macroenvironment that supports our growing gas transmission business and accelerated in the growth of our gas processing business activities in North America. In early '07, we told you we'd grow earnings by investing about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses and attractive returns on capital in a 10% to 12% range. As you can see here, we're not only meeting that commitment but we're here. We tend to continue that growth focus and going forward, we see opportunities to possibly invest about $15 billion through the end of the decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash growth, robust returns in capital in that 10% to 12% range. And you can expect an additional $6 billion capital investment kicker from DCP, where returns will average in the mid to high teens. That's an impressive record of execution and frankly a menu of opportunity. The power of our portfolio is driven by a number of integrated elements. First, our expansive asset footprint featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage, our considerable financial strength and flexibility, multiple financing vehicles, be that see corpse or MLPs or the partnership that we've launched, our proven track record of delivering attractive returns and capital employed and finally, reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. Our confidence in other ability to continue being the investment opportunity of choice is crowded in 125% total shareholder return that we provided investors over the last 3 years. We know how to create value and improvement. So with that, we'll turn things back to John and we'll open it up to take your questions."

And most of our customers are large LDCs as well so those guys are rock solid. If I think about some of the new projects that we announced TEAM 2014, the 2 anchor shippers that we signed up there are both very solid players as well. So I don't see it -- sustained in a very long period of time obviously that will be a little bit more concerning. But then you see big folks coming in and picking up these assets, right? You're looking at that excellent coming in and doing its call earlier this week maybe a quick glance to continue to drillout its program and that's focus on the short-term. So I don't see that as a big negative intermediate term, that's for sure. In the low gas prices lead to much stronger demand and that tends to fix itself therefore driving up the prices. So I think we're pretty careful from the credit perspective. We continue to be able to bring in projects like 2014. I feel very good about the plans that we have an projects in execution today they're going to work through any downtick here in natural gas prices in the short-term. We often forget as an industry that whether is a huge factor here and what I can tell you is if you turn to the DCP business, it's really not about $2 or $3 or $4 gas, it's about a liquid. The places where in that Permian, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, those places are going to get drilled out at 2, 3, 4 oil gas because you're really going after liquids."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doin",902,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doing so. With respect to the fourth quarter, I'm aware that the outcome was lower than some of you had estimated, and while Pat will take you through the details, I thought it'd be worthwhile to speak to some of the unusual items and unique timing of some of those items as context for the quarter. 
In the quarter, we booked a number of items that reduced income. They were associated with one, software amortization; two, employee benefits; three, acquisition-related settlements; four, captive insurance claims; and five, some tax adjustments. In total, these items weighed on earnings by about $0.03 a share. Added to these were NGL curtailments and plant reliability challenges that lowered DCPs earnings by about $0.01 this year. And then finally, with the warm start to the winter, we were able to do more plant maintenance work at U.S. Transmission and Union Gas, which increased O&M costs at those business units. Together, these items resulted in a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share, and represented an accumulation of relatively small items that either would not typically cluster in a single quarter or, as in the case of NGL curtailments, are short lived, thanks to DCP's current investment in NGL pipelines and plant capacity. To the extent that any of these items may occur again in 2012, they've been taken into account in our guidance to you. 
So turning back now to the bigger picture and the overall year, as I mentioned, we finished the year with record net income. We indicated that we expected to exceed our ongoing EPS target of $1.65 for the year, and we did, delivering earnings per share of $1.77. In support of that achievement, each of our business segments delivered nice EBIT increases for the year. We're benefiting from changing market fundamentals that support our growing Gas Transmission business and our Gas Processing and Distribution business throughout North America. As we look back on the year, we saw a healthy pickup at DCP from favorable NGL pricing. But as a result of the curtailments I've previously mentioned and the effects of winter storms that you'll recall early in 2011, as well as plant reliability challenges, we didn't realize all of that pickup. Fortunately, the new infrastructure being built at DCP such as Southern Hills and Sand Hills will ensure that we do unlock our growing NGL volumes and reach premium pricing markets such as Mont Belvieu. 
Despite that Q4 curtailment issues I mentioned, DCP's year-end NGL production volumes were 6% above fourth quarter 2010 levels. During the year, U.S. Transmission grew its ongoing EBIT by approximately 5%, as it realized earnings from new projects brought into service. U.S. Transmission continues on a stable track. While we have growth in both 2012 and 2013 EBIT in this business unit, we expect the next significant growth in its EBIT to occur when we realized the full year benefits of our New Jersey - New York project in 2014. 
In Western Canada, in spite of higher extraction premiums, our Empress NGL business experienced strong sales volumes relative to our initial expectations. We've provided a healthy boost to Western Canadian Transmission & Processing. And despite a warm start to the 2011, 2012 winter and a sluggish Ontario economy, our gas utility, Union Gas, grew its EBIT by almost 4%. The point of all of this is the power of Spectra Energy's entire portfolio allows us to perform consistently, growing earnings and the dividend, even in the face of various market cycles and operational scenarios. 
Turning to the dividend, during 2011, we increased it by about 8% and we have the confidence in our growth plans to commit to delivering annual dividend growth of at least $0.08 per year on an ongoing basis. We invested more than $1 billion in capital expansion during the year and placed 6 projects in the service. Successful execution of our CapEx plan allows us to continue to achieve aggregate returns on capital employed, in excess of our targeted 10% to 12%. 
In addition to the organic growth and expansions, we executed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. We acquired the Big Sandy Pipeline in Eastern Kentucky to our MLP Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream acquired Southern Hills Pipeline, targeting new NGL transportation capacity from the mid-Continent to the premium Gulf Coast market. Our share of DCP cash distributions was about $400 million in 2011, exceeding our initial expectations by almost $50 million, and we expect distributions to continue increasing as DCP grows its earnings. In fact, for 2012, we should receive distributions from DCP of $460 million, 15% higher than in 2011. And we committed to look forward positioning ourselves strategically, leveraging our enviable asset position and seeking accretive capital investment such as recently announced TEAM 2014, open and next opportunities. Overall, we continue to have a balanced approach to serving our investors through both earnings and dividend growth, and we have the flexibility to toggle between the 2 to ensure consistent level of total shareholder return through all market cycles. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide detail for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen on our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings",1262,"Well, thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen on our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings of $287 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the year, we delivered record ongoing earnings of about $1.16 billion or $1.77 per share. The annual results reflect solid performance from all of our businesses. In particular, we benefited from expansion project placed into service, higher commodity prices at DCP and a stronger Canadian dollar. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA. For the year, EBITDA increased by almost 9%, from about $3 billion in 2010 to more than $3.3 billion in 2011. And as you may recall from our Analyst Day last month, our 2012 EBITDA is budgeted at $3.5 billion, up another 6%. So strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allows us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while maintaining a solid BBB balance sheet. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with U.S. Transmission, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $226 million, compared with $237 million in 2010. The 2011 quarter reflects higher operating costs and as expected, lower revenues at Ozark Gas Transmission. These results were partially offset by incremental earnings from our expansion projects.  For the full year, ongoing EBIT for U.S. Transmission increased nearly 5% from $938 million in 2010 to $983 million in 2011. 
Now let's turn to Distribution, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $120 million, compared with $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease is primarily due to lower customer usage related to weather that was nearly 15% warmer than the prior year. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Distribution increased almost 4% from $409 million in 2010 to $425 million in 2011. 
Let's focus now on results that are Western Canada Transmission & Processing business, which reported ongoing fourth quarter 2011 EBIT of $137 million, compared with $131 million in the fourth quarter 2010. This segment benefited from improved results in the gathering and processing business, driven primarily by higher earnings from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. These results were partially offset by lower earnings at the Empress NGL business, attributable mainly to significantly higher cost of NGL extraction, net of higher sales prices. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $510 million, compared with $409 million in 2010, representing an increase of nearly 25%. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which, as you know, represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services reported fourth quarter EBIT of $96 million, compared with $108 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The 2011 quarter results reflect the effects of plant higher operating costs, short-term reliability issues and NGL curtailments, primarily occurring in the Permian Basin. We also recorded lower gains associated with the sale of common units by DPM. These results more than offset the benefit seen from increased NGL prices and volume growth, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. As Greg told you, the curtailment issues encountered last year further underscore the critical need for DCP's Sand Hills Pipeline, which will play a key role in opening up the flow of NGLs to premium Gulf Coast markets, particularly from processing plants located in the Permian. 
On average, NGL prices were $0.14 per gallon higher this quarter, compared with 2010. NYMEX natural gas averaged $0.25 lower in 2011 and crude oil was $9 higher per barrel. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Field Services was $449 million, compared with $335 million in 2010, representing a 34% increase. And as previously mentioned, DCP Midstream paid distributions to us of $395 million for the year, exceeding our target of $350 million. 
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of our corporate governance costs and captive insurance and some additional items. Other reported net costs of $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with ongoing net cost of $16 million in 2010. The unfavorable variance reflects higher captive insurance cost from miscellaneous loss events and other corporate expenses. Year-end net cost for Other were $104 million, compared with $62 million in 2010. Higher self-insured insurance losses, benefit costs and similar corporate expenses account for the variance. Our ongoing annual run rate for corporate other costs should be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and is reflected at that level in our 2012 earnings guidance. Additional items affecting net income include: Interest expense for the quarter of $154 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter 2011 ongoing income tax expense from continuing operations of $115 million compared to the $128 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 56%. Going forward, we expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while maintaining strong investment grade coverage ratios. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In other words, more than adequate to supplement our internally generated cash. 
So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, now let's take a look at how we reconcile our 2011 actual performance to our 2012 plan. As we look forward to 2012, let's begin with the actual 2011 ongoing net income of about $1.16 billion, which supports our $1.77 earnings per share, and compare that to our 2012 projected net income of about $1.24 billion or $1.90 per share. You can see that the ongoing successful execution of our expansion program will be the largest single contributor to earnings growth with $125 million of incremental EBIT expected in 2012. The split on each earnings will be about 60% from Western Canada and 40% from our U.S. Transmission operations. We also expect a significant contribution from DCP Midstream's expansion efforts and slightly higher commodity prices. 
As we've mentioned previously, we continue to see volume declines in the conventional areas of British Columbia, as a result of low gas prices. With lower contracted volumes in these areas, Western Canada is expecting a negative $65 million earnings effect in 2012. Also as expected, storage margins continue to be soft, resulting in a storage EBIT reduction of about $30 million, with about 3/4 of that coming from U.S. Transmission and 1/4 from Distribution. Our plan calls for slightly higher interest expense, primarily as a result of higher debt balances associated with funding our growth CapEx. And, of course, the $30 million tax effect is a result of the earnings change as shown here. One supplemental piece of information I'd like to add to the 2012 data we shared with you a few weeks ago in New York has to do with the Distribution of our quarterly earnings. As you know, while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I can tell you that all of our projected 2012 earnings growth is reflected in the second half of the year. We don't expect the first and second quarters of 2012 to look materially different from 2011, with the first quarter slightly higher and second quarter slightly lower, assuming, of course, that all of our forecast assumptions are realized. Now let me turn things back over to Greg, who'll speak to 2012 and our active commitment to delivering strong and sustained earnings growth well beyond this year."

And just to recap, 2011 was one of the strongest years in our history, with record net income and we'd continue to benefit from the strong macro environment that supports our growing gas transmission business and is accelerating the growth of our gas processing business activities throughout North America. 
In early '07, we told you we'd grow earnings by investing about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses and attractive returns on capital in the 10% to 12% range. As you can see here, we're not only meeting that commitment, but we're here. We intend to continue that growth focus, and going forward, we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion through the end of the decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash growth, with robust returns in capital in that 10% to 12% range. And you can expect an additional $6 billion capital investment kicker from DCP, where returns will average in the mid to high teens. That's an impressive record of execution and, frankly, a menu of opportunity. 
The power of our portfolio is driven by a number of integrated elements: First, our expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage; our considerable financial strength and flexibility; multiple financing vehicles, be that C-Corps or MLPs or the partnerships that we belong to; our proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed; and finally, reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. Our confidence in our ability to continue being the investment opportunity of choice is crowded in the 125% total shareholder return that we provided investors over the last 3 years. We know how to create value and improvement. So with that, we'll turn things back over to John, and we'll open it up to take your questions."

In fact 85%, so that doesn't worry me. And most of our customers are large LDCs, as well, so those guys are rock solid. If I think about some of the new projects, like we announced, TEAM 2014, the 2 anchor shippers that we signed up there are both very solid players as well. So I don't see it -- if that was sustained over a very long period of time, obviously that would be a little bit more concerning. But then you see, Faisel, the big folks coming in and picking up these assets, right? I mean you're looking at Exelon coming in and I think during its earnings call earlier this week, it may declare plans to continue to drill out its program. And that's got us focused on the short term. So I don't see that as a big negative in the medium term, that's for sure. Low gas prices lead to much stronger demand, and that tends to fix itself there more than driving up the prices. So I think we're pretty careful from a credit perspective. We continue to be able to bring in projects like 2014. So I feel very good about the plans that we have in-date, the projects in execution to-date are going to work through any downtick here in natural gas prices in the short term. What we often forget, as an industry, that weather is a huge factor here and what I can tell you is if you turn to the DCP business, it's really not about $2 or $3 or $4 gas, it's about the liquids, and the places where we are in the Permian, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, those places are going to get drilled out at $2, $3, $4 gas because you're really going after liquids."

I haven't -- I guess the bottom line is we continued to see the growth far outstripping in decline, where people have laid rates down on the conventional side. And you're right, LNG is an opportunity out there as well. I don't know if you saw, but CNPC, I think, picked up a big piece of Shell's Montney play, today, that was announced.

As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doin",903,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doing so. With respect to the fourth quarter, I'm aware that the outcome was lower than some of you had estimated, and while Pat will take you through the details, I thought it'd be worthwhile to speak to some of the unusual items and unique timing of some of those items as context for the quarter. 
In the quarter, we booked a number of items that reduced income. They were associated with , 1, software amortization; 2, employee benefits; 3, acquisition-related settlements; 4, captive insurance claims; and 5, some tax adjustments. In total, these items weighed on earnings by about $0.03 a share. Added to these were NGL curtailments and plant reliability challenges that lowered DCPs earnings by about $0.01 this year. And then finally, with the warm start to the winter, we were able to do more plant maintenance work at U.S. Transmission and Union Gas, which increased O&M costs at those business units. Together, these items resulted in a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share, and represented an accumulation of relatively small items that either would not typically cluster in a single quarter or, as in the case of NGL curtailments, are short lived, thanks to DCP's current investment in NGL pipelines and plant capacity. To the extent that any of these items may occur again in 2012, they've been taken into account in our guidance to you. 
So turning back now to the bigger picture and the overall year, as I mentioned, we finished the year with record net income. We indicated that we expected to exceed our ongoing EPS target of $1.65 for the year, and we did, delivering earnings per share of $1.77. In support of that achievement, each of our business segments delivered nice EBIT increases for the year. We're benefiting from changing market fundamentals that support our growing Gas Transmission business and our Gas Processing and Distribution business throughout North America. As we look back on the year, we saw a healthy pickup at DCP from favorable NGL pricing. But as a result of the curtailments I've previously mentioned and the effects of winter storms that you'll recall early in 2011, as well as plant reliability challenges, we didn't realize all of that pickup. Fortunately, the new infrastructure being built at DCP, such as Southern Hills and Sand Hills, will ensure that we do unlock our growing NGL volumes and reach premium pricing markets such as Mont Belvieu. 
Despite that Q4 curtailment issues I mentioned, DCP's year-end NGL production volumes were 6% above fourth quarter 2010 levels. During the year, U.S. Transmission grew its ongoing EBIT by approximately 5%, as it realized earnings from new projects brought into service. U.S. Transmission continues on a stable track. While we have growth in both 2012 and 2013 EBIT in this business unit, we expect the next significant growth in its EBIT to occur when we realize the full year benefits of our New Jersey - New York project in 2014. 
In Western Canada, in spite of higher extraction premiums, our Empress NGL business experienced strong sales volumes relative to our initial expectations. We've provided a healthy boost to Western Canadian Transmission & Processing. And despite a warm start to the 2011, 2012 winter and a sluggish Ontario economy, our gas utility, Union Gas, grew its EBIT by almost 4%. The point of all of this is the power of Spectra Energy's entire portfolio allows us to perform consistently, growing earnings and the dividend, even in the face of various market cycles and operational scenarios. 
Turning to the dividend, during 2011, we increased it by about 8% and we have the confidence in our growth plans to commit to delivering annual dividend growth of at least $0.08 per year on an ongoing basis. We invested more than $1 billion in capital expansion during the year and placed 6 projects in the service. Successful execution of our CapEx plan allows us to continue to achieve aggregate returns on capital employed, in excess of our targeted 10% to 12%. 
In addition to the organic growth and expansions, we executed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. We acquired the Big Sandy Pipeline in Eastern Kentucky to our MLP Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream acquired Southern Hills Pipeline, targeting new NGL transportation capacity from the mid-Continent to the premium Gulf Coast market. Our share of DCP cash distributions was about $400 million in 2011, exceeding our initial expectations by almost $50 million, and we expect distributions to continue increasing as DCP grows its earnings. In fact, for 2012, we should receive distributions from DCP of $460 million, 15% higher than in 2011. And we committed to look forward positioning ourselves strategically, leveraging our enviable asset position and seeking accretive capital investment such as recently announced TEAM 2014, open and next opportunities. Overall, we continue to have a balanced approach to serving our investors through both earnings and dividend growth, and we have the flexibility to toggle between the 2 to ensure consistent level of total shareholder return through all market cycles. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide detail for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings",1262,"Well, thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings of $287 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the year, we delivered record ongoing earnings of about $1.16 billion or $1.77 per share. The annual results reflect solid performance from all of our businesses. In particular, we benefited from expansion projects placed into service, higher commodity prices at DCP and a stronger Canadian dollar. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA. For the year, EBITDA increased by almost 9%, from about $3 billion in 2010 to more than $3.3 billion in 2011. And as you may recall from our Analyst Day last month, our 2012 EBITDA is budgeted at $3.5 billion, up another 6%. So strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allows us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while maintaining a solid BBB balance sheet. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with U.S. Transmission, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $226 million, compared with $237 million in 2010. The 2011 quarter reflects higher operating costs and as expected, lower revenues at Ozark Gas Transmission. These results were partially offset by incremental earnings from our expansion projects.  For the full year, ongoing EBIT for U.S. Transmission increased nearly 5% from $938 million in 2010 to $983 million in 2011. 
Now let's turn to Distribution, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $120 million, compared with $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease is primarily due to lower customer usage related to weather that was nearly 15% warmer than the prior year. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Distribution increased almost 4% from $409 million in 2010 to $425 million in 2011. 
Let's focus now on results that are Western Canada Transmission & Processing business, which reported ongoing fourth quarter 2011 EBIT of $137 million, compared with $131 million in the fourth quarter 2010. This segment benefited from improved results in the gathering and processing business, driven primarily by higher earnings from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. These results were partially offset by lower earnings at the Empress NGL business, attributable mainly to significantly higher cost of NGL extraction, net of higher sales prices. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $510 million, compared with $409 million in 2010, representing an increase of nearly 25%. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which, as you know, represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services reported fourth quarter EBIT of $96 million, compared with $108 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The 2011 quarter results reflect the effects of plant higher operating costs, short-term reliability issues and NGL curtailments, primarily occurring in the Permian Basin. We also recorded lower gains associated with the sale of common units by DPM. These results more than offset the benefit seen from increased NGL prices and volume growth, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. As Greg told you, the curtailment issues encountered last year further underscore the critical need for DCP's Sand Hills Pipeline, which will play a key role in opening up the flow of NGLs to premium Gulf Coast markets, particularly from processing plants located in the Permian. 
On average, NGL prices were $0.14 per gallon higher this quarter, compared with 2010. NYMEX natural gas averaged $0.25 lower in 2011 and crude oil was $9 higher per barrel. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Field Services was $449 million, compared with $335 million in 2010, representing a 34% increase. And as previously mentioned, DCP Midstream paid distributions to us of $395 million for the year, exceeding our target of $350 million. 
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of our corporate governance costs and captive insurance and some additional items. Other reported net costs of $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with ongoing net cost of $16 million in 2010. The unfavorable variance reflects higher captive insurance cost from miscellaneous loss events and other corporate expenses. Year-end net cost for Other were $104 million, compared with $62 million in 2010. Higher self-insured insurance losses, benefit costs and similar corporate expenses account for the variance. Our ongoing annual run rate for corporate other costs should be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and is reflected at that level in our 2012 earnings guidance. Additional items affecting net income include: Interest expense for the quarter of $154 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter 2011 ongoing income tax expense from continuing operations of $115 million compared to the $128 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 56%. Going forward, we expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while maintaining strong investment grade coverage ratios. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In other words, more than adequate to supplement our internally generated cash. 
So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, now let's take a look at how we reconcile our 2011 actual performance to our 2012 plan. As we look forward to 2012, let's begin with the actual 2011 ongoing net income of about $1.16 billion, which supports our $1.77 earnings per share, and compare that to our 2012 projected net income of about $1.24 billion or $1.90 per share. You can see that the ongoing successful execution of our expansion program will be the largest single contributor to earnings growth with $125 million of incremental EBIT expected in 2012. The split on each earnings will be about 60% from Western Canada and 40% from our U.S. Transmission operations. We also expect a significant contribution from DCP Midstream's expansion efforts and slightly higher commodity prices. 
As we've mentioned previously, we continue to see volume declines in the conventional areas of British Columbia, as a result of low gas prices. With lower contracted volumes in these areas, Western Canada is expecting a negative $65 million earnings effect in 2012. Also as expected, storage margins continue to be soft, resulting in a storage EBIT reduction of about $30 million, with about 3/4 of that coming from U.S. Transmission and 1/4 from Distribution. Our plan calls for slightly higher interest expense, primarily as a result of higher debt balances associated with funding our growth CapEx. And, of course, the $30 million tax effect is a result of the earnings change as shown here. One supplemental piece of information I'd like to add to the 2012 data we shared with you a few weeks ago in New York has to do with the Distribution of our quarterly earnings. As you know, while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I can tell you that all of our projected 2012 earnings growth is reflected in the second half of the year. We don't expect the first and second quarters of 2012 to look materially different from 2011, with the first quarter slightly higher and second quarter slightly lower, assuming, of course, that all of our forecast assumptions are realized. Now let me turn things back over to Greg, who'll speak to 2012 and our active commitment to delivering strong and sustained earnings growth well beyond this year."

And just to recap, 2011 was one of the strongest years in our history, with record net income and we'd continue to benefit from the strong macro environment that supports our growing gas transmission business and is accelerating the growth of our gas processing business activities throughout North America. 
In early '07, we told you we'd grow earnings by investing about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses and attractive returns on capital in the 10% to 12% range. As you can see here, we're not only meeting that commitment, but we're here [ph]. We intend to continue that growth focus, and going forward, we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion through the end of the decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash growth, with robust returns in capital in that 10% to 12% range. And you can expect an additional $6 billion capital investment kicker from DCP, where returns will average in the mid to high teens. That's an impressive record of execution and, frankly, a menu of opportunity. 
The power of our portfolio is driven by a number of integrated elements: First, our expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage; our considerable financial strength and flexibility; multiple financing vehicles, be that C-Corps or MLPs or the partnerships that we belong to; our proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed; and finally, reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. Our confidence in our ability to continue being the investment opportunity of choice is grounded in the 125% total shareholder return that we provided investors over the last 3 years. We know how to create value and improvement. So with that, we'll turn things back over to John, and we'll open it up to take your questions."

So I don't see it -- if that was sustained over a very long period of time, obviously that would be a little bit more concerning. But then you see, Faisel, the big folks coming in and picking up these assets, right? I mean you're looking at Exelon coming in and I think during its earnings call earlier this week, it may declare plans to continue to drill out its program. And that's got us focused on the short term. So I don't see that as a big negative in the medium term, that's for sure. Low gas prices lead to much stronger demand, and that tends to fix itself there more than driving up the prices. So I think we're pretty careful from a credit perspective. We continue to be able to bring in projects like 2014. So I feel very good about the plans that we have in-date, the projects in execution to-date are going to work through any downtick here in natural gas prices in the short term. What we often forget, as an industry, that weather is a huge factor here and what I can tell you is if you turn to the DCP business, it's really not about $2 or $3 or $4 gas, it's about the liquids, and the places where we are in the Permian, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, those places are going to get drilled out at $2, $3, $4 gas because you're really going after liquids."

And so the guys up there have a task of going up there and getting more and more volume, and that's what they've been able to do. They did that in 2011, I expect they'd do it in '12.

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doin",903,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doing so. With respect to the fourth quarter, I'm aware that the outcome was lower than some of you had estimated, and while Pat will take you through the details, I thought it'd be worthwhile to speak to some of the unusual items and unique timing of some of those items as context for the quarter. 
In the quarter, we booked a number of items that reduced income. They were associated with , 1, software amortization; 2, employee benefits; 3, acquisition-related settlements; 4, captive insurance claims; and 5, some tax adjustments. In total, these items weighed on earnings by about $0.03 a share. Added to these were NGL curtailments and plant reliability challenges that lowered DCPs earnings by about $0.01 this year. And then finally, with the warm start to the winter, we were able to do more plant maintenance work at U.S. Transmission and Union Gas, which increased O&M costs at those business units. Together, these items resulted in a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share, and represented an accumulation of relatively small items that either would not typically cluster in a single quarter or, as in the case of NGL curtailments, are short lived, thanks to DCP's current investment in NGL pipelines and plant capacity. To the extent that any of these items may occur again in 2012, they've been taken into account in our guidance to you. 
So turning back now to the bigger picture and the overall year, as I mentioned, we finished the year with record net income. We indicated that we expected to exceed our ongoing EPS target of $1.65 for the year, and we did, delivering earnings per share of $1.77. In support of that achievement, each of our business segments delivered nice EBIT increases for the year. We're benefiting from changing market fundamentals that support our growing Gas Transmission business and our Gas Processing and Distribution business throughout North America. As we look back on the year, we saw a healthy pickup at DCP from favorable NGL pricing. But as a result of the curtailments I've previously mentioned and the effects of winter storms that you'll recall early in 2011, as well as plant reliability challenges, we didn't realize all of that pickup. Fortunately, the new infrastructure being built at DCP, such as Southern Hills and Sand Hills, will ensure that we do unlock our growing NGL volumes and reach premium pricing markets such as Mont Belvieu. 
Despite that Q4 curtailment issues I mentioned, DCP's year-end NGL production volumes were 6% above fourth quarter 2010 levels. During the year, U.S. Transmission grew its ongoing EBIT by approximately 5%, as it realized earnings from new projects brought into service. U.S. Transmission continues on a stable track. While we have growth in both 2012 and 2013 EBIT in this business unit, we expect the next significant growth in its EBIT to occur when we realize the full year benefits of our New Jersey - New York project in 2014. 
In Western Canada, in spite of higher extraction premiums, our Empress NGL business experienced strong sales volumes relative to our initial expectations. We've provided a healthy boost to Western Canadian Transmission & Processing. And despite a warm start to the 2011, 2012 winter and a sluggish Ontario economy, our gas utility, Union Gas, grew its EBIT by almost 4%. The point of all of this is the power of Spectra Energy's entire portfolio allows us to perform consistently, growing earnings and the dividend, even in the face of various market cycles and operational scenarios. 
Turning to the dividend, during 2011, we increased it by about 8% and we have the confidence in our growth plans to commit to delivering annual dividend growth of at least $0.08 per year on an ongoing basis. We invested more than $1 billion in capital expansion during the year and placed 6 projects in the service. Successful execution of our CapEx plan allows us to continue to achieve aggregate returns on capital employed, in excess of our targeted 10% to 12%. 
In addition to the organic growth and expansions, we executed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. We acquired the Big Sandy Pipeline in Eastern Kentucky to our MLP Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream acquired Southern Hills Pipeline, targeting new NGL transportation capacity from the mid-Continent to the premium Gulf Coast market. Our share of DCP cash distributions was about $400 million in 2011, exceeding our initial expectations by almost $50 million, and we expect distributions to continue increasing as DCP grows its earnings. In fact, for 2012, we should receive distributions from DCP of $460 million, 15% higher than in 2011. And we committed to look forward positioning ourselves strategically, leveraging our enviable asset position and seeking accretive capital investment such as recently announced TEAM 2014, open and next opportunities. Overall, we continue to have a balanced approach to serving our investors through both earnings and dividend growth, and we have the flexibility to toggle between the 2 to ensure consistent level of total shareholder return through all market cycles. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide detail for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings",1262,"Well, thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings of $287 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the year, we delivered record ongoing earnings of about $1.16 billion or $1.77 per share. The annual results reflect solid performance from all of our businesses. In particular, we benefited from expansion projects placed into service, higher commodity prices at DCP and a stronger Canadian dollar. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA. For the year, EBITDA increased by almost 9%, from about $3 billion in 2010 to more than $3.3 billion in 2011. And as you may recall from our Analyst Day last month, our 2012 EBITDA is budgeted at $3.5 billion, up another 6%. So strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allows us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while maintaining a solid BBB balance sheet. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with U.S. Transmission, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $226 million, compared with $237 million in 2010. The 2011 quarter reflects higher operating costs and as expected, lower revenues at Ozark Gas Transmission. These results were partially offset by incremental earnings from our expansion projects.  For the full year, ongoing EBIT for U.S. Transmission increased nearly 5% from $938 million in 2010 to $983 million in 2011. 
Now let's turn to Distribution, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $120 million, compared with $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease is primarily due to lower customer usage related to weather that was nearly 15% warmer than the prior year. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Distribution increased almost 4% from $409 million in 2010 to $425 million in 2011. 
Let's focus now on results that are Western Canada Transmission & Processing business, which reported ongoing fourth quarter 2011 EBIT of $137 million, compared with $131 million in the fourth quarter 2010. This segment benefited from improved results in the gathering and processing business, driven primarily by higher earnings from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. These results were partially offset by lower earnings at the Empress NGL business, attributable mainly to significantly higher cost of NGL extraction, net of higher sales prices. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $510 million, compared with $409 million in 2010, representing an increase of nearly 25%. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which, as you know, represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services reported fourth quarter EBIT of $96 million, compared with $108 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The 2011 quarter results reflect the effects of plant higher operating costs, short-term reliability issues and NGL curtailments, primarily occurring in the Permian Basin. We also recorded lower gains associated with the sale of common units by DPM. These results more than offset the benefit seen from increased NGL prices and volume growth, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. As Greg told you, the curtailment issues encountered last year further underscore the critical need for DCP's Sand Hills Pipeline, which will play a key role in opening up the flow of NGLs to premium Gulf Coast markets, particularly from processing plants located in the Permian. 
On average, NGL prices were $0.14 per gallon higher this quarter, compared with 2010. NYMEX natural gas averaged $0.25 lower in 2011 and crude oil was $9 higher per barrel. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Field Services was $449 million, compared with $335 million in 2010, representing a 34% increase. And as previously mentioned, DCP Midstream paid distributions to us of $395 million for the year, exceeding our target of $350 million. 
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of our corporate governance costs and captive insurance and some additional items. Other reported net costs of $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with ongoing net cost of $16 million in 2010. The unfavorable variance reflects higher captive insurance cost from miscellaneous loss events and other corporate expenses. Year-end net cost for Other were $104 million, compared with $62 million in 2010. Higher self-insured insurance losses, benefit costs and similar corporate expenses account for the variance. Our ongoing annual run rate for corporate other costs should be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and is reflected at that level in our 2012 earnings guidance. Additional items affecting net income include: Interest expense for the quarter of $154 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter 2011 ongoing income tax expense from continuing operations of $115 million compared to the $128 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 56%. Going forward, we expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while maintaining strong investment grade coverage ratios. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In other words, more than adequate to supplement our internally generated cash. 
So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, now let's take a look at how we reconcile our 2011 actual performance to our 2012 plan. As we look forward to 2012, let's begin with the actual 2011 ongoing net income of about $1.16 billion, which supports our $1.77 earnings per share, and compare that to our 2012 projected net income of about $1.24 billion or $1.90 per share. You can see that the ongoing successful execution of our expansion program will be the largest single contributor to earnings growth with $125 million of incremental EBIT expected in 2012. The split on each earnings will be about 60% from Western Canada and 40% from our U.S. Transmission operations. We also expect a significant contribution from DCP Midstream's expansion efforts and slightly higher commodity prices. 
As we've mentioned previously, we continue to see volume declines in the conventional areas of British Columbia, as a result of low gas prices. With lower contracted volumes in these areas, Western Canada is expecting a negative $65 million earnings effect in 2012. Also as expected, storage margins continue to be soft, resulting in a storage EBIT reduction of about $30 million, with about 3/4 of that coming from U.S. Transmission and 1/4 from Distribution. Our plan calls for slightly higher interest expense, primarily as a result of higher debt balances associated with funding our growth CapEx. And, of course, the $30 million tax effect is a result of the earnings change as shown here. One supplemental piece of information I'd like to add to the 2012 data we shared with you a few weeks ago in New York has to do with the Distribution of our quarterly earnings. As you know, while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I can tell you that all of our projected 2012 earnings growth is reflected in the second half of the year. We don't expect the first and second quarters of 2012 to look materially different from 2011, with the first quarter slightly higher and second quarter slightly lower, assuming, of course, that all of our forecast assumptions are realized. Now let me turn things back over to Greg, who'll speak to 2012 and our active commitment to delivering strong and sustained earnings growth well beyond this year."

And just to recap, 2011 was one of the strongest years in our history, with record net income and we'd continue to benefit from the strong macro environment that supports our growing gas transmission business and is accelerating the growth of our gas processing business activities throughout North America. 
In early '07, we told you we'd grow earnings by investing about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses and attractive returns on capital in the 10% to 12% range. As you can see here, we're not only meeting that commitment, but we're here [ph]. We intend to continue that growth focus, and going forward, we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion through the end of the decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash growth, with robust returns in capital in that 10% to 12% range. And you can expect an additional $6 billion capital investment kicker from DCP, where returns will average in the mid to high teens. That's an impressive record of execution and, frankly, a menu of opportunity. 
The power of our portfolio is driven by a number of integrated elements: First, our expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage; our considerable financial strength and flexibility; multiple financing vehicles, be that C-Corps or MLPs or the partnerships that we belong to; our proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed; and finally, reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. Our confidence in our ability to continue being the investment opportunity of choice is grounded in the 125% total shareholder return that we provided investors over the last 3 years. We know how to create value and improvement. So with that, we'll turn things back over to John, and we'll open it up to take your questions."

So I don't see it -- if that was sustained over a very long period of time, obviously that would be a little bit more concerning. But then you see, Faisel, the big folks coming in and picking up these assets, right? I mean you're looking at Exelon coming in and I think during its earnings call earlier this week, it may declare plans to continue to drill out its program. And that's got us focused on the short term. So I don't see that as a big negative in the medium term, that's for sure. Low gas prices lead to much stronger demand, and that tends to fix itself there more than driving up the prices. So I think we're pretty careful from a credit perspective. We continue to be able to bring in projects like 2014. So I feel very good about the plans that we have in-date, the projects in execution to-date are going to work through any downtick here in natural gas prices in the short term. What we often forget, as an industry, that weather is a huge factor here and what I can tell you is if you turn to the DCP business, it's really not about $2 or $3 or $4 gas, it's about the liquids, and the places where we are in the Permian, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, those places are going to get drilled out at $2, $3, $4 gas because you're really going after liquids."

You're talking about $600 million, $700 million worth of projects, of which I think, for 2010, the full year impact of those projects was about a $200 million, where the full year impact of the projects we brought in the U.S. this year would be more like $30 million or $40 million. So you're not -- it's kind of that issue of timing, so we brought in much bigger projects last year so -- and you got 2/10 or 2/12 last year, this year we're bringing in smaller projects and you get 2/12 of a smaller number.

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we released today our full year results for 2011, a year in which we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to you and realized net income in doing so. With respect to the fourth quarter, I'm aware that the outcome was lower than some of you had estimated, and while Pat will take you through the details, I thought it'd be worthwhile to speak to some of the unusual items and unique timing of some of those items as context for the quarter. 
In the quarter, we booked a number of items that reduced income. They were associated with , one, software amortization; two, employee benefits; three, acquisition-related settlements; four, captive insurance claims; and five, some tax adjustments. In total, these items weighed on earnings by about $0.03 a share. Added to these were NGL curtailments and plant reliability challenges that lowered DCPs earnings by about $0.01 this year. And then finally, with the warm start to the winter, we were able to do more plant maintenance work at U.S. Transmission and Union Gas, which increased O&M costs at those business units. Together, these items resulted in a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share, and  represented an accumulation of relatively small items that either would not typically cluster in a single quarter or, as in the case of NGL curtailments, are short lived, thanks to DCP's current investment in NGL pipelines and plant capacity. To the extent that any of these items may occur again in 2012, they've been taken into account in our guidance to you. 
So turning back now to the bigger picture and the overall year, as I mentioned, we finished the year with record net income. We indicated that we expected to exceed our ongoing EPS target of $1.65 for the year, and we did, delivering earnings per share of $1.77. In support of that achievement, each of our business segments delivered nice EBIT increases for the year. We're benefiting from changing market fundamentals that support our growing Gas Transmission business and our Gas Processing and Distribution business throughout North America. As we look back on the year, we saw a healthy pickup at DCP from favorable NGL pricing. But as a result of the curtailments I've previously mentioned and the effects of winter storms that you'll recall early in 2011, as well as plant reliability challenges, we didn't realize all of that pickup. Fortunately, the new infrastructure being built at DCP, such as Southern Hills and Sand Hills, will ensure that we do unlock our growing NGL volumes and reach premium pricing markets such as Mont Belvieu. 
Despite that Q4 curtailment issues I mentioned, DCP's year-end NGL production volumes were 6% above fourth quarter 2010 levels. During the year, U.S. Transmission grew its ongoing EBIT by approximately 5%, as it realized earnings from new projects brought into service. U.S. Transmission continues on a stable track. While we have growth in both 2012 and 2013 EBIT in this business unit, we expect the next significant growth in its EBIT to occur when we realize the full year benefits of our New Jersey - New York project in 2014. 
In Western Canada, in spite of higher extraction premiums, our Empress NGL business experienced strong sales volumes relative to our initial expectations. We've provided a healthy boost to Western Canadian Transmission & Processing. And despite a warm start to the 2011, 2012 winter and a sluggish Ontario economy, our gas utility, Union Gas, grew its EBIT by almost 4%. The point of all of this is the power of Spectra Energy's entire portfolio allows us to perform consistently, growing earnings and the dividend, even in the face of various market cycles and operational scenarios. 
Turning to the dividend, during 2011, we increased it by about 8% and we have the confidence in our growth plans to commit to delivering annual dividend growth of at least $0.08 per year on an ongoing basis. We invested more than $1 billion in capital expansion during the year and placed 6 projects in the service. Successful execution of our CapEx plan allows us to continue to achieve aggregate returns on capital employed, in excess of our targeted 10% to 12%. 
In addition to the organic growth and expansions, we executed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. We acquired the Big Sandy Pipeline in Eastern Kentucky to our MLP Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream acquired Southern Hills Pipeline, targeting new NGL transportation capacity from the mid-Continent to the premium Gulf Coast market. Our share of DCP cash distributions was about $400 million in 2011, exceeding our initial expectations by almost $50 million, and we expect distributions to continue increasing as DCP grows its earnings. In fact, for 2012, we should receive distributions from DCP of $460 million, 15% higher than in 2011. And we committed to look forward positioning ourselves strategically, leveraging our enviable asset position and seeking accretive capital investment such as recently announced TEAM 2014, open and next opportunities. Overall, we continue to have a balanced approach to serving our investors through both earnings and dividend growth, and we have the flexibility to toggle between the 2 to ensure consistent level of total shareholder return through all market cycles. With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide detail for the quarter."

It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings",1262,"Well, thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to report on our fourth quarter results and overall 2011 performance. As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy announced ongoing fourth quarter earnings of $287 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the year, we delivered record ongoing earnings of about $1.16 billion or $1.77 per share. The annual results reflect solid performance from all of our businesses. In particular, we benefited from expansion projects placed into service, higher commodity prices at DCP and a stronger Canadian dollar. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA. For the year, EBITDA increased by almost 9%, from about $3 billion in 2010 to more than $3.3 billion in 2011. And as you may recall from our Analyst Day last month, our 2012 EBITDA is budgeted at $3.5 billion, up another 6%. So strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allows us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while maintaining a solid BBB balance sheet. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with U.S. Transmission, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $226 million, compared with $237 million in 2010. The 2011 quarter reflects higher operating costs and as expected, lower revenues at Ozark Gas Transmission. These results were partially offset by incremental earnings from our expansion projects.  For the full year, ongoing EBIT for U.S. Transmission increased nearly 5% from $938 million in 2010 to $983 million in 2011. 
Now let's turn to Distribution, which reported ongoing fourth quarter EBIT of $120 million, compared with $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease is primarily due to lower customer usage related to weather that was nearly 15% warmer than the prior year. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Distribution increased almost 4% from $409 million in 2010 to $425 million in 2011. 
Let's focus now on results that are Western Canada Transmission & Processing business, which reported ongoing fourth quarter 2011 EBIT of $137 million, compared with $131 million in the fourth quarter 2010. This segment benefited from improved results in the gathering and processing business, driven primarily by higher earnings from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. These results were partially offset by lower earnings at the Empress NGL business, attributable mainly to significantly higher cost of NGL extraction, net of higher sales prices. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $510 million, compared with $409 million in 2010, representing an increase of nearly 25%. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which, as you know, represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services reported fourth quarter EBIT of $96 million, compared with $108 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The 2011 quarter results reflect the effects of plant higher operating costs, short-term reliability issues and NGL curtailments, primarily occurring in the Permian Basin. We also recorded lower gains associated with the sale of common units by DPM. These results more than offset the benefit seen from increased NGL prices and volume growth, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. As Greg told you, the curtailment issues encountered last year further underscore the critical need for DCP's Sand Hills Pipeline, which will play a key role in opening up the flow of NGLs to premium Gulf Coast markets, particularly from processing plants located in the Permian. 
On average, NGL prices were $0.14 per gallon higher this quarter, compared with 2010. NYMEX natural gas averaged $0.25 lower in 2011 and crude oil was $9 higher per barrel. Year-end ongoing EBIT for Field Services was $449 million, compared with $335 million in 2010, representing a 34% increase. And as previously mentioned, DCP Midstream paid distributions to us of $395 million for the year, exceeding our target of $350 million. 
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of our corporate governance costs and captive insurance and some additional items. Other reported net costs of $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with ongoing net cost of $16 million in 2010. The unfavorable variance reflects higher captive insurance cost from miscellaneous loss events and other corporate expenses. Year-end net cost for Other were $104 million, compared with $62 million in 2010. Higher self-insured insurance losses, benefit costs and similar corporate expenses account for the variance. Our ongoing annual run rate for corporate other costs should be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and is reflected at that level in our 2012 earnings guidance. Additional items affecting net income include: Interest expense for the quarter of $154 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter 2011 ongoing income tax expense from continuing operations of $115 million compared to the $128 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 56%. Going forward, we expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while maintaining strong investment grade coverage ratios. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In other words, more than adequate to supplement our internally generated cash. 
So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, now let's take a look at how we reconcile our 2011 actual performance to our 2012 plan. As we look forward to 2012, let's begin with the actual 2011 ongoing net income of about $1.16 billion, which supports our $1.77 earnings per share, and compare that to our 2012 projected net income of about $1.24 billion or $1.90 per share. You can see that the ongoing successful execution of our expansion program will be the largest single contributor to earnings growth with $125 million of incremental EBIT expected in 2012. The split on each earnings will be about 60% from Western Canada and 40% from our U.S. Transmission operations. We also expect a significant contribution from DCP Midstream's expansion efforts and slightly higher commodity prices. 
As we've mentioned previously, we continue to see volume declines in the conventional areas of British Columbia, as a result of low gas prices. With lower contracted volumes in these areas, Western Canada is expecting a negative $65 million earnings effect in 2012. Also as expected, storage margins continue to be soft, resulting in a storage EBIT reduction of about $30 million, with about 3/4 of that coming from U.S. Transmission and 1/4 from Distribution. Our plan calls for slightly higher interest expense, primarily as a result of higher debt balances associated with funding our growth CapEx. And, of course, the $30 million tax effect is a result of the earnings change as shown here. One supplemental piece of information I'd like to add to the 2012 data we shared with you a few weeks ago in New York has to do with the Distribution of our quarterly earnings. As you know, while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I can tell you that all of our projected 2012 earnings growth is reflected in the second half of the year. We don't expect the first and second quarters of 2012 to look materially different from 2011, with the first quarter slightly higher and second quarter slightly lower, assuming, of course, that all of our forecast assumptions are realized. Now let me turn things back over to Greg, who'll speak to 2012 and our active commitment to delivering strong and sustained earnings growth well beyond this year."

And just to recap, 2011 was one of the strongest years in our history, with record net income and we'd continue to benefit from the strong macro environment that supports our growing gas transmission business and is accelerating the growth of our gas processing business activities throughout North America. 
In early '07, we told you we'd grow earnings by investing about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses and attractive returns on capital in the 10% to 12% range. As you can see here, we're not only meeting that commitment, but we're here [ph]. We intend to continue that growth focus, and going forward, we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion through the end of the decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash growth, with robust returns in capital in that 10% to 12% range. And you can expect an additional $6 billion capital investment kicker from DCP, where returns will average in the mid to high teens. That's an impressive record of execution and, frankly, a menu of opportunity. 
The power of our portfolio is driven by a number of integrated elements: First, our expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage; our considerable financial strength and flexibility; multiple financing vehicles, be that C-Corps or MLPs or the partnerships that we belong to; our proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed; and finally, reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. Our confidence in our ability to continue being the investment opportunity of choice is grounded in the 125% total shareholder return that we provided investors over the last 3 years. We know how to create value and improvement. So with that, we'll turn things back over to John, and we'll open it up to take your questions."

If I think about some of the new projects, like we announced, TEAM 2014, the 2 anchor shippers that we signed up there are both very solid players as well. So I don't see it -- if that was sustained over a very long period of time, obviously that would be a little bit more concerning. But then you see, Faisel, the big folks coming in and picking up these assets, right? I mean you're looking at Exelon coming in and I think during its earnings call earlier this week, it may declare plans to continue to drill out its program. And that's got us focused on the short term. So I don't see that as a big negative in the medium term, that's for sure. Low gas prices lead to much stronger demand, and that tends to fix itself there more than driving up the prices. So I think we're pretty careful from a credit perspective. We continue to be able to bring in projects like 2014. So I feel very good about the plans that we have in-date, the projects in execution to-date are going to work through any downtick here in natural gas prices in the short term. What we often forget, as an industry, that weather is a huge factor here and what I can tell you is if you turn to the DCP business, it's really not about $2 or $3 or $4 gas, it's about the liquids, and the places where we are in the Permian, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, those places are going to get drilled out at $2, $3, $4 gas because you're really going after liquids."

So I guess the bottom line is that while we've seen a pullback from conventional, we've seen more than that decline outstripped by the new plays they're coming in. So -- excuse me. I haven't -- I guess the bottom line is we continued to see the growth far outstripping in decline, where people have laid rates down on the conventional side. And you're right, LNG is an opportunity out there as well. I don't know if you saw, but CNPC, I think, picked up a big piece of Shell's Montney play, today, that was announced. And so that's obviously a big player in a big element with respect to building out LNG on the West Coast of Canada."

So you're not -- it's kind of that issue of timing, so we brought in much bigger projects last year so -- and you got 2/10 or 2/12 last year, this year we're bringing in smaller projects and you get 2/12 of a smaller number.

A couple of key takeaways for you",1794,"Thanks very much, John. And good morning, everybody. As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy is off to a good start in 2012 delivering solid first quarter ongoing results of $3 million or $0.51 per share. A couple of key takeaways for you that I'm sure would come as no surprise, first, our results for the quarter were affected by much warmer than normal winter weather, historically warm, in fact. Union Gas experienced its warmest winter in more 100 years, which in turn lowered customer usage by almost 18%. Second, weaker commodity prices. Lower NGL and natural gas prices did adversely affect DCP Midstream's earnings and higher extraction premiums reduced margins at our Empress facility in Canada. Fortunately and positively, the effect of low commodity at DCP were more than offset by volume increases. DCPs NGL production increase by more than 15% quarter-over-quarter and gathering and processing throughput increased by almost 8%. With the exception of commodity prices and weather, earnings for the quarter were in line with or slightly ahead of our expectations and we continue to execute well on our business expansion plans.
The power of our diverse portfolio helped us manage through the effects of lower commodity prices and weather. And with the NGL prices typically lower in the first quarter of the year, and with facilities coming back online from outages and expectation of greater propane exports, we remain optimistic regarding NGL prices for the remainder of the year. That said however, at least through the day, the outlook for natural gas on its own, continues to looks a challenging as do deep extraction premiums at Embers. Nonetheless, we've got a good handle of things we can control and a proven track record of successfully navigating through the challenges and identifying and acting on opportunities.
Are continuing to execute on our expansion projects underway, and those on the drawing board. And as we've indicated to you before, we've got $3 billion in Spectra Energy finance expansion and more than $4 billion of DCP finance expansion in flood. Spectra Energy will drive additional value from the increasing distributions made by, DCP Midstream, a value that would be passed along to our investors. DCP Midstream is in a midst of a high-growth phase and continues to deliver attractive distributions to us and our partner, Phillips  66, our stakes and projects across the company including many at DCP Midstream will deliver a high level of fee-based growth to support ongoing earnings and dividend growth through various commodity and market cycles. Let's take a look at some of the Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream opportunities. Since we just returned from a trip to Asia in which we met with various parties about prospects for exporting liquefied natural gas or LNG from North America to international market, let's begin there. Whilst it's still definitely early in the process, LNG exports in British Columbia would be a game changer for that region. There's a great window of opportunity for the construction of pipelines, from the suppliers, to export terminal locations. And we've giving our excellent BC assets move our position to participate in the necessary infrastructure growth. We would like to build at least one of the pipelines to the west coast of BC, but we also see great opportunities in the higher returning upstream gathering and processing investments that will be required if the export market develops. That's an opportunity for us to further expand our impressive fee-based gathering and processing network in Western Canada. Of course, Texas Eastern is well situated to serve Gulf Coast LNG export terminals. Our existing pipeline infrastructure will ensure we will gain our fair share of Gulf Coast NLG opportunities as well over the coming years. Let's take a look at some of the other opportunities in the U.S. In response to both changing supplies and growing demand, Spectra Energy is pursuing an extraordinary suite of U.S. projects representing $2 billion to $4 billion of investment opportunities over the 2014 to 2017 timeframe. This in addition to the $3 billion of projects currently in execution. The projects are designed to connect a variety of growing supplier regions to the growing Midwest power market, premium Northeast and New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada and finally, both gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. This slide provides an update on 5 projects connected to the Marcellus and Utica basins, which further demonstrate our first mile and last mile competitive advantage. I won't go over these in detail but rather point a few highlights. We reached binding agreements with the 2 anchor shippers for 2014, Chevron and EQT. We expect to have this 600 million cubic feet a day project in service by the end of 2014. Our open project as is a committed anchor shipper, and we recently initiated an open season to further define the project scope. Our next project is an exciting opportunity in Ontario and the Quebec markets. Next is focus on connecting Utica and Marcellus producers directly to the Don storage Ontario and the growing Eastern Canadian local distribution and power markets. We have MOUs in place for an extra several customers. You may have seen our AIM project featured on the front page of the Boston Globe last week. The article described how AIM offers growing Northeast and New England markets access to abundant and inexpensive Marcellus gas, increases supply diversity, produces price volatility, providing greater supply security and hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for consumers. And earlier this year, we announced an open season for our Renaissance project, a new pipeline system that will link growing natural gas supplies in various basins to high demand power generation and distribution markets in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. We had a successful open season and expect to finalize commercial terms during the second half of the year. And let's not lose sight of the tremendous power conversion opportunities in Florida. As older coal and oil-fired fleets are converted to cleaner burning natural gas power generation. As you know, we have an existing footprint in Florida, which crosses the primary service areas of 3 investor-owned utilities in the state, which really gives us a strong competitive advantage. Now let's take a look at DCP Midstream, which is seeing significant volume growth particularly in liquids-rich, higher-margin regions like the Permian, Eagle Ford and the DJ Basin. DCP is also building a premier pipeline network to relieve NGL constraints and bottlenecks. This fee-based network is designed to deliver NGLs to the premium priced Gulf Coast markets. As you know, DCP Midstream is our 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, and we recently had our first board meeting with the Phillips 66 We've been working with them throughout the transition and continued to be fully aligned with the strong consensus view on DCP's growth plan and the utilization of BPM and the MLP. DCP Midstream is a top-tier processor and by a fairly wide and growing margin, the largest producer of natural gas liquids in North America. The business has an excellent existing NGL position concentrated in basins where NGL and crude fundamentals support active drilling today. It's important to recognize DCP's recent history of investment, which in turn drives gathering and processing throughput that NGL volume growth. Natural gas and NGL market dynamics provide DCP with tremendous CapEx investment opportunities, which we're actively pursuing. Those investments drive volume and earnings growth, and with DCP's $4 billion plus late projects in execution and at least another $2 billion on deck, it's clear to see that this positive momentum will continue to benefit Spectra Energy investors through the decade. Let's take a look at those projects that DCP has in execution.
Two of the major wide grade pipelines we've talked about before are under construction, and on target to be placed into service on time and on budget. Sand Hills Pipeline provides NGL transportation service from the Permian and the Eagle to Mount Belvieu, and we expect to complete the project's first phase during the second half of this year for Eagle Ford service, but Permian slows by the middle of 2013. Southern Hills Pipeline targets new NGL transportation capacity from the Midcontinent to Gulf Coast markets, and we expect to bring Southern Hills to service by mid-year 2013. Capacity for Southern Hills will be about 150,000 barrels per day. Now subject to approval from the board about DCP and DCP Midstream Partners, we would expect both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to ultimately reside within DCP Midstream Partners in the 2013 to 2014 timeframe. A couple of recently announced projects will add additional flexibility and incremental fee-based earnings to DCPs and their connected systems. The new Front Range pipeline being jointly developed by DCP Midstream, Enterprise and Anadarko [ph] will connect producers in the DJ Basin to reliable takeaway capacity and market access to the Gulf. Three weeks ago, DCP Midstream Partners acquired a 10% interest in Texas Express Pipeline. The pipeline will provide much-needed takeaway capacity for producers in the Rockies, Southern Oklahoma and the Midcontinent area given them access to the largest NGL market along the Gulf Coast and the opportunity to maximize the value of their NGLs. The quadrupling of NGL pipeline capacity from these 4 projects will result in significant fee-based earnings growth. In addition to these pipeline assets, DCP has announced plans to invest in more than 700 million cubic feet of new processing capacity and over 1,500 miles of new gathering infrastructure between 2011 and 2015. On Wednesday, you may have seen DCP Midstream announced capital investments underway in the Midcontinent including about $1 billion for the Southern Hills project I mentioned, and roughly another $1 billion for additional gathering and processing assets, which significantly enhance leading position in the area as the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas. And to increase its reach in liquids-rich production place like the Granite Wash, Woodford Cana and the Mississippi line. All of these growth projects will enhance DCP's asset portfolio to provide producers with an integrated liquids solution. So as you can see, Spectra Energy continues to create value by creating natural gas and its related products and services to growing markets. Our business plan and strategy remain solidly on track, and we're making good headwind in our project. We're expanding our pets a portfolio of assets and businesses, which would generate increasing levels of cash to reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And we continue to demonstrate our commitment in capacity on all those fronts through the various commodity and business cycles. So with that, let me turn the things over to Pat who will walk you through our first quarter financial performance."

As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $315 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million i",861,"Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $315 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million in the first quarter of 2011. Strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allow us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity while continuing to strengthen our capitalization ratios, maintain a solid balance sheet and grow our dividend. Let me take a look at our performance by business segment starting with U.S. Transmission. We reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $271 million, compared with $279 million last year. The 2012 quarter results reflect lower interruptible transportation revenue due to unusually warm weather compared with colder than normal weather in the first quarter of last year. The effects of expected contract reductions at our [ph] gas transmission and the acceleration of certain software amortization costs. These results were partially offset by expansion projects [ph] be replaced into service. Turning to distribution. That segment recorded first quarter EBIT of $151 million compared with $167 million in 2011. This decrease is almost entirely due to lower customer usage as a result of warmer than normal weather, the warmest in more than a century with 23% warmer than the same period last year. Lower operating field cost partially offset some of the decrease.
Our Western Canada Transmission & Processing business reported first quarter EBIT of $138 million compared with $141 million in 2011. This segment experienced improved results in the gathering and processing business primarily driven by higher revenues from the [ph] in the Horn River area of British Columbia. However, these results were offset by lower earnings at the Empress Natural Gas Liquids business. This reduction is due to lower NGL margins driven primarily by lower propane prices due to the warm weather and significantly higher extraction premiums. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services is enjoying great momentum from its growing slate of expansion projects. Field Services had a very  strong first quarter with EBIT of $93 million compared with $81 million in 2011. This EBIT increase reflects gas throughput that was 7% above last year and NGL production volumes that were up 15% in aggregate with especially strong growth in the Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ and Midcontinent areas. You'll recall that during the first quarter of last year, volumes have been significantly reduced due to severe weather. This segment did not experience volume reducing weather this year and in fact, its earnings for the quarter reflect higher volumes from expansion projects like Newborn and Roberts Ranch, which were placed into service in 2011.
The positive effect of these volume increases were partially offset by lower NGL and natural gas prices, which reduced our share of partnership earnings by $24 million in the quarter. As a reminder, almost 50% of DCP barrels are priced with Conway. DCP and its customers will benefit when Southern Hills is in service and release the current bottleneck between Conway and Mont Belvieu. With its $89 million cash distribution to Spectra Energy in the quarter, DCP Midstream continues its record of paying attractive partnership distributions to its owners. Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of corporate costs including benefits and captive insurance expense.
Other reported net positive $29 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net costs of $24 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense of $157 million compared to the $155 million last year. At the end of the first quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 55.6%. We expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while staying within our targeted 55% to 60% range for leverage. And at the quarter close, we had a total capacity under our credit facility of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $2 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. We feel good about where we are today and where we're headed in the future. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion to the end of this decade. That investment will allow growth with robust returns on capital. Our record is strong sustained and cash generation benefits ours investors. You expect continued an attractive dividend growth from Spectra Energy. We intend to grow our dividend by at least $0.08 a year, with upside potential to our 65% payout target. As you heard today, we're able to deliver value and growth across all market cycles because we have an expansive asset footprint featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage, we have considerable financial strength and flexibility enhanced by multiple financing vehicles, we have a proven track record of delivered attractive returns on capital employed and last but by no means least, we deliver reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open the lines and take your questions."

But people have to -- there's a couple of things we can't forget. One, traditionally and historically, the odds are that your first quarter is going to be weakest quarter on NGLs. Not every first quarter, but most of them. Secondly, inventories tend to peak in May, and then, those inventories are drawn down and that's driven by the fact you've got all the crackers and turnaround in the first quarter. This year, interestingly enough, a number of those turnarounds lasted longer than expected, and there were several that were unexpected. Williams, Eastman, they had downtime that they hadn't planned on. And then finally, you have the very warm winter that pushed down prices of propane, which obviously has an impact. All of those things I think you'll see turnaround as the year goes forward and you'll start to see a recovery in the natural gas prices, in the natural gas liquids prices as well. So at this point in time, I'm optimistic that those will turn around and obviously, whether we'll get to the $1.25 for the year average, we'll have see. But it's a little early to make that call."

We still have the ways to go there and I think that gives us some opportunity, which obviously we'll look at with the board later on in the year. With respect to DCP, I mean we're already refinancing both Southern Hills and Sand Hills, and we have typically taken back our -- taken back units for the proportion that we own. I will say DPM has put in its own funding capacity about $2 billion in the last year with a $1 billion capacity credit facility, and I would expect that access to market for the remainder of the equity. The real power of this as you well know is that basically the partners, Spectra and Phillips 66, through its ownership of DCP, will fund about a third of it, DPM will fund about 2/3 of this and yet the partners will realize about 50% of the earnings and cash flow. All of which will come out and in increased distributions to the parents. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think that's the right way to do it for DCP, and I think that will allow DPM to be able to manage that. You're going to use the cheapest cost of debt i.e. at DCP, and at least at this point in time, a cheaper cost of equity at DPM to be able to move those fee-based projects over."

And so, on that regard it committed seems like both the BC government is very supportive from multiple corridors whether it's Prince Rupert or at their sites, like [ph] in it seems like the federal government is trying in Canada is trying to accelerate the whole regulatory review process for that. So that's the nature of the 3 discussions and of course, obviously, we also talked about our position in the Gulf. And our ability to build header systems into any and all the LNG facilities there, and storage. And so, that's the general nature of the discussion. As I've said, I think it's still a couple of years away before FID is made on many of these projects. And so people are really in the due diligence mode, both from provider of services, microeconomic sides and whether you could actually get things built."

But again, that depends on if we get back to a normal overall year weather, that means you could see a very cold start to the winter in the fourth quarter and then that number is going to be lost. So we often, I know I often say this, but we really do often forget what a major impact weather does have across the entire value chain, and so we have see how that shakes out.

I think the very low tax base of side of things. There's no doubt you could take back some units, but that's going to much from a cash perspective. And we think as we said that we can grow the dividend at a very healthy rate. In the C corp type structure, it gives us the balance of being able to utilize what would be a cheaper cost of debt at the corporate side of things while still being able to use SCP equity on the growth side. And would you've seen us with assets such as Gulfstream and other singular assets, if you will, with higher basis, those been opportunities to drive [ph] and we'll look at continuing to do those. And then the other issue I was saying the next year, that is at least something that I think one has to consider is the whole issue of tax reform. And that's something that we're watching cautiously.

As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy is off to a good start in 2012 delivering solid first quarter ongoing results of $331 million or $0.51 per share. A couple of key takeaways for you that I'm sure will come as no surprise, first, our results for the quarter were affected by much warmer than normal winter weather, historically warm, in fact. Union Gas experienced its warmest winter in more than 100 years, which in turn lowered customer usage by almost 18%. Second, weaker commodity prices. Lower NGL and natural gas prices did adversely affect DCP Midstream's earnings and the higher extraction premiums reduced margins at our Empress facility in Canada. Fortunately and positively, the effect of low commodity prices at DCP were more than offset by volume increases. DCP's NGL production increased by more than 15% quarter-over-quarter and gathering and processing throughput increased by almost 8%. With the exception of commodity prices and weather, earnings for the quarter were in line with, or slightly ahead of, our expectations and we continue to execute well on our business expansion plans.
The power of our diverse portfolio helped us manage through the effects of lower commodity prices and weather. And with NGL prices typically lower in the first quarter of the year, and with TECO facilities coming back online from outages and the expectation of greater propane exports, we remain optimistic regarding NGL prices for the remainder of the year. That said however, at least through the day, the outlook for natural gas on its own, continues to looks challenging as do the steep extraction premiums at Empress. Nonetheless, we've got a good handle on things we can control and a proven track record of successfully navigating through the challenges and identifying and acting on opportunities.
We're continuing to execute on our impressive slate of expansion projects underway, and those on the drawing board. And as we've indicated to you before, we've got $3 billion in Spectra Energy-financed expansion and execution and more than $4 billion of DCP-financed expansion in flood. Spectra Energy will derive additional value from the increasing distributions made by DCP Midstream to its owners, a value that'll be passed along to our investors. DCP Midstream is in a midst of a high-growth phase and continues to deliver attractive distributions to us and our partner, Phillips 66. Our slates and projects across the company, including many at DCP Midstream, will deliver a high level of fee-based growth to support ongoing earnings and dividend growth through various commodity and market cycles. Let's take a look at some of the Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream opportunities. Since we just returned from a trip to Asia in which we met with various parties about prospects for exporting liquefied natural gas or LNG from North America to international market, let's begin there. While it's definitely still early in the process, LNG exports in British Columbia would be a game changer for that region. There's a great window of opportunity for the construction of pipelines, from the suppliers to export terminal locations. I mean given our excellent BC assets move our position to participate in the necessary infrastructure growth. We would like to build at least one of the pipelines to the West Coast to BC, but we also see great opportunities in the higher returning upstream gathering and processing investments that will be required if the export market develops. That's an opportunity for us to further expand our impressive fee-based gathering and processing network in Western Canada. Of course, Texas Eastern is well situated to serve Gulf Coast to LNG export terminals. Our existing pipeline infrastructure will ensure we gain our fair share of Gulf Coast LNG opportunities as well over the coming years. Let's take a look at some of the other opportunities in the U.S. In response to both changing supplies and growing demands, Spectra Energy is pursuing an extraordinary suite of U.S. projects representing $2 billion to $4 billion of investment opportunities over the 2014 to 2017 timeframe. These are in addition to the $3 billion of projects currently in execution. The projects are designed to connect a variety of growing supplier regions to the growing Midwest power market, premium Northeast to New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada and finally, both gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. This slide provides an update on 5 projects connected to the Marcellus and Utica basins, which further demonstrate our first mile and last mile competitive advantage. I won't go over these in detail but rather point a few highlights. We reached binding agreements with the 2 anchor shippers for 2014, Chevron and EQT. We expect to have this 600 million cubic feet a day project in service by the end of 2014. Our open project has AEP as a committed anchor shipper, and we recently initiated an open season to further define the project scope. Our next project is an exciting opportunity in Ontario and the Quebec markets. Next is focus on connecting Utica and Marcellus producers directly to the Dawn storage hub in Ontario and the growing Eastern Canadian local distribution and power markets. We have MOUs in place for our next several customers. You may have seen our AIM Project featured on the front page of the Boston Globe last week. The article described how AIM offers growing Northeast and New England markets, access to abundant and inexpensive Marcellus gas, increases supply diversity, produces price volatility, providing greater supply security and hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for consumers. And earlier this year, we announced an open season for our Renaissance project, a new pipeline system that will link growing natural gas supplies in various basins to high-demand power generation and distribution markets in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. We had a successful open season and expect to finalize commercial terms during the second half of the year. And let's not lose sight of the tremendous power conversion opportunities in Florida. As older coal and oil-fired fleets are converted to cleaner burning natural gas power generation. As you know, we have an existing footprint in Florida, which crosses the primary service areas of 3 investor-owned utilities in the state, which really gives us a strong competitive advantage. Now let's take a look at DCP Midstream, which is seeing significant volume growth particularly in liquids-rich, high-margin regions like the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the DJ Basin. DCP is also building a premier pipeline network to relieve NGL constraints and bottlenecks. This fee-based network is designed to deliver NGLs to the premium-priced Gulf Coast markets. As you know, DCP Midstream is our 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, and we recently had our first board meeting with the Phillips 66 change. We've been working with them throughout the transition and continued to be fully aligned with the strong consensus view on DCP's growth plan and the utilization of DPM and the MLP. DCP Midstream is a top-tier processor and by a fairly wide and growing margin, the largest producer of natural gas liquids in North America. The business has an excellent existing NGL position concentrated in basins where NGL and crude fundamentals support active drilling today. It's important to recognize DCP's recent history of investment, which in turn drives gathering and processing throughput and NGL volume growth. Natural gas and NGL market dynamics provide DCP with tremendous CapEx investment opportunities, which we're actively pursuing. Those investments drive volume and earnings growth, and with DCP's $4 billion-plus slate of projects in execution and at least another $2 billion on deck, it's clear to see that this positive momentum will continue to benefit Spectra Energy investors through the decade. Let's take a look at those projects that DCP has in execution.
Two of the major wide grade pipelines we've talked about before are under construction and on target to be placed into service on time and on budget. Sand Hills Pipeline provides NGL transportation service from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu. And we expect to complete the project's first phase during the second half of this year for Eagle Ford service, but Permian slows by the middle of 2013. Southern Hills Pipeline targets new NGL transportation capacity from the Midcontinent to Gulf Coast markets, and we expect to bring Southern Hills fully into service by mid-year 2013. Capacity for Southern Hills will be about 150,000 barrels per day. Now subject to approvals from the Board about DCP and DCP Midstream Partners, we would expect both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to ultimately reside within DCP Midstream Partners in the 2013 to 2014 time frame. A couple of recently announced projects will add additional flexibility and incremental fee-based earnings to DCP's and their connected systems. The new Front Range pipeline being jointly developed by DCP Midstream, Enterprise and Anadarko will connect producers in the DJ Basin to reliable takeaway capacity and a market access to the Gulf. Three weeks ago, DCP Midstream Partners acquired a 10% interest in Texas Express Pipeline. The pipeline will provide much needed takeaway capacity for producers in the Rockies, Southern Oklahoma and the Midcontinent area given them access to the largest NGL market along the Gulf Coast and the opportunity to maximize the value of their NGLs. The quadrupling of NGL pipeline capacity from these 4 projects will result in significant fee-based earnings growth. In addition to these pipeline assets, DCP has announced plans to invest in more than 700 million cubic feet a day of new processing capacity and over 1,500 miles of new gathering infrastructure between 2011 and 2015. And on Wednesday, you may have seen DCP Midstream announced capital investments underway in the Midcontinent including about $1 billion for the Southern Hills project I mentioned, and roughly another $1 billion for additional gathering and processing assets, which significantly enhance its leading position in the area as the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas. And to increase its reach in liquids-rich production place like the Granite Wash, Woodford-Cana and the Mississippi line. All of these growth projects will enhance DCP's asset portfolio to provide producers with an integrated liquids solution. So as you can see, Spectra Energy continues to create value by connecting natural gas and its related products and services to growing markets. Our business plan and strategy remain solidly on track, and we're making good headwind in our projects. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and businesses, which will generate increasing levels of cash to reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And we continue to demonstrate our commitment in capacity in all those fronts through the various commodity and business cycles. So with that, let me turn things over to Pat who will walk you through our first quarter financial performance."
610501,184273707,297957,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million i",861,"Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million in the first quarter of 2011. Strong earnings in cash generation from our mix of businesses allow us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity while continuing to strengthen our capitalization ratios, maintain a solid balance sheet and grow our dividend. Let me take a look at our performance by business segment. Starting with U.S. Transmission, we reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $271 million, compared with $279 million last year. The 2012 quarter results reflect lower interruptible transportation revenue due to unusually warm weather compared with a colder than normal weather in the first quarter of last year, the effects of expected contract reductions at Ozark Gas Transmission and the acceleration of certain software amortization costs. These results were partially offset by expansion projects previously placed into service. Turning to Distribution. That segment recorded first quarter EBIT of $151 million compared with $167 million in 2011. This decrease is almost entirely due to lower customer usage as a result of warmer than normal weather, the warmest in more than a century and 23% warmer than the same period last year. Lower operating fuel cost partially offset some of the decrease.
Our Western Canada Transmission & Processing business reported first quarter EBIT of $138 million compared with $141 million in 2011. This segment experienced improved results in the gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher revenues from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. However, these results were offset by lower earnings at the Empress natural gas liquids business. This reduction is due to lower NGL margins driven primarily by lower propane prices due to the warm weather and significantly higher extraction premiums. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services is enjoying great momentum from its growing slate of expansion projects. Field Services had a very strong first quarter with EBIT of $93 million compared with $81 million in 2011. This EBIT increase reflects gas throughput that was 7% above last year and NGL production volumes that were up 15% in aggregate, with a especially strong growth in the Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ and Midcontinent areas. You'll recall that during the first quarter of last year, volumes had been significantly reduced due to severe weather. This segment did not experience volume-reducing weather this year and in fact, its earnings for the quarter reflect higher volumes from expansion projects like Mewbourn and Roberts Ranch, which were placed into service in 2011.
The positive effects of these volume increases were partially offset by lower NGL and natural gas prices, which reduced our share of partnership earnings by $24 million in the quarter. As a reminder, almost 50% of DCP barrels are priced at Conway. DCP and its customers will benefit once Southern Hills is in service and release the current bottleneck between Conway and Mont Belvieu. With its $89 million cash distribution to Spectra Energy in the quarter, DCP Midstream continues its record of paying attractive partnership distributions to its owners. Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of corporate costs including benefits and captive insurance expense.
Other reported net positive $29 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net costs of $24 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense of $157 million compared to the $155 million last year. At the end of the first quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 55.6%. We expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while staying within our targeted 55% to 60% range for leverage. And at the quarter close, we have total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $2 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. We feel good about where we are today and where we're headed in the future. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion to the end of this decade. That investment will allow growth with robust returns on capital. Our record of strong, sustained [Audio Gap] in cash generation benefits our investors. You can expect continued and attractive dividend growth from Spectra Energy. We intend to grow our dividend by at least $0.08 a year, with upside potential to our 65% payout target. As you've heard today, we're able to deliver value and growth across all market cycles because we have an expansive asset footprint featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. We have considerable financial strength and flexibility enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. We have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed and last but by no means least, we deliver reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open the lines and take your questions."

So obviously, closing that is a big uplift for us. So I think given the amount of investment that we've seen just by doing Sand Hills and doing Southern Hills, I think you'll continue to see more pipelines be built. And there's some others with other faces as well. So I don't think by any stretch of the imagination this will be the end or that, that will be enough to close some of the delta that you see. It's also like Front Range and Texas Express  were important for us to be involved with this as well?"

But I think people have their -- there's a couple of things we can't forget. One, traditionally and historically, the odds are that your first quarter is going to be the weakest quarter on NGLs. Not every first quarter, but most of them. Secondly, inventories tend to peak in May, and then, those inventories are drawn down and that's driven by the fact you've got all the crackers and turnaround in the first quarter. This year, interestingly enough, a number of those turnarounds lasted longer than expected and there were several that were unexpected. Williams, Eastman, but they had downtime that they hadn't planned on. And then finally, you have the very warm winter that pushed down prices of propane, which obviously has an impact. All of those things I think you'll see turnaround as the year goes forward and you'll start to see a recovery in the natural gas prices, in the natural gas liquids prices as well. So at this point in time, I'm optimistic that those will turn around and obviously, whether we'll get to the $1.25 for the year average, we'll have to see. But it's a little early to make that call."

We still have aways to go there and I think that gives us some opportunity, which obviously we'll look at with the Board later on in the year. With respect to DCP, I mean we're already financing both Southern Hills and Sand Hills, and we have typically taken back our -- taken back units for the proportion that we own. I will say DPM has put in its own funding capacity of up to $2 billion in the last year with a $1 billion capacity credit facility, and I would expect they'd access to market for the remainder of the equity. The real power of this as you well know is that basically the partners, Spectra and Phillips 66, through its ownership of DCP, will fund about a third of it. DPM will fund about 2/3 of this and yet the partners will realize about 50% of the earnings and cash flow. All of which will come back in increased distributions to the parents. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think that's the right way to do it for DCP. And I think that'll allow DPM to be able to manage that. You're going to use the cheapest cost of debt i.e. at DCP. And at least at this point in time, a cheaper cost of equity at DPM to be able to move those fee-based projects over."

So first of all, just -- they want to know who the pipeline potential carriers are, us and others, the size of the pie, if you will, right down to kind of drawn pictures on maps, if you will, and how much that would cost. Two, they want to know our views and share their own views on what you think the pricing mechanism is. Is it typical JCC, or is it going to be something of NYMEX? Similar kind of discussions you would see in the Gulf. And then lastly, and this is an important one, and it's the political risk issue. Can you get projects permitted in a time that makes it relevant to the market? And so, on that regard it seems like both the BC, government is very supportive of multiple corridors whether it's Prince Rupert or at their sites, like Kitimat. And it seems like the federal government is trying, in Canada, is trying to accelerate the whole regulatory review process for that. So that's the nature of the 3 discussions and of course, obviously, we also talked about our position in the Gulf. And our ability to build header systems into any and all the LNG facilities there, and storage. And so, that's the general nature of the discussion. As I've said, I think it's still a couple of years away before FID [ph] is made on many of these projects.

If we thought there was a big value piece in there, that would be something that we'd look closer at. I think the very low tax base of side of things, there's no doubt you could take back some units, but that's not going to do much from a cash perspective. And we think, as we said, that we can grow the dividend at a very healthy rate. In the C corp-type structure, where it gives us the balance of being able to utilize what would be a cheaper cost of debt at the corporate side of things while still being able to use SEP equity on the growth side. I mean when you've seen us with assets such as Gulfstream and other singular assets, if you will, with higher basis, those been opportunities to drive and we'll look at continuing to do those. And then the other issue I will say in the next year, that is at least something that I think one has to consider, is the whole issue of tax reform. And that's something that we're watching cautiously. We've seen that happen in Canada where we had an MLP structure and then we saw corporate changes on that front that hurt the tax side of things.

You probably saw the article in the Wall Street Journal earlier in the week about how dramatically power generators have shifted to natural gas and away from coal in the last just a few months and that's the trend that continues to accelerate. So there is some upside of lower and stable gas prices for us."

A couple of key takeaways for y",1812,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy is off to a good start in 2012 delivering solid first quarter ongoing results of $331 million or $0.51 per share. A couple of key takeaways for you that I'm sure will come as no surprise, first, our results for the quarter were affected by much warmer than normal winter weather. Historically warm, in fact. Union Gas experienced its warmest winter in more than 100 years, which in turn lowered customer usage by almost 18%. Second, weaker commodity prices. Lower NGL and natural gas prices did adversely affect DCP Midstream's earnings and the higher extraction premiums reduced margins at our Empress facility in Canada. 
Fortunately and positively, the effect of low commodity prices at DCP were more than offset by volume increases. DCP's NGL production increased by more than 15% quarter-over-quarter and gathering and processing throughput increased by almost 8%. With the exception of commodity prices and weather, earnings for the quarter were in line with, or slightly ahead of, our expectations and we continue to execute well on our business expansion plans.
The power of our diverse portfolio helped us manage through the effects of lower commodity prices and weather. And with NGL prices typically lower in the first quarter of the year, and with pet-chem facilities coming back online from outages and the expectation of greater propane exports, we remain optimistic regarding NGL prices for the remainder of the year. That said however, at least through the day, the outlook for natural gas on its own continues to looks challenging as do the steep extraction premiums at Empress. Nonetheless, we've got a good handle on things we can control and a proven track record of successfully navigating through the challenges and identifying and acting on opportunities.
We're continuing to execute on our impressive slate of expansion projects underway, and those on the drawing board. And as we've indicated to you before, we've got $3 billion in Spectra Energy-financed expansion and execution and more than $4 billion of DCP-financed expansion in flood. Spectra Energy will derive additional value from the increasing distributions made by DCP Midstream to its owners, a value that'll be passed along to our investors. DCP Midstream is in the midst of a high-growth phase and continues to deliver attractive distributions to us and our partner, Phillips 66. Our expansion projects across the company, including many at DCP Midstream, will deliver a high level of fee-based growth to support ongoing earnings and dividend growth through various commodity and market cycles. 
Let's take a look at some of the Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream opportunities. Since we just returned from a trip to Asia in which we met with various parties about prospects for exporting liquefied natural gas or LNG from North America to international markets, let's begin there. While it's definitely still early in the process, LNG exports in British Columbia would be a game changer for that region. There's a great window of opportunity for the construction of pipelines from the suppliers to export terminal locations. I mean, given our excellent B.C. assets, we're well positioned to participate in the necessary infrastructure growth. We would like to build at least one of the pipelines to the west coast of B.C., but we also see great opportunities in the higher returning upstream gathering and processing investments that will be required as the export market develops. That's an opportunity for us to further expand our impressive fee-based gathering and processing network in Western Canada. Of course, Texas Eastern is well situated to serve Gulf Coast LNG export terminals. Our existing pipeline infrastructure will ensure we gain our fair share of Gulf Coast LNG opportunities as well over the coming years. 
Now let's take a look at some of the other opportunities in the U.S. In response to both changing supplies and growing demands, Spectra Energy is pursuing an extraordinary suite of U.S. projects representing $2 billion to $4 billion of investment opportunities over the 2014 to 2017 time frame. These are in addition to the $3 billion of projects currently in execution. The projects are designed to connect a variety of growing supplier regions to the growing Midwest power market, premium Northeast and New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada and finally, both gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. 
This slide provides an update on 5 projects connected to the Marcellus and Utica basins, which further demonstrate our first mile and last mile competitive advantage. I won't go over these in detail but rather point a few highlights. We reached binding agreements with the 2 anchor shippers for 2014, Chevron and EQT. We expect to have this 600 million cubic feet a day project in service by the end of 2014. Our open project has AEP as a committed anchor shipper, and we recently initiated an open season to further define the project scope. Our next project is an exciting opportunity in Ontario and the Quebec markets. 
Next is focused on connecting Utica and Marcellus producers directly to the Dawn storage hub in Ontario and the growing Eastern Canadian local distribution and power markets. We have MOUs in place for our next several customers. You may have seen our AIM Project featured on the front page of the Boston Globe last week. The article described how AIM offers growing Northeast and New England markets access to abundant and inexpensive Marcellus gas, increases supply diversity, produces price volatility, providing greater supply security and hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for consumers. And earlier this year, we announced an open season for our Renaissance project, a new pipeline system that will link growing natural gas supplies in various basins to high-demand power generation and distribution markets in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. 
We had a successful open season and expect to finalize commercial terms during the second half of the year. And let's not lose sight of the tremendous power conversion opportunities in Florida as older coal and oil-fired fleets are converted to cleaner burning natural gas power generation. As you know, we have an existing footprint in Florida which crosses the primary service areas of 3 investor-owned utilities in the state, which really gives us a strong competitive advantage. 
Now let's take a look at DCP Midstream, which is seeing significant volume growth particularly in the liquids-rich, high-margin regions like the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the DJ Basin. DCP is also building a premier pipeline network to relieve NGL constraints and bottlenecks. This fee-based network is designed to deliver NGLs to the premium-priced Gulf Coast markets. As you know, DCP Midstream is our 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, and we recently had our first board meeting with the Phillips 66 change. We've been working with them throughout the transition and continued to be fully aligned with the strong consensus view on DCP's growth plan and the utilization of DPM and the MLP. DCP Midstream is a top-tier processor and by a fairly wide and growing margin, the largest producer of natural gas liquids in North America. The business has an excellent existing NGL position concentrated in basins where NGL and crude fundamentals support active drilling today. 
It's important to recognize DCP's recent history of investment, which in turn drives gathering and processing throughput and NGL volume growth. Natural gas and NGL market dynamics provide DCP with tremendous CapEx investment opportunities, which we're actively pursuing. Those investments drive volume and earnings growth, and with DCP's $4 billion-plus slate of projects in execution and at least another $2 billion on deck, it's clear to see that this positive momentum will continue to benefit Spectra Energy investors through the decade. 
Let's take a look at those projects that DCP has in execution. Two of the major wide grade pipelines we've talked about before are under construction and on target to be placed into service on time and on budget. Sand Hills Pipeline provides NGL transportation service from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu. And we expect to complete the project's first phase during the second half of this year for Eagle Ford service, but Permian slows by the middle of 2013. Southern Hills Pipeline targets new NGL transportation capacity from the Midcontinent to Gulf Coast markets, and we expect to bring Southern Hills fully into service by mid-year 2013. Capacity for Southern Hills will be about 150,000 barrels per day. 
Now subject to approvals from the boards of both DCP and DCP Midstream Partners, we would expect both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to ultimately reside within DCP Midstream Partners in the 2013 to 2014 time frame. A couple of recently announced projects will add additional flexibility and incremental fee-based earnings to DCP's interconnected system. The new Front Range pipeline being jointly developed by DCP Midstream, Enterprise and Anadarko will connect producers in the DJ Basin to reliable takeaway capacity and a market access to the Gulf. 
Three weeks ago, DCP Midstream Partners acquired a 10% interest in Texas Express Pipeline. The pipeline will provide much needed takeaway capacity for producers in the Rockies, Southern Oklahoma and the Midcontinent area given them access to the largest NGL market along the Gulf Coast and the opportunity to maximize the value of their NGLs. The quadrupling of NGL pipeline capacity from these 4 projects will result in significant fee-based earnings growth. In addition to these pipeline assets, DCP has announced plans to invest in more than 700 million cubic feet a day of new processing capacity and over 1,500 miles of new gathering infrastructure between 2011 and 2015. 
And on Wednesday, you may have seen DCP Midstream announced capital investments underway in the Midcontinent, including about $1 billion for the Southern Hills project I mentioned, and roughly another $1 billion for additional gathering and processing assets which significantly enhance its leading position in the area as the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas. And to increase its reach in liquids-rich production place like the Granite Wash, Woodford-Cana and the Mississippi line. All of these growth projects will enhance DCP's asset portfolio to provide producers with an integrated liquids solution. 
So as you can see, Spectra Energy continues to create value by connecting natural gas and its related products and services to growing markets. Our business plan and strategy remain solidly on track, and we're making good headwind in our projects. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and businesses, which will generate increasing levels of cash to reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And we continue to demonstrate our commitment and capacity on all those fronts through the various commodity and business cycles. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Pat who will walk you through our first quarter financial performance."
610501,184273707,298380,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million i",855,"Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million in the first quarter of 2011. Strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allow us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while continuing to strengthen our capitalization ratios, maintain a solid balance sheet and grow our dividend. 
Let's take a look at our performance by business segment, starting with U.S. Transmission. We reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $271 million, compared with $279 million last year. The 2012 quarter results reflect lower interruptible transportation revenue due to unusually warm weather compared with colder than normal weather in the first quarter of last year, the effects of expected contract reductions at Ozark Gas Transmission and the acceleration of certain software amortization costs. These results were partially offset by expansion projects previously placed into service. 
Turning to Distribution. That segment recorded first quarter EBIT of $151 million compared with $167 million in 2011. This decrease is almost entirely due to lower customer usage as a result of warmer than normal weather, the warmest in more than a century and 23% warmer than the same period last year. Lower operating fuel cost partially offset some of the decrease.
Our Western Canada Transmission & Processing business reported first quarter EBIT of $138 million compared with $141 million in 2011. This segment experienced improved results in the gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher revenues from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. However, these results were offset by lower earnings at the Empress natural gas liquids business. This reduction is due to lower NGL margins driven primarily by lower propane prices due to the warm weather and significantly higher extraction premiums. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services is enjoying great momentum from its growing slate of expansion projects. Field Services had a very strong first quarter with EBIT of $93 million compared with $81 million in 2011. This EBIT increase reflects gas throughput that was 7% above last year and NGL production volumes that were up 15% in aggregate, with especially strong growth in the Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ and Midcontinent areas. You'll recall that during the first quarter of last year, volumes had been significantly reduced due to severe weather. This segment did not experience volume-reducing weather this year and in fact, its earnings for the quarter reflect higher volumes from expansion projects like Mewbourne and Roberts Ranch, which were placed into service in 2011.
The positive effects of these volume increases were partially offset by lower NGL and natural gas prices, which reduced our share of partnership earnings by $24 million in the quarter. As a reminder, almost 50% of DCP barrels are priced at Conway. DCP and its customers will benefit once Southern Hills is in service and relieves the current bottleneck between Conway and Mont Belvieu. With its $89 million cash distribution to Spectra Energy in the quarter, DCP Midstream continues its record of paying attractive partnership distributions to its owners. 
Now let me turn to other, which is primarily comprised of corporate costs including benefits and captive insurance expense. Other reported net costs of $29 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net costs of $24 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was $157 million compared with $155 million last year. At the end of the first quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 55.6%. We expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while staying within our targeted 55% to 60% range for leverage. And at the quarter's close, we have total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $2 billion. 
So that's an overview of our first quarter results. We feel good about where we are today and where we're headed in the future. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion to the end of this decade. That investment will allow growth with robust returns on capital. Our record of strong, sustained cash generation benefits our investors. You can expect continued and attractive dividend growth from Spectra Energy. We intend to grow our dividend by at least $0.08 a year, with upside potential to our 65% payout target. 
As you've heard today, we're able to deliver value and growth across all market cycles because we have an expansive asset footprint featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. We have considerable financial strength and flexibility enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. We have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed. And last but by no means least, we deliver reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. 
So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open the lines and take your questions."

Not every first quarter, but most of them. Secondly, inventories tend to peak in May, and then those inventories are drawn down. And that's driven by the fact you've got all the crackers and turnaround in the first quarter. This year, interestingly enough, a number of those turnarounds lasted longer than expected and there were several that were unexpected, Williams, Eastman, but they had downtime that they hadn't planned on. And then finally, you had the very warm winter that pushed down prices of propane, which obviously has an impact. All of those things I think you'll see turn around as the year goes forward and you'll start to see a recovery in the natural gas prices, in the natural gas liquids prices as well. So at this point in time, I'm optimistic that those will turn around and obviously, whether we'll get to the $1.25 for the year average, we'll have to see.

And I think that gives us some opportunity, which obviously we'll look at with the board later on in the year. With respect to DCP, I mean, we're already financing both Southern Hills and Sand Hills, and we have typically taken back our -- taken back units for the proportion that we own. I will say DPM has put in its own funding capacity of up to $2 billion in the last year, with a $1 billion capacity and credit facility, and I would expect they'd access to market for the remainder of the equity. The real power of this, as you well know, is that basically the partners, Spectra and Phillips 66 through its ownership of DCP, will fund about 1/3 of it. DPM will fund about 2/3 of this and yet the partners will realize about 50% of the earnings and cash flow, all of which will come back in increased distributions to the parents. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think that's the right way to do it for DCP. And I think that'll allow DPM to be able to manage that. You're going to use the cheapest cost of debt i.e. at DCP, and at least at this point in time, a cheaper cost of equity at DPM to be able to move those fee-based projects over."

One -- and when we go over there, we see everybody from the trade houses to utilities, and this is the first trip that I personally had been on, and also, investors, frankly. And the issues are probably threefold. So first of all, just -- they want to know who the pipeline potential carriers are, us and others, the size of the pie, if you will, right down to kind of drawing pictures on maps, if you will, and how much that would cost. Two, they want to know our views and share their own views on what you think the pricing mechanism is. Is it typical JCC, or is it going to be something off NYMEX? Similar kind of discussions you would see in the Gulf. And then lastly, and this is an important one, and it's a political risk issue. Can you get projects permitted in a time that makes it relevant to the market? And so, on that regard it seems like both the B.C. government is very supportive of multiple corridors whether it's Prince Rupert or other sites like Kitimat. And it seems like the federal government is trying, in Canada, is trying to accelerate the whole regulatory review process for that. So that's the nature of the 3 discussions. And of course, obviously, we also talked about our position in the Gulf and our ability to build header systems into any and all the LNG facilities there, and storage. And so, that's the general nature of the discussion. As I've said, I think it's still a couple of years away before FID is made on many of these projects. And so people are really in a due diligence mode, both from provider of services, macroeconomic sides and whether you can actually get things built."

But again, that depends on if we get back to a normal overall year weather, that means you could see a very cold start to the winter in the fourth quarter, and then that number is going to be low. So we often -- I know I often say this, but we really do often forget what a major impact weather does have across the entire value chain. And so I'll have to see how that shakes out.

I think the biggest value increment is actually on the DCP, DPM side of things. Yes -- but there's no doubt -- look, I mean, we always look at these things. If we thought there was a big value piece in there, that would be something that we'd look closer at. I think the very low tax base of side of things, there's no doubt you could take back some units, but that's not going to do much from a cash perspective. And we think, as we've said, we can grow the dividend at a very healthy rate in the C corp-type structure, where it gives us the balance of being able to utilize what would be a cheaper cost of debt at the corporate side of things while still being able to use SEP equity on the growth side. I mean, when you've seen us with assets such as Gulfstream and other singular assets, if you will, with higher basis, those been opportunities to drop in and we'll look at continuing to do those. And then the other issue I will say in the next year, that is at least something that I think one has to consider is the whole issue of tax reform. And that's something that we're watching cautiously. We've seen that happen in Canada where we had an MLP structure and then we saw corporate changes on that front that hurt the tax side of things. So for now, the focus is really at DCP and moving those assets which will benefit us obviously into DPM. And they're building very large new pipelines on that front."

A couple of key takeaways for y",1812,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy is off to a good start in 2012 delivering solid first quarter ongoing results of $331 million or $0.51 per share. A couple of key takeaways for you that I'm sure will come as no surprise, first, our results for the quarter were affected by much warmer than normal winter weather. Historically warm, in fact. Union Gas experienced its warmest winter in more than 100 years, which in turn lowered customer usage by almost 18%. Second, weaker commodity prices. Lower NGL and natural gas prices did adversely affect DCP Midstream's earnings and the higher extraction premiums reduced margins at our Empress facility in Canada. 
Fortunately and positively, the effect of low commodity prices at DCP were more than offset by volume increases. DCP's NGL production increased by more than 15% quarter-over-quarter and gathering and processing throughput increased by almost 8%. With the exception of commodity prices and weather, earnings for the quarter were in line with, or slightly ahead of, our expectations and we continue to execute well on our business expansion plans.
The power of our diverse portfolio helped us manage through the effects of lower commodity prices and weather. And with NGL prices typically lower in the first quarter of the year, and with pet-chem facilities coming back online from outages and the expectation of greater propane exports, we remain optimistic regarding NGL prices for the remainder of the year. That said however, at least through the day, the outlook for natural gas on its own continues to looks challenging as do the steep extraction premiums at Empress. Nonetheless, we've got a good handle on things we can control and a proven track record of successfully navigating through the challenges and identifying and acting on opportunities.
We're continuing to execute on our impressive slate of expansion projects underway, and those on the drawing board. And as we've indicated to you before, we've got $3 billion in Spectra Energy-financed expansion and execution and more than $4 billion of DCP-financed expansion in flood. Spectra Energy will derive additional value from the increasing distributions made by DCP Midstream to its owners, a value that'll be passed along to our investors. DCP Midstream is in the midst of a high-growth phase and continues to deliver attractive distributions to us and our partner, Phillips 66. Our expansion projects across the company, including many at DCP Midstream, will deliver a high level of fee-based growth to support ongoing earnings and dividend growth through various commodity and market cycles. 
Let's take a look at some of the Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream opportunities. Since we just returned from a trip to Asia in which we met with various parties about prospects for exporting liquefied natural gas or LNG from North America to international markets, let's begin there. While it's definitely still early in the process, LNG exports in British Columbia would be a game changer for that region. There's a great window of opportunity for the construction of pipelines from the suppliers to export terminal locations. I mean, given our excellent B.C. assets, we're well positioned to participate in the necessary infrastructure growth. We would like to build at least one of the pipelines to the west coast of B.C., but we also see great opportunities in the higher returning upstream gathering and processing investments that will be required as the export market develops. That's an opportunity for us to further expand our impressive fee-based gathering and processing network in Western Canada. Of course, Texas Eastern is well situated to serve Gulf Coast LNG export terminals. Our existing pipeline infrastructure will ensure we gain our fair share of Gulf Coast LNG opportunities as well over the coming years. 
Now let's take a look at some of the other opportunities in the U.S. In response to both changing supplies and growing demands, Spectra Energy is pursuing an extraordinary suite of U.S. projects representing $2 billion to $4 billion of investment opportunities over the 2014 to 2017 time frame. These are in addition to the $3 billion of projects currently in execution. The projects are designed to connect a variety of growing supplier regions to the growing Midwest power market, premium Northeast and New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada and finally, both gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. 
This slide provides an update on 5 projects connected to the Marcellus and Utica basins, which further demonstrate our first mile and last mile competitive advantage. I won't go over these in detail but rather point a few highlights. We reached binding agreements with the 2 anchor shippers for 2014, Chevron and EQT. We expect to have this 600 million cubic feet a day project in service by the end of 2014. Our open project has AEP as a committed anchor shipper, and we recently initiated an open season to further define the project scope. Our next project is an exciting opportunity in Ontario and the Quebec markets. 
Next is focused on connecting Utica and Marcellus producers directly to the Dawn storage hub in Ontario and the growing Eastern Canadian local distribution and power markets. We have MOUs in place for our next several customers. You may have seen our AIM Project featured on the front page of the Boston Globe last week. The article described how AIM offers growing Northeast and New England markets access to abundant and inexpensive Marcellus gas, increases supply diversity, produces price volatility, providing greater supply security and hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for consumers. And earlier this year, we announced an open season for our Renaissance project, a new pipeline system that will link growing natural gas supplies in various basins to high-demand power generation and distribution markets in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. 
We had a successful open season and expect to finalize commercial terms during the second half of the year. And let's not lose sight of the tremendous power conversion opportunities in Florida as older coal and oil-fired fleets are converted to cleaner burning natural gas power generation. As you know, we have an existing footprint in Florida which crosses the primary service areas of 3 investor-owned utilities in the state, which really gives us a strong competitive advantage. 
Now let's take a look at DCP Midstream, which is seeing significant volume growth particularly in the liquids-rich, high-margin regions like the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the DJ Basin. DCP is also building a premier pipeline network to relieve NGL constraints and bottlenecks. This fee-based network is designed to deliver NGLs to the premium-priced Gulf Coast markets. As you know, DCP Midstream is our 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, and we recently had our first board meeting with the Phillips 66 change. We've been working with them throughout the transition and continued to be fully aligned with the strong consensus view on DCP's growth plan and the utilization of DPM and the MLP. DCP Midstream is a top-tier processor and by a fairly wide and growing margin, the largest producer of natural gas liquids in North America. The business has an excellent existing NGL position concentrated in basins where NGL and crude fundamentals support active drilling today. 
It's important to recognize DCP's recent history of investment, which in turn drives gathering and processing throughput and NGL volume growth. Natural gas and NGL market dynamics provide DCP with tremendous CapEx investment opportunities, which we're actively pursuing. Those investments drive volume and earnings growth, and with DCP's $4 billion-plus slate of projects in execution and at least another $2 billion on deck, it's clear to see that this positive momentum will continue to benefit Spectra Energy investors through the decade. 
Let's take a look at those projects that DCP has in execution. Two of the major wide grade pipelines we've talked about before are under construction and on target to be placed into service on time and on budget. Sand Hills Pipeline provides NGL transportation service from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu. And we expect to complete the project's first phase during the second half of this year for Eagle Ford service, but Permian slows by the middle of 2013. Southern Hills Pipeline targets new NGL transportation capacity from the Midcontinent to Gulf Coast markets, and we expect to bring Southern Hills fully into service by mid-year 2013. Capacity for Southern Hills will be about 150,000 barrels per day. 
Now subject to approvals from the boards of both DCP and DCP Midstream Partners, we would expect both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to ultimately reside within DCP Midstream Partners in the 2013 to 2014 time frame. A couple of recently announced projects will add additional flexibility and incremental fee-based earnings to DCP's interconnected system. The new Front Range pipeline being jointly developed by DCP Midstream, Enterprise and Anadarko will connect producers in the DJ Basin to reliable takeaway capacity and a market access to the Gulf. 
Three weeks ago, DCP Midstream Partners acquired a 10% interest in Texas Express Pipeline. The pipeline will provide much needed takeaway capacity for producers in the Rockies, Southern Oklahoma and the Midcontinent area given them access to the largest NGL market along the Gulf Coast and the opportunity to maximize the value of their NGLs. The quadrupling of NGL pipeline capacity from these 4 projects will result in significant fee-based earnings growth. In addition to these pipeline assets, DCP has announced plans to invest in more than 700 million cubic feet a day of new processing capacity and over 1,500 miles of new gathering infrastructure between 2011 and 2015. 
And on Wednesday, you may have seen DCP Midstream announced capital investments underway in the Midcontinent, including about $1 billion for the Southern Hills project I mentioned, and roughly another $1 billion for additional gathering and processing assets which significantly enhance its leading position in the area as the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas. And to increase its reach in liquids-rich production place like the Granite Wash, Woodford-Cana and the Mississippi line. All of these growth projects will enhance DCP's asset portfolio to provide producers with an integrated liquids solution. 
So as you can see, Spectra Energy continues to create value by connecting natural gas and its related products and services to growing markets. Our business plan and strategy remain solidly on track, and we're making good headwind in our projects. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and businesses, which will generate increasing levels of cash to reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And we continue to demonstrate our commitment and capacity on all those fronts through the various commodity and business cycles. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Pat who will walk you through our first quarter financial performance."
610501,184273707,299119,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million i",855,"Good morning. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing first quarter earnings of $331 million or $0.51 per share, compared with $350 million or $0.54 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $902 million compared with $904 million in the first quarter of 2011. Strong earnings and cash generation from our mix of businesses allow us to fund our sizable CapEx program with no need to issue equity, while continuing to strengthen our capitalization ratios, maintain a solid balance sheet and grow our dividend. 
Let's take a look at our performance by business segment, starting with U.S. Transmission. We reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $271 million, compared with $279 million last year. The 2012 quarter results reflect lower interruptible transportation revenue due to unusually warm weather compared with colder than normal weather in the first quarter of last year, the effects of expected contract reductions at Ozark Gas Transmission and the acceleration of certain software amortization costs. These results were partially offset by expansion projects previously placed into service. 
Turning to Distribution. That segment recorded first quarter EBIT of $151 million compared with $167 million in 2011. This decrease is almost entirely due to lower customer usage as a result of warmer than normal weather, the warmest in more than a century and 23% warmer than the same period last year. Lower operating fuel cost partially offset some of the decrease.
Our Western Canada Transmission & Processing business reported first quarter EBIT of $138 million compared with $141 million in 2011. This segment experienced improved results in the gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher revenues from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. However, these results were offset by lower earnings at the Empress natural gas liquids business. This reduction is due to lower NGL margins driven primarily by lower propane prices due to the warm weather and significantly higher extraction premiums. 
Now let me turn to our Field Services business, which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. Field Services is enjoying great momentum from its growing slate of expansion projects. Field Services had a very strong first quarter with EBIT of $93 million compared with $81 million in 2011. This EBIT increase reflects gas throughput that was 7% above last year and NGL production volumes that were up 15% in aggregate, with especially strong growth in the Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ and Midcontinent areas. You'll recall that during the first quarter of last year, volumes had been significantly reduced due to severe weather. This segment did not experience volume-reducing weather this year and in fact, its earnings for the quarter reflect higher volumes from expansion projects like Mewbourn and Roberts Ranch, which were placed into service in 2011.
The positive effects of these volume increases were partially offset by lower NGL and natural gas prices, which reduced our share of partnership earnings by $24 million in the quarter. As a reminder, almost 50% of DCP barrels are priced at Conway. DCP and its customers will benefit once Southern Hills is in service and relieves the current bottleneck between Conway and Mont Belvieu. With its $89 million cash distribution to Spectra Energy in the quarter, DCP Midstream continues its record of paying attractive partnership distributions to its owners. 
Now let me turn to other, which is primarily comprised of corporate costs including benefits and captive insurance expense. Other reported net costs of $29 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net costs of $24 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was $157 million compared with $155 million last year. At the end of the first quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 55.6%. We expect to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while staying within our targeted 55% to 60% range for leverage. And at the quarter's close, we have total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $2 billion. 
So that's an overview of our first quarter results. We feel good about where we are today and where we're headed in the future. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $15 billion to the end of this decade. That investment will allow growth with robust returns on capital. Our record of strong, sustained cash generation benefits our investors. You can expect continued and attractive dividend growth from Spectra Energy. We intend to grow our dividend by at least $0.08 a year, with upside potential to our 65% payout target. 
As you've heard today, we're able to deliver value and growth across all market cycles because we have an expansive asset footprint featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. We have considerable financial strength and flexibility enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. We have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed. And last but by no means least, we deliver reliable earnings and ongoing dividend growth. 
So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open the lines and take your questions."

And there's some others with other phases [ph] as well. So I don't think by any stretch of the imagination this will be the end or that that will be enough to close some of the delta that you see.

But I think people have there -- there's a couple of things we can't forget. One, traditionally and historically, the odds are that your first quarter is going to be the weakest quarter on NGLs. Not every first quarter, but most of them. Secondly, inventories tend to peak in May, and then those inventories are drawn down. And that's driven by the fact you've got all the crackers and turnaround in the first quarter. This year, interestingly enough, a number of those turnarounds lasted longer than expected and there were several that were unexpected, Williams, Eastman, but they had downtime that they hadn't planned on. And then finally, you had the very warm winter that pushed down prices of propane, which obviously has an impact. All of those things I think you'll see turn around as the year goes forward and you'll start to see a recovery in the natural gas prices, in the natural gas liquids prices as well. So at this point in time, I'm optimistic that those will turn around and obviously, whether we'll get to the $1.25 for the year average, we'll have to see. But it's a little early to make that call."

And I think that gives us some opportunity, which obviously we'll look at with the board later on in the year. With respect to DCP, I mean, we're already financing both Southern Hills and Sand Hills, and we have typically taken back our -- taken back units for the proportion that we own. I will say DPM has put in its own funding capacity of up to $2 billion in the last year, with a $1 billion capacity and credit facility, and I would expect they'd access to market for the remainder of the equity. The real power of this, as you well know, is that basically the partners, Spectra and Phillips 66 through its ownership of DCP, will fund about 1/3 of it. DPM will fund about 2/3 of this and yet the partners will realize about 50% of the earnings and cash flow, all of which will come back in increased distributions to the parents. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think that's the right way to do it for DCP. And I think that'll allow DPM to be able to manage that. You're going to use the cheapest cost of debt i.e. at DCP, and at least at this point in time, a cheaper cost of equity at DPM to be able to move those fee-based projects over."

One -- and when we go over there, we see everybody from the trade houses to utilities, and this is the first trip that I personally had been on, and also, investors, frankly.

Two, they want to know our views and share their own views on what you think the pricing mechanism is. Is it typical JCC, or is it going to be something off NYMEX? Similar kind of discussions you would see in the Gulf. And then lastly, and this is an important one, and it's a political risk issue. Can you get projects permitted in a time that makes it relevant to the market? And so, on that regard it seems like both the B.C. government is very supportive of multiple corridors whether it's Prince Rupert or other sites like Kitimat. And it seems like the federal government is trying, in Canada, is trying to accelerate the whole regulatory review process for that. So that's the nature of the 3 discussions. And of course, obviously, we also talked about our position in the Gulf and our ability to build header systems into any and all the LNG facilities there, and storage. And so, that's the general nature of the discussion. As I've said, I think it's still a couple of years away before FID is made on many of these projects.

I think the biggest value increment is actually on the DCP, DPM side of things. Yes -- but there's no doubt -- look, I mean, we always look at these things. If we thought there was a big value piece in there, that would be something that we'd look closer at. I think the very low tax base of side of things, there's no doubt you could take back some units, but that's not going to do much from a cash perspective. And we think, as we've said, we can grow the dividend at a very healthy rate in the C corp-type structure, where it gives us the balance of being able to utilize what would be a cheaper cost of debt at the corporate side of things while still being able to use SEP equity on the growth side. I mean, when you've seen us with assets such as Gulfstream and other singular assets, if you will, with higher basis, those been opportunities to drop in and we'll look at continuing to do those. And then the other issue I will say in the next year, that is at least something that I think one has to consider is the whole issue of tax reform. And that's something that we're watching cautiously. We've seen that happen in Canada where we had an MLP structure and then we saw corporate changes on that front that hurt the tax side of things. So for now, the focus is really at DCP and moving those assets which will benefit us obviously into DPM. And they're building very large new pipelines on that front."

As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy delivered second quarter ongoing results of $215 million or $0.33 per share. Like many in the sector, we felt the effects of weak commodity prices which were much lower than our original assumptions. Our Field Services segment experienced the most significant impact. However, lower propane prices also adversely affected our Empress plants in Western Canada. It was definitely a tough quarter for commodity prices. NGL prices dropped almost 40% from 2011. NYMEX natural gas almost average 50% lower and prices were weakened by a lower demand caused by Petchem outages, slower economic conditions, record warm winter weather and exceptionally dry summer affecting crop drying expectations.
Recently, we have seen an uptick in commodity prices off the low point about 6 weeks ago. But I think it's fair to say that it will take an extraordinary increase in NGL prices for the rest of the 2012 to be at the average level we projected at the begin of the year.
Pat will provide more details around our commodity price expectations just a few minutes but given the current and near-term commodity price environment, it's very unlikely we'll realize our $1.90 earnings per share target for 2012. Now that said, looking beyond the quarter to the longer-term, the NGL fundamentals remain very positive for our business. Crude oil remains expensive relative to NGLs, new demand sources in the petrochemical front are set to come into service mid-decade. The infrastructure bottlenecks that restrict our volumes and Conway pricing relative to Mont Belvieu should dissipate over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, propane should benefit from new export facilities starting late next year and early next. And we'll have to assume that we'll have abnormally warm winters and dry summers we've experienced are just that abnormal. All of these supports the long-term growth of the NGL business in North America and as largest producers of NGLs in the U.S. bodes very for Spectra Energy's NGL business. Importantly, our fee-based businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations and our expansion opportunities remains strong and growing.
And as we projected at the beginning of the year, we saw increased earnings from expansion projects at U.S. Transmission, Western Canada and Field Services during the second quarter. Our consistent fee-based earnings allowed us to deliver predictable steady dividend growth, regardless of the commodity cycles. And as we have indicated personally, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver at least an $0.08 increase in our annual dividend over the next several years. 
In support of our growing dividend, we had a solid roster of expansion projects, those are now in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy financed projects and more than $4 billion of DCP financed expansion projects. We also have a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing shareholder value. All of these underlines our expectations of investing up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. In the near term, our 2012 to '14 expansion projects are in execution and on track. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. I'll highlight a few of these. In Western Canada, we're in the home stretch to complete about $1.5 billion Horn River Montney investment program, a series of strategic expansion projects. The first phase of the Dawson processing plant is now in service and construction of Phase II is underway and expected to be completed by early 2013. The T-North pipeline expansion project provide additional takeaway capacity from the Horn River and Montney areas and is supported by long-term firm contracts with shippers. This project went into service in the second quarter. And our final project in this investment program is the Fort Nelson  North plant, which we expect to go online late this year. Also on track to go on to service in late 2012 is our $200 million TEAM 2012 project, designed to move Marcellus supplies from South Western Pennsylvania to markets in the Northeast. The project's fully subscribed by Range Resources and Chesapeake Utilities. And the next phase of our team project is the TEAM 2014 project. We have reached binding agreements with 2 anchor shippers, Chevron and EQT, for the project's full capacity. And we submitted our FERC prefiling in July. We expect to begin construction in early 2014 for the targeted in-service date of late 2014. Last month, we started the construction on the New Jersey New York expansion project, having received FERC approval in late June. And when this $1.2 billion project goes into service in the fourth quarter of 2013, it will provide much needed gas supply in economic benefits to the region. It will also create future opportunities for us in the area and annual EBITDA of about $110 million. A smaller project that you might not be aware of is the Powder Bay project which will serve on Ontario power plant being converted from coal to gas. This project is actually the first of an expected $300 million to $400 million slate of opportunities to our capture continued power generation conversions in Ontario. And as we earlier -- as we said earlier, DCP Midstream is moving forward with more than $4 billion of projects in execution, producing fee-based earnings growth by quadrupling its NGL pipeline capacity. DCP is making excellent progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. The Sand Hills Pipeline is designed to provide NGL transportation from the Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale region to the Gulf Coast. They will be phased into service, with the first phase about 65% complete already and scheduled to be in service from Eagle Ford to the Mont Belvieu area later this year. Right away, acquisition of material sourcing is substantially complete for the second phase from the Permian, which has a targeted in service date of the second half of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'd recall will provide NGL transportation from the Midcontinent to Mont Belvieu has a targeted in-service date of mid-'13. Rehabilitation work on the existing pipeline, which we purchased from ConocoPhillips on the fourth quarter 2011, is nearing completion and construction of more than 300 miles of new pipelines has been initiated. In addition to these NGL pipeline projects, DCP's also building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. It recently broke ground on 3 of these projects. The expansion of the National helium plant in the Midcon. The LaSalle Plant which will provide service to producers in the DJ Basin. And the Rawhide processing plant that will serve producers focus on the Wolfberry  production in the West Texas region of the Permian. As a reminder, DCP self funds its on growth, which of course is advantageous to Spectra Energy and its investors. 
As mentioned earlier, with our expansion projects and our development plans in the horizon, we see more than $20 billion in expansion projects and opportunities through the end of the decade. In U.S. Transmission, we're pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities, many of them including Next, Open, Aim and Renaissance will connect from Marcellus and Utica suppliers to diverse North American markets, including the Midwest power market premium, Northeast and New England markets, LDC and power generators in Eastern Canada, and gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. And we've got other opportunities across our systems as well. In Western Canada, we see about $4 billion to $6 billion in expansion projects through the decade. We're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports and in fact, we're in advanced negotiations to provide pipeline infrastructure to support the development of British Colombia LNG export projects. And DCP Midstream has another $2 billion to $3 billion in the development opportunities primarily in gathering and processing and NGL infrastructure. So as you can see, our business plan and strategy remains solidly on track. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and we're continuing to demonstrate our commitment and capacity and all fronts, through our various commodity and base business cycles. Rewarding investors with steady, reliable dividend growth. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will take you through our second quarter financial performance before we take your questions."

Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 milli",1017,"Well, thank you Greg and good morning, all. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing second quarter earnings of $215 million or $0.33 per share, compared with $275 million or $0.42 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 million compared with $816 million last year. As we've noted before, our ability to generate solid levels of cash flow to our general market and commodity cycles allows us to fund a substantial portion of expansion capital while continuing to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and consistently grow our dividend.
Let's turn now to the business segments that generate that strong cash flow. First, U.S. Transmission reported second quarter 2012 EBIT of $237 million compared with $243 million last year. Quarterly EBIT reflects increased earnings from expansion projects as expected. However, the benefit was more than offset by lower processing revenues and as expected, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's move to Distribution. Distribution reported second quarter EBIT of $75 million compared with $88 million in 2011. The decrease is mainly due to a $5 million charge resulting from a negative regulatory decision affecting 2010 and 2011 storage revenues and a weaker Canadian dollar.
Turning now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing. That business reported second quarter EBIT of $94 million compared with $113 million in 2011. Contributing to second quarter results, where additional earnings from the Horn River expansion projects and lower expenses due to the lack of any processing plants turnarounds this quarter. The second quarter of 2011 reflected cost associated with the McMahon plant turnaround. However, these gains were more than offset by losses at the Empress NGL plant, attributable mainly to lower NGL sales prices. For the second quarter, Empress realized an operating loss of $10 million and also recorded an $8 million noncash charge associated with a lower cost for market adjustment to its propane inventory. Until there is significant recovery in propane prices, we expect to see weak results from Empress.
Let's turn now to Field Services which reported second quarter EBIT of $66 million compared with $138 million in 2011. During the quarter, Field Services benefited from higher volumes as a result of its investment in key growth areas, such as the Permian basin and the Eagle Ford. Results also benefited from a reduction of depreciation expense, which recognizes an extension of the life of its gathering and processing assets attributable to the increase in recoverable reserves, thanks to enhance drilling techniques.
This accounting adjustment will benefit Spectra Energy on an ongoing basis by about $25 million per quarter. However, these positive effects were more than offset by lower commodity prices. During the second quarter of 2012, average NGL prices dropped by $0.47 from the prior year and NYMEX natural gas declined by $2.09. Crude oil prices saw a much lower decline, averaging about $10 per barrel or 10% lower than a year ago. The bottom line is that we're seeing a historically low and in our view unsustainable correlation of NGLs to crude oil. The correlation is currently running about 30% compared to the 50% to 60% level that we've seen over the last 10 years. 
Barring insignificant commodity price improvements, we expect to see average annual NGL prices in the $0.75 to $0.85 per gallon range, based on DCP's mix of NGL prizes, which is weighted about 50% Conway and 50% Mount Belvieu. We expect natural gas prices in the $2.50 to $3 range and crude at about $90 for the full year. Based on the sensitivities that we previously provided for our Field Services segment, you can estimate the effect that low commodity prices will have on Field Services earnings contribution to Spectra Energy's results this year.
Notwithstanding the weaker commodity price environment that we find ourselves in, we still receive $61 million of cash distributions from DCP Midstream during the quarter and $150 million year to date.
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily comprised of corporate costs, including employee and retiree benefits and captive insurance expense. Other reported net costs of $25 million compared with $29 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was $155 million compared to the $159 million last year. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $80 million compared to the $125 million last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% on a reported basis and 27% reflecting controlling interest and we think that 27% is about our run rate for the full year. And the slightly weaker Canadian dollar decreased second quarter net income by about $4 million compared to last year's quarter. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%. We continue to expect to fund our expansion CapEx program through a combination internally generated funds and debt, while maintaining our investment grade credit matrix. And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of about $2.9 billion with available liquidity of about $1.9 billion.
So it was a bit of a tough quarter because of commodity prices but our fundamentals remain strong. We feel good about where we are today and our future prospects. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate continued and attractive dividend growth. 
As we demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across all commodity and market cycles. You can expect us to fulfill that commitment based on these facts: First, we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. Second, we have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. And finally, we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employees. 
So with that, let me turn things back over to John, so we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

So you get that time period there where you see kind of decline Conway prices going from $1.30 to in December to $0.50 in July. That's the exposure you have and as such -- kind of our extraordinary but that's what we've seen."

As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy delivered second quarter ongoing results of $215 million or $0.33 per share.

As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy delivered second quarter ongoing results of $215 million or $0.33 per share. Like many in the sector, we felt the effects of weak commodity prices which were much lower than our original assumptions. Our Field Services segment experienced the most significant impact. However, lower propane prices also adversely affected our Empress plants in Western Canada. It was definitely a tough quarter for commodity prices. NGL prices dropped almost 40% from 2011. NYMEX natural gas average almost 50% lower and prices were weakened by a lower demand caused by petchem outages, slower economic conditions, record warm winter weather and exceptionally dry summer affecting crop drying expectations.
Recently, we have seen an uptick in commodity prices off the low point about 6 weeks ago. But I think it's fair to say that it would take an extraordinary increase in NGL prices for the rest of the 2012 to be at the average level we projected at the begin of the year.
Pat will provide more details around our commodity price expectations in just a few minutes but given the current and near-term commodity price environment, it's very unlikely we'll realize our $1.90 earnings per share target for 2012. 
Now that said, looking beyond the quarter to the longer-term, the NGL fundamentals remain very positive for our business. Crude oil remains expensive relative to NGLs, new demand sources on the petrochemical front are set to come into service mid-decade. The infrastructure bottlenecks that restrict our volumes and Conway pricing relative to Mont Belvieu should dissipate over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, propane should benefit from new export facilities starting late this year and early next. And we'll then have to assume that the abnormally warm winters and dry summers we've experienced are just that abnormal. All of these supports the long-term growth of the NGL business in North America and as a large producer of NGLs in the U.S., bodes very well for Spectra Energy's NGL business. Importantly, our fee-based businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations, and our expansion opportunities remains strong and growing.
And as we projected at the beginning of the year, we saw increased earnings from expansion projects at U.S. Transmission, Western Canada and Field Services during the second quarter. Our consistent fee-based earnings allowed us to deliver predictable steady dividend growth, regardless of the commodity cycles. And as we have indicated previously, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver at least an $0.08 increase in our annual dividend over the next several years. 
In support of our growing dividend, we've had a solid roster of expansion projects, those are now in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy-financed projects and more than $4 billion of DCP-financed expansion projects. We also have a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing shareholder value. All of these underlines our expectations of investing up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. 
In the near term, our 2012 to '14 expansion projects are in execution and on track. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. I'll highlight a few of these. In Western Canada, we're in the homestretch to complete about $1.5 billion Horn River Montney investment program, a series of strategic expansion projects. The first phase of the Dawson processing plant is now in service, and construction of Phase 2 is underway and expected to be completed by early 2013. The T-North pipeline expansion project provides additional takeaway capacity from the Horn River and Montney areas, and is supported by long-term firm contracts with shippers. This project went into service in the second quarter. And our final project in this investment program is the Fort Nelson North plant, which we expect to go online late this year. Also on track to go on to service in late 2012 is our $200 million TEAM 2012 project, designed to move Marcellus supplies from South Western Pennsylvania to markets in the Northeast. The project's fully subscribed by Range Resources and Chesapeake Utilities. And the next phase of our team project is the TEAM 2014 project. We've reached binding agreements with 2 anchor shippers, Chevron and EQT, for the project's full capacity. And we submitted our FERC prefiling in July. We expect to begin construction in early 2014 for the targeted in-service date of late 2014. 
Last month, we started construction on the New Jersey - New York expansion project, having received FERC approval in late June. And when this $1.2 billion project goes into service in the fourth quarter of 2013, it will provide much needed gas supply in economic benefits to the region. It will also create future opportunities for us in the area and annual EBITDA of about $110 million. A smaller project that you might not be aware of is the Thunder Bay project, which will serve on Ontario power plant being converted from coal to gas. This project is actually the first of an expected $300 million to $400 million slate of opportunities to capture continued power generation conversions in Ontario. And as we earlier -- as we said earlier, DCP Midstream is moving forward with more than $4 billion of projects in execution, producing fee-based earnings growth by quadrupling its NGL pipeline capacity. DCP is making excellent progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. The Sand Hills Pipeline is designed to provide NGL transportation from the Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale region to the Gulf Coast. They'll be phased into service, with the first phase about 65% complete already and scheduled to be in service from Eagle Ford to the Mont Belvieu area later this year. Right away, acquisition of material sourcing is substantially complete for the second phase from the Permian, which has a targeted in-service date of the second half of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the Midcontinent to Mont Belvieu has a targeted in-service date of mid-'13. 
Rehabilitation work on the existing pipeline, which we purchased from ConocoPhillips in the fourth quarter 2011 is nearing completion, and construction of more than 300 miles of new pipelines has been initiated. In addition to these NGL pipeline projects, DCP is also building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. It recently broke ground on 3 of these projects. The expansion of the National Helium Plant in the Midcon. The LaSalle Plant, which will provide service to producers in the DJ Basin. And the Rawhide processing plant that will serve producers focused on the Wolfberry production in the West Texas region of the Permian. As a reminder, DCP self-funds its own growth, which of course is advantageous to Spectra Energy and its investors. 
As mentioned earlier, with our expansion projects and our development plans on the horizon, we see more than $20 billion in expansion projects and opportunities through the end of the decade. In U.S. Transmission, we're pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities, many of them including NEXT, OPEN, AIM and Renaissance will connect from Marcellus and Utica suppliers to diverse North American markets, including the Midwest power market, premium Northeast and New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada, and gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. And we've got other opportunities across their system as well. 
In Western Canada, we see about $4 billion to $6 billion in expansion projects through the decade. We're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports and in fact, we're in advanced negotiations to provide pipeline infrastructure to support the development of British Colombia LNG export projects. And DCP Midstream has another $2 billion to $3 billion in the development opportunities, primarily in gathering and processing and NGL infrastructure. So as you can see, our business plan and strategy remains solidly on track. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and we're continuing to demonstrate our commitment and capacity in all fronts, through our various commodity and base business cycles. Rewarding investors with steady, reliable dividend growth. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will take you through our second quarter financial performance before we take your questions."

As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing second quarter earnings of $215 million or $0.33 per share, compared with $275 million or $0.42 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 mill",1017,"Well, thank you, Greg and good morning, all. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing second quarter earnings of $215 million or $0.33 per share, compared with $275 million or $0.42 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 million compared with $816 million last year. As we've noted before, our ability to generate solid levels of cash flow to our general market and commodity cycles allows us to fund a substantial portion of expansion capital while continuing to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and consistently grow our dividend.
Let's turn now to the business segments that generate that strong cash flow. First, U.S. Transmission reported second quarter 2012 EBIT of $237 million compared with $243 million last year. Quarterly EBIT reflects increased earnings from expansion projects, as expected. However, the benefit was more than offset by lower processing revenues and, as expected, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's move to Distribution. Distribution reported second quarter EBIT of $75 million compared with $88 million in 2011. The decrease is mainly due to a $5 million charge resulting from a negative regulatory decision affecting 2010 and 2011 storage revenues, and a weaker Canadian dollar.
Turning now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing. That business reported second quarter EBIT of $94 million compared with $113 million in 2011. Contributing to second quarter results were additional earnings from the Horn River expansion projects, and lower expenses due to the lack of any processing plant turnarounds this quarter. The second quarter of 2011 reflected cost associated with the McMahon Plant turnaround. However, these gains were more than offset by losses at the Empress NGL plant, attributable mainly to lower NGL sales prices. For the second quarter, Empress realized an operating loss of $10 million and also recorded an $8 million noncash charge associated with a lower cost for market adjustment to its propane inventory. Until there is significant recovery in propane prices, we expect to see weak results from Empress.
Let's turn now to Field Services, which reported second quarter EBIT of $66 million compared with $138 million in 2011. During the quarter, Field Services benefited from higher volumes as a result of its investment in key growth areas, such as the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford. Results also benefited from a reduction of depreciation expense, which recognizes an extension of the life of its gathering and processing assets attributable to the increase in recoverable reserves, thanks to enhanced drilling techniques.
This accounting adjustment will benefit Spectra Energy on an ongoing basis by about $25 million per quarter. However, these positive effects were more than offset by lower commodity prices. During the second quarter of 2012, average NGL prices dropped by $0.47 from the prior year, and NYMEX natural gas declined by $2.09. Crude oil prices saw a much lower decline, averaging about $10 per barrel or 10% lower than a year ago. The bottom line is that we're seeing a historically low, and in our view, unsustainable correlation of NGLs to crude oil. The correlation is currently running about 30% compared to the 50% to 60% level that we've seen over the last 10 years. 
Foreign significant commodity price improvements, we expect to see average annual NGL prices in the $0.75 to $0.85 per gallon range, based on DCP's mix of NGL prizes, which is weighted about 50% Conway and 50% Mount Belvieu. We expect natural gas prices in the $2.50 to $3 range, and crude at about $90 for the full year. Based on the sensitivities that we've previously provided for our Field Services segment, you can estimate the effect that low commodity prices will have on Field Services earnings contribution to Spectra Energy's results this year.
Notwithstanding the weaker commodity price environment that we find ourselves in, we still received $61 million of cash distributions from DCP Midstream during the quarter and $150 million year-to-date.
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily composed of corporate costs, including employee and retiree benefits and captive insurance expense. Other reported net costs of $25 million compared with $29 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was $155 million compared to the $159 million last year. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $80 million compared to the $125 million last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% on a reported basis and 27% reflecting controlling interest, and we think that 27% is about our run rate for the full year. And the slightly weaker Canadian dollar decreased second quarter net income by about $4 million compared to last year's quarter. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%. We continue to expect to fund our expansion CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while maintaining our investment grade credit metrics. And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of about $2.9 billion with available liquidity of about $1.9 billion.
So it was a bit of a tough quarter because of commodity prices but our fundamentals remain strong. We feel good about where we are today and our future prospects. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate continued and attractive dividend growth. 
As we demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across all commodity and market cycles. You can expect us to fulfill that commitment based on these facts: first, we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. Second, we have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. And finally, we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed. 
So with that, let me turn things back over to John, so that we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

So it's all over the map right now but I think you're right. Obviously with low propane prices, people aren't going to pay those type of extraction premiums.

But we think Prince Rupert is a great location, as well, so that might give you a little bit of ideas. I think as you look at some consolidation and folks buying assets in Canada on the upstream side, I think that's probably another indication of the kind of folks that are involved. You've seen CNOOC, Petronas, et cetera involved. Those are the types of players -- and I think you're going to see some aggregation. My view is, you probably don't see 4 or 5 built up there, you see somewhere between 1 and 3 builds. So -- and who knows, on a longer-term perspective, these are all massive pipeline projects for -- not just the LNG side.

As you've seen from our earnings release, Spectra Energy delivered second quarter ongoing results of $215 million or $0.33 per share. Like many in the sector, we felt the effects of weak commodity prices which were much lower than our original assumptions. Our Field Services segment experienced the most significant impact. However, lower propane prices also adversely affected our Empress plants in Western Canada. It was definitely a tough quarter for commodity prices. NGL prices dropped almost 40% from 2011. NYMEX natural gas average almost 50% lower and prices were weakened by a lower demand caused by petchem outages, slower economic conditions, record warm winter weather and exceptionally dry summer affecting crop drying expectations.
Recently, we have seen an uptick in commodity prices off the low point about 6 weeks ago. But I think it's fair to say that it would take an extraordinary increase in NGL prices for the rest of the 2012 to be at the average level we projected at the begin of the year.
Pat will provide more details around our commodity price expectations in just a few minutes but given the current and near-term commodity price environment, it's very unlikely we'll realize our $1.90 earnings per share target for 2012. 
Now that said, looking beyond the quarter to the longer-term, the NGL fundamentals remain very positive for our business. Crude oil remains expensive relative to NGLs, new demand sources on the petrochemical front are set to come into service mid-decade. The infrastructure bottlenecks that restrict our volumes and Conway pricing relative to Mont Belvieu should dissipate over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, propane should benefit from new export facilities starting late this year and early next. And we'll then have to assume that the abnormally warm winters and dry summers we've experienced are just that abnormal. All of these supports the long-term growth of the NGL business in North America and as a large producer of NGLs in the U.S., bodes very well for Spectra Energy's NGL business. Importantly, our fee-based businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations, and our expansion opportunities remains strong and growing.
And as we projected at the beginning of the year, we saw increased earnings from expansion projects at U.S. Transmission, Western Canada and Field Services during the second quarter. Our consistent fee-based earnings allowed us to deliver predictable steady dividend growth, regardless of the commodity cycles. And as we have indicated previously, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver at least an $0.08 increase in our annual dividend over the next several years. 
In support of our growing dividend, we've had a solid roster of expansion projects, those are now in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy-financed projects and more than $4 billion of DCP-financed expansion projects. We also have a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing shareholder value. All of these underlines our expectations of investing up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. 
In the near term, our 2012 to '14 expansion projects are in execution and on track. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. I'll highlight a few of these. In Western Canada, we're in the homestretch to complete about $1.5 billion Horn River Montney investment program, a series of strategic expansion projects. The first phase of the Dawson processing plant is now in service, and construction of Phase 2 is underway and expected to be completed by early 2013. The T-North pipeline expansion project provides additional takeaway capacity from the Horn River and Montney areas, and is supported by long-term firm contracts with shippers. This project went into service in the second quarter. And our final project in this investment program is the Fort Nelson North plant, which we expect to go online late this year. Also on track to go on to service in late 2012 is our $200 million TEAM 2012 project, designed to move Marcellus supplies from South Western Pennsylvania to markets in the Northeast. The project's fully subscribed by Range Resources and Chesapeake Utilities. And the next phase of our team project is the TEAM 2014 project. We've reached binding agreements with 2 anchor shippers, Chevron and EQT, for the project's full capacity. And we submitted our FERC prefiling in July. We expect to begin construction in early 2014 for the targeted in-service date of late 2014. 
Last month, we started construction on the New Jersey - New York expansion project, having received FERC approval in late June. And when this $1.2 billion project goes into service in the fourth quarter of 2013, it will provide much needed gas supply in economic benefits to the region. It will also create future opportunities for us in the area and annual EBITDA of about $110 million. A smaller project that you might not be aware of is the Thunder Bay project, which will serve an Ontario power plant being converted from coal to gas. This project is actually the first of an expected $300 million to $400 million slate of opportunities to capture continued power generation conversions in Ontario. And as we earlier -- as we said earlier, DCP Midstream is moving forward with more than $4 billion of projects in execution, producing fee-based earnings growth by quadrupling its NGL pipeline capacity. DCP is making excellent progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. The Sand Hills Pipeline is designed to provide NGL transportation from the Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale region to the Gulf Coast. They'll be phased into service, with the first phase about 65% complete already and scheduled to be in service from Eagle Ford to the Mont Belvieu area later this year. Right away, acquisition of material sourcing is substantially complete for the second phase from the Permian, which has a targeted in-service date of the second half of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the Midcontinent to Mont Belvieu has a targeted in-service date of mid-'13. 
Rehabilitation work on the existing pipeline, which we purchased from ConocoPhillips in the fourth quarter 2011 is nearing completion, and construction of more than 300 miles of new pipelines has been initiated. In addition to these NGL pipeline projects, DCP is also building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. It recently broke ground on 3 of these projects. The expansion of the National Helium Plant in the Midcon. The LaSalle Plant, which will provide service to producers in the DJ Basin. And the Rawhide processing plant that will serve producers focused on the Wolfberry production in the West Texas region of the Permian. As a reminder, DCP self-funds its own growth, which of course is advantageous to Spectra Energy and its investors. 
As mentioned earlier, with our expansion projects and our development plans on the horizon, we see more than $20 billion in expansion projects and opportunities through the end of the decade. In U.S. Transmission, we're pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities, many of them including NEXT, OPEN, AIM and Renaissance will connect from Marcellus and Utica suppliers to diverse North American markets, including the Midwest power market, premium Northeast and New England markets, LDCs and power generators in Eastern Canada, and gas and electric utilities in the Southeast U.S. And we've got other opportunities across their system as well. 
In Western Canada, we see about $4 billion to $6 billion in expansion projects through the decade. We're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports and in fact, we're in advanced negotiations to provide pipeline infrastructure to support the development of British Colombia LNG export projects. And DCP Midstream has another $2 billion to $3 billion in the development opportunities, primarily in gathering and processing in NGL infrastructure. So as you can see, our business plan and strategy remains solidly on track. We're expanding our impressive portfolio of assets and we're continuing to demonstrate our commitment and capacity in all fronts, through our various commodity and base business cycles. Rewarding investors with steady, reliable dividend growth. 
So with that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will take you through our second quarter financial performance before we take your questions."

Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 mill",1016,"Well, thank you, Greg and good morning, all. As Greg mentioned, Spectra Energy reported ongoing second quarter earnings of $215 million or $0.33 per share, compared with $275 million or $0.42 per share in 2011. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $674 million compared with $816 million last year. As we've noted before, our ability to generate solid levels of cash flow throughout general market and commodity cycles allows us to fund a substantial portion of expansion capital while continuing to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and consistently grow our dividend.
Let's turn now to the business segments that generate that strong cash flow. First, U.S. Transmission reported second quarter 2012 EBIT of $237 million compared with $243 million last year. Quarterly EBIT reflects increased earnings from expansion projects, as expected. However, the benefit was more than offset by lower processing revenues and, as expected, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's move to Distribution. Distribution reported second quarter EBIT of $75 million compared with $88 million in 2011. The decrease is mainly due to a $5 million charge resulting from a negative regulatory decision affecting 2010 and 2011 storage revenues, and a weaker Canadian dollar.
Turning now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing. That business reported second quarter EBIT of $94 million compared with $113 million in 2011. Contributing to second quarter results were additional earnings from the Horn River expansion projects, and lower expenses due to the lack of any processing plant turnarounds this quarter. The second quarter of 2011 reflected cost associated with the McMahon Plant turnaround. However, these gains were more than offset by losses at the Empress NGL plant, attributable mainly to lower NGL sales prices. For the second quarter, Empress realized an operating loss of $10 million and also recorded an $8 million noncash charge associated with a lower cost for market adjustment to its propane inventory. Until there is significant recovery in propane prices, we expect to see weak results from Empress.
Let's turn now to Field Services, which reported second quarter EBIT of $66 million compared with $138 million in 2011. During the quarter, Field Services benefited from higher volumes as a result of its investment in key growth areas, such as the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford. Results also benefited from a reduction of depreciation expense, which recognizes an extension of the life of its gathering and processing assets attributable to the increase in recoverable reserves, thanks to enhanced drilling techniques.
This accounting adjustment will benefit Spectra Energy on an ongoing basis by about $25 million per quarter. However, these positive effects were more than offset by lower commodity prices. During the second quarter of 2012, average NGL prices dropped by $0.47 from the prior year, and NYMEX natural gas declined by $2.09. Crude oil prices saw a much lower decline, averaging about $10 per barrel or 10% lower than a year ago. The bottom line is that we're seeing a historically low, and in our view, unsustainable correlation of NGLs to crude oil. The correlation is currently running about 30% compared to the 50% to 60% level that we've seen over the last 10 years. 
Barring significant commodity price improvements, we expect to see average annual NGL prices in the $0.75 to $0.85 per gallon range, based on DCP's mix of NGL prizes, which is weighted about 50% Conway and 50% Mount Belvieu. We expect natural gas prices in the $2.50 to $3 range, and crude at about $90 for the full year. Based on the sensitivities that we've previously provided for our Field Services segment, you can estimate the effect that low commodity prices will have on Field Services earnings contribution to Spectra Energy's results this year.
Notwithstanding the weaker commodity price environment that we find ourselves in, we still received $61 million of cash distributions from DCP Midstream during the quarter and $150 million year-to-date.
Now let me turn to Other, which is primarily composed of corporate costs, including employee and retiree benefits and captive insurance expense. Other reported net costs of $25 million compared with $29 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was $155 million compared to the $159 million last year. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $80 million compared to the $125 million last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% on a reported basis and 27% reflecting controlling interest, and we think that 27% is about our run rate for the full year. And the slightly weaker Canadian dollar decreased second quarter net income by about $4 million compared to last year's quarter. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%. We continue to expect to fund our expansion CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while maintaining our investment grade credit metrics. And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of about $2.9 billion with available liquidity of about $1.9 billion.
So it was a bit of a tough quarter because of commodity prices but our fundamentals remain strong. We feel good about where we are today and our future prospects. We're continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate continued and attractive dividend growth. 
As we demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across all commodity and market cycles. You can expect us to fulfill that commitment based on these facts: first, we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by multiple financing vehicles. Second, we have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. And finally, we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed. 
So with that, let me turn things back over to John, so that we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

So it's all over the map right now but I think you're right. Obviously with low propane prices, people aren't going to pay those type of extraction premiums. So we're not even out there in the day market buying that type of stuff unless we can sell it immediately at a profit -- that kind of thing. So these things do balance themselves out.

But we think Prince Rupert is a great location, as well, so that might give you a little bit of ideas. I think as you look at some consolidation and folks buying assets in Canada on the upstream side, I think that's probably another indication of the kind of folks that are involved. You've seen CNOOC, Petronas, et cetera involved. Those are the types of players -- and I think you're going to see some aggregation. My view is, you probably don't see 4 or 5 built up there, you see somewhere between 1 and 3 builds. So -- and who knows, on a longer-term perspective, these are all massive pipeline projects for -- not just the LNG side.

I want to echo John's comments and concern for those of you in the Northeast recovering from the great storm, particularly our customers and employees. As you've seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $179 million or $0.27 per share. Earnings for the quarter are down year-on-year basically because of weak commodity prices affecting earnings at both DCP Midstream and at Empress. However, our early business continued to perform well. In fact, on a Commodity neutral basis, our year-to-date earnings are very much in line with our expectations. Even with the current weakness in commodity prices, we remain optimistic about longer-term NGL fundamentals. For example, we expect to see growth in propane exports starting later this year and significantly increase ethane demand by the petrochemical sector over the next several years along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in North America. So our view tends to be strong fundamentals and expanding market opportunities longer term. In the near term, we expect some commodity choppiness. But that's nothing we haven't managed through in the past. And fortunately, thanks to the size and strength of the business, we're able to maintain our focus on the longer-term and take advantage of the significant growth opportunities before both Spectra Energy and our joint venture DCP. As we mentioned last quarter, with the commodity price out environment that exist today, it's not possible to meet our $1.90 earnings per share target for the year. And at this point, we anticipate the commodity prices will have a negative $0.50 to $0.55 impact on our 2012 earnings per share. Of course, there are number of other factors that affect our earnings either positively or negatively. 
Importantly, our fee-based businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations and our expansion opportunities remain strong and growing. Our fee-based businesses continue to generate strong earnings and cash flows, helping to offset the effects of lower commodity prices. And that's the beauty of Spectra Energy's business, predominantly stable, fee-based earnings that provides a great foundation from which to increase our dividend and to deliver commodity neutral earnings growth. As you will recall, we expect delivered dividend growth of at least $0.08 a year through 2014. Yesterday, we announced that our board has approved a 10-cent per share increase in our dividend bringing our total annualized dividend to $1.22 per share. This is consistent with our overall strategy to provide total shareholder returns through a combination of earnings and dividend growth, strategy that has allowed us to deliver total shareholder return of 60% since January 2010. We also have a solid roster of expansion projects in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy Partners finance projects and more than $4 billion of expansion projects at DCP Midstream. So $8 billion in 2012 to 2014 expansion projects are in execution. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. Highlights just a few of those for you. 
The Philadelphia Lateral, we're delivering incremental volumes; a firm natural gas supplier along our Texas Eastern system; our TEAM 2012 project is now in service, fully subscribed in generating revenues. The next phase of our ongoing team projects is TEAM 2014. That project is fully subscribed with a targeted in-service date of late 2014 and are making excellent progress on the construction of the New Jersey-New York expansion project and are on pace achieve our projected state of fourth quarter 2013. 
Hurricane Sandy has certainly caused us a few days of construction but nothing substantial for project of this size. In British Columbia, the T-North 2012 project is slated for a fourth quarter in service date. We're also complete construction of the Fort Nelson facility in the fourth quarter, followed by an in-service date early in the new year. And as many of you heard during the DCP Analyst Day in Denver a few weeks ago, DCP Midstream will place more than $3 billion of projects into service over the course of just the next 12 months. Given the magnitude of the opportunities ahead, DCP has raised its growth capital investment outlook to $5 billion to $7 billing between 2011 and 2015. 
DCP is building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. There are 4 plants under construction, all proceeding as planned and when you consider additional opportunities on the drawing board, that could make some 10 or more new plants built over the next few years. DCP is making good progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, sand Hills and Southern Hills. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire 1/3 in each of these, but I'll come back to that in a minute. With respect to the projects themselves, the Sand Hills Pipeline is being phased into service. Last week, DCP announced that the first phase of the project is now online and has begun providing in the Eagle Ford, with direct connection to Mont Belvieu by year end. The project's second phase, the Permian portion of the pipeline has advanced and is now due to in-service in the second quarter of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the midcontinent to Mont Belvieu has a targeted in-service date of mid-2013. We originally expected both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to be full within the first 3 years of operation. That is now accelerated and we expect volumes to come up quicker based on deals completed and pending. 
Beyond what's in execution, DCP Midstream has about $2 billion to $3 billion in additional development opportunities, primarily in Gathering & Processing and NGL infrastructure projects. Sand Hills and Southern Hills are outstanding projects. In yesterday's Spectra Energy and our joint venture Phillips 66 announced an agreement in which each company will acquire from DCP a 1/3 interest in both pipelines. The transaction is expected to close by the end of November at which time, the 3 companies will each own a 1/3 interest in Sand Hills and Southern Hills and equally fund the remaining capital expenditures. The total investment by Spectra Energy in the 2 pipelines is expected to be between $700 million and $800 million. This agreement is a win-win all the way around, the 2 systems are outstanding, NGL pipeline projects that will complement Spectra Energy's existing network of Natural Gas Pipelines. As is placed in the service, the pipeline's a lot attractive, stable earnings and cash flow to our results, and the agreement also signifies continued strong owner support for DCP, ensuring it can continue advancing its attractive growth plans and move quickly on the enormous slate of opportunities before them even when the commodity prices are choppy. You can expect DCP Midstream to retain its standing as the largest NGL producer in the U.S. and to enhance its Gathering & Processing position. You may have seen that Hart Energy recently announced that DCP maintained its ranking as the number 1 NGL producers in the country and rose to number 2 in natural gas processing. 
Of course the rest of Spectra Energy, we got a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing value. All of these underlines our expectation to invest up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. And we made some really good progress on many of these opportunities over the last few months, so I'll provide a couple updates. In the U.S. Transmission sector, we are pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities and are proceeding well at all. Since we spoke with you last quarter, we even bark on our Nexus Gas Transmission project with partners DT Energy and Enbridge. Nexus will move growing supplies of Utica and Marcellus gas to markets in the Midwest and on Ontario. Upon project completion, Spectra Energy will become a 20% owner in the vector pipeline, a joint venture between DT Energy and Enbridge. 
When the midst of an open season for the AIM project which expands the pipeline capacity of our existing Algonquin system. The open season which concludes tomorrow is yielding high levels of interest and positive momentum. We're also pursuing a number of projects that will serve the growing Florida market for natural gas fire power generation and projects like our Renaissance pipeline that can provide a conduit to other Southeastern markets. 
In Western Canada, we're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports, and in September, we announced plans to jointly develop with BG Group, a new natural gas pipeline from the northeast BC to serve BG's proposed LNG export facility in Prince Rupert. The new pipeline represents our next wave of investment opportunity in BC, and allows us to create value by leveraging surplus B.C. natural gas supplies and facilitating its exports to high demand international markets. We expect to make a final investment decision alongside BG by 2015. 
Underscoring our commitment and focus on LNG infrastructure, we announced that Doug Bloom, who many of you is President of our Western Canadian business, will now become President of a new Spectra Energy business, Canadian LNG, and lead our efforts in securing LNG opportunities in Western Canada. 
So Spectra is really focused on the long-term. We have what it takes to deliver attractive growing shareholder return. We have a stable and high-performing businesses and a balanced business model focused on long-term sustainable value creation. In fact, worn out by our commitment to dividend and earnings growth, our asset footprint has unrivaled in our sector. We enjoy that first mile access to North America's premium and supplier regions and last mile access to expanding natural gas markets. We operate in an industry with strong fundamentals that supports the need for infrastructure. And our financial strength, flexibility, multiple financing vehicles also supports earnings and dividend growth. With that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will walk you through our third quarter financial performance."
610501,222766261,375023,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share, compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 mo",1128,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share, compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 months of this year, we've delivered almost 3 quarters of $1 billion in net income. And year to date our EBIT totaled about $1.5 billion. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA, which reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our businesses. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $655 million and year to date it totaled more than $2.2 billion. Our current level of cash generation allows us to fund our CapEx program without issuing equity, maintained a solid balance sheet and as we demonstrated yesterday, continue to grow our dividend. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $238 million, compared with $235 million in the third quarter of 2011. Quarterly EBIT results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects in line with our expectations and lower operating costs. These benefits were partially offset by lower processing revenues and as anticipated, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's turn to our Distribution operations. Distribution reported third quarter EBIT of $55 million, compared with $50 million last year, mainly due to higher short-term transportation revenues. And as we've mentioned before, 2012 is the last year of our five-year incentive regulation framework in Ontario, a rate making approach that has been good for Union Gas and is equally important for our customers. As we near the end of that framework, we were required by our regulator, the Ontario Energy Board, to file for new cost of service rates, to be effective in 2013. Just last week, we received the OEB's decision. While the OEB did approve a small rate increase, it wasn't what we have been expecting. The OEB denied our request to increase equity fitness in our capital structure from the current 36% to our requested 40% and more importantly, they removed virtually all of the previous incentives that provided upside opportunities for both the company and our customers. We are disappointed in the OEB's ruling and we'll evaluate if and when it make sense for us to pursue another incentive rate framework going forward. We will continue to assess the effects of the decision and share more details with you in January. 
Let's turn now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing, which reported third quarter EBIT of $83 million compared to $119 million last year. The segment experienced lower earnings at Empress Natural Gas Liquids business and as anticipated, lower contracting volumes from the conventional production areas such as the Grizzly Valley in British Columbia. These reductions were partially offset by improved results in the Gathering & Processing business driven by higher contracted volumes from expansions in the Horn River and Montney areas of British Columbia. The majority of the $21 million loss at Empress this quarter is due to lower NGL sales prices, predominately for propane and higher input cost. Unless we see a dramatic upturn in propane prices, Empress earnings will remain challenged in the fourth quarter and we can see losses in the $10 million to $15 million range. 
I'll now turn to our Field Services segment which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $62 million, compared with $134 million in 2011. This $72 million decrease in EBIT was driven by an approximately $90 million reduction due to lower commodity prices. Year to date, the reduction attributable to lower commodity prices was approximately $200 million. Higher plant repairs and maintenance costs related to asset growth also reduced EBIT. We have some partial offset to these reductions including a gain associated with the issuances by DCP Midstream's NLP DPM and a reduction and depreciation expense as previously reported. In third quarter 2012, NGL prices for DCP's composite barrel averaged $0.72, more than 40% lower than in the 2011 quarter. NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.81, more than 30% lower than last year and crude oil averaged $92, about the same as in 2011 but the relationship between NGLs and crude decreased from 58% last year to 33% this year. DCP Midstream paid Distribution to $25 million to Spectra Energy in the third quarter and $175 million year to date. 
Now let me turn to our additional items for the quarter. Our other segment reported ongoing net cost of $29 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $23 million last year. Other is comprised primarily of corporate costs, including benefits and captive insurance cost. Interest expense during the quarter was $159 million, compared with $157 million in last year's third quarter. Third quarter income tax expense from continuing operations was $72 million, compared with $108 million last year. The lower tax expense was driven by lower earnings and the lower Canadian effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was reflected controlling interest was 29% in the third quarter compared with 30% in 2011. At the end of the quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%, unchanged from last quarter. And last month you may have seen that we issued $500 million in Texas Eastern tenure debt at a rate of 2.8%, the lowest coupon in our debt portfolio. As the quarters closed, we have total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion, and available liquidity of about $1.7 billion. 
As you've read this morning, we are continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion to the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant long-term incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate ongoing and attractive dividend growth. At the same time, due to our financials strength, and that of our partner, Phillips 66, we are able to help DCP capture attractive growth opportunities in advance of further recovery in NGL prices. 
As we've demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across commodity and market cycles. That commitment is grounded in confidence that we have considerable financial strengths and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by our ability to raise capital at the current level and our subsidiaries and our through our NLP. We have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first and last mile competitive advantage. And we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed that are well above our cost of capital. So with that, let me turn things back to John so we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

So we saw an opportunity were can be a little bit more this are trying to balance investors to get total shareholder return and makeup of the dividends and earnings. But I wouldn't suggest that changes the policy on that or that commitment to at least $0.08 a year. The payout ratio look, that's going to move up and down as you know, Ted, in the last several year where we've been targeting 65%. We never hit 60% given the strong earnings growth. So I think it's a more longer-term goal to be in that 65% range and some years, we're going to be above that and some years we're going to be lower than that. With respect to tax policy, yes, we'll have to see how that shapes out. I think is going to be pretty hectic and chaotic from a tax policy perspective. They do something on the dividend side, increase the taxes, I guess from a relative perspective, we'll be treated the same as others. If they look at overall tax perform, which is something that's talked about in the next Congress as well. There's a lot of talk about lowering corporate tax rates overall and closing a lot of other loopholes, so that's going to take into some duration for us. So we'll be watching that closely if it dramatically changes, then obviously, you look at everything and say what's the best everything from structure to results going forward based on a current tax policy."

It's just -- as you know, many of those pipes or many of those plants are on call it, 80%, 90% by 1 player and 10% by another?

It's just that we felt that the opportunity is so big, as you know the pipeline picked a number is somewhere between $4 billion and $8 billion. So that's obviously a massive opportunity. And there's more than 1 pipeline opportunity potentially up there. So we felt it was important to point a key executive in charge of that. Now Doug will have a small team. But there's also the requirement under our agreement with BJ that would put some dedicated individuals there and real focus over the next 2 or 3 years is around getting regulatory approvals, making sure that commercial aspects are in place. And of course, working with various stakeholders there and one of the big groups there would obviously be first nations -- abhoriginal folks of which we've had a good experience of dealing with them for more than 55 years in the redion, so that's really the focus. With respect to whether we'd invest in the LNG terminal, that has not been our choice today. I guess, I would never say never. But it would have to be a fee-based that structure as you see what pipelines for us to get into that. And typically, in our discussions with the various players there, they like pretty well control all that themselves. And they're also on the sales side up the product being produced. And we would not be on that side. So it's probably a better fit with what you've seen with the BGs and the super majors and the like. Actually owning those as opposed us. I would say never but it would have to be fee-based."

I want to echo John's comments and concern for those of you in the Northeast recovering from the great storm, particularly our customers and employees. As you've seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $179 million or $0.27 per share. Earnings for the quarter are down year-on-year basically because of weak commodity prices affecting earnings at both DCP Midstream and at Empress. However, our other businesses continued to perform well. In fact, on a commodity neutral basis, our year-to-date earnings are very much in line with our expectations. Even with the current weakness in commodity prices, we remain optimistic about longer-term NGL fundamentals. For example, we expect to see growth in propane exports starting later this year and significantly increase ethane demand by the petrochemical sector over the next several years along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in North America. So our view tends to be strong fundamentals and expanding market opportunities longer term. In the near term, we expect some commodity choppiness. But that's nothing we haven't managed through in the past. And fortunately, thanks to the size and strength of the business, we're able to maintain our focus on the longer term and take advantage of the significant growth opportunities before both Spectra Energy and our joint venture DCP. 
As we mentioned last quarter, with the commodity price out environment that exist today, it's not possible to meet our $1.90 earnings per share target for the year. And at this point, we anticipate that commodity prices will have a negative $0.50 to $0.55 impact on our 2012 earnings per share. Of course, there are number of other factors that can affect our earnings either positively or negatively. 
Importantly, our fee-based businesses continued to perform in line with our expectations and our expansion opportunities remained strong and growing. Our fee-based businesses continued to generate strong earnings and cash flows, helping to offset the effects of lower commodity prices. And that's the beauty of Spectra Energy's business, predominantly stable, fee-based earnings that provide a great foundation from which to increase our dividend and deliver commodity neutral earnings growth. As you will recall, we expect to deliver dividend growth of at least $0.08 a year through 2014. Yesterday, we announced that our board has approved a $0.10 per share increase in our dividend, bringing our total annualized dividend to $1.22 per share. This is consistent with our overall strategy to provide total shareholder returns through a combination of earnings and dividend growth, a strategy that has allowed us to deliver total shareholder return of 60% since January 2010. 
We also have a solid roster of expansion projects in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy finance projects and more than $4 billion of expansion projects at DCP Midstream. So $8 billion in 2012 to 2014 expansion projects are in execution. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. 
Highlight just a few of those for you: the Philadelphia Lateral, we're delivering incremental volumes; a firm natural gas supplier along our Texas Eastern system; our TEAM 2012 project is now in service, fully subscribed and generating revenues. The next phase of our ongoing team projects is TEAM 2014. That project is fully subscribed with a targeted in-service date of late 2014. And we're making excellent progress on the construction of the New Jersey-New York expansion project and we're on pace to achieve our projected in-service date of fourth quarter 2013. 
Hurricane Sandy has certainly caused us a few days of construction but nothing substantial for a project of this size. In British Columbia, the T-North 2012 project is slated for a fourth quarter in-service date. We'll also complete construction of the Fort Nelson North facility in the fourth quarter, followed by an in-service date early in the new year. And as many of you heard during the DCP Analyst Day in Denver a few weeks ago, DCP Midstream will place more than $3 billion of projects into service over the course of just the next 12 months. Given the magnitude of the opportunities ahead, DCP has raised its growth capital investment outlook to $5 billion to $7 billion between 2011 and 2015. 
DCP is building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. They have 4 plants under construction, all proceeding as planned. And when you consider additional opportunities on the drawing board, that could make some 10 or more new plants built over the next few years. DCP is making great progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire 1/3 in each of these, but I'll come back to that in a minute. With respect to the projects themselves, the Sand Hills Pipeline is being phased into service. Last week, DCP announced that the first phase of the project is now online and has begun providing service in the Eagle Ford with direct connection to Mont Belvieu by year end. The project's second phase, the Permian portion of the pipeline has advanced and is now due to be in-service in the second quarter of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu, has a targeted in-service date of mid-2013. We originally expected both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to be full within the first 3 years of operation. That is now accelerated and we expect volumes to come up quicker based on deals completed and pending. Beyond what's in execution, DCP Midstream has about $2 billion to $3 billion in additional development opportunities, primarily in gathering  and processing and NGL infrastructure projects. 
Sand Hills and Southern Hills are outstanding projects. And yesterday, Spectra Energy and our joint venture partner Phillips 66 announced an agreement in which each company will acquire from DCP a 1/3 interest in both pipelines. The transaction is expected to close by the end of November at which time, the 3 companies will each own a 1/3 interest in Sand Hills and Southern Hills and equally fund the remaining capital expenditures. The total investment by Spectra Energy in the 2 pipelines is expected to be between $700 million and $800 million. This agreement is a win-win all the way around, the 2 systems are outstanding NGL pipeline projects that will complement Spectra Energy's existing network of natural gas pipelines. 
As they're placed into service, the pipeline's a lot attractive, stable earnings and cash flow to our results, and the agreement also signifies continued strong owner support for DCP, ensuring it can continue advancing its attractive growth plans and move quickly on the enormous slate of opportunities before them even when commodity prices are choppy. You can expect DCP Midstream to retain its standing as the largest NGL producer in the U.S. and to enhance its gathering and processing position. You may have seen that Hart Energy recently announced that DCP maintained its ranking as the #1 NGL producer in the country and rose to #2 in natural gas processing. 
Across the rest of Spectra Energy, we got a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing value. All of these underlines our expectation to invest up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. And we've made some really good progress on many of these opportunities over the last few months, so I'll provide a couple updates. In the U.S. Transmission sector, we are pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities and are proceeding well with all. Since we spoke with you last quarter, we've embarked on our NEXUS Gas Transmission project with partners DTE Energy and Enbridge. NEXUS will move growing supplies of Utica and Marcellus gas to markets in the Midwest and on Ontario. Upon project completion, Spectra Energy will become a 20% owner in the vector pipeline, a joint venture between DTE Energy and Enbridge. 
We're in the midst of an open season for the AIM Project which expands the pipeline capacity of our existing Algonquin system. The open season, which concludes tomorrow, is yielding high levels of interest and positive momentum. We're also pursuing a number of projects that will serve the growing Florida market for natural gas fire power generation and projects like our Renaissance pipeline that can provide a conduit to other Southeastern markets. 
In Western Canada, we're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports. And in September, we announced plans to jointly develop with BG Group, a new natural gas pipeline from the northeast B.C. to serve BG's proposed LNG export facility in Prince Rupert. The new pipeline represents our next wave of investment opportunity in B.C., and allows us to create value by leveraging surplus B.C. natural gas supplies and facilitating its exports to high demand international markets. We expect to make a final investment decision alongside BG by 2015. 
Underscoring our commitment and focus on LNG infrastructure, we announced that Doug Bloom, who many of you know is President of our Western Canadian business, will now become President of a new Spectra Energy business, Canadian LNG, and lead our efforts in securing LNG opportunities in Western Canada. 
So Spectra is clearly focused on the long term. We have what it takes to deliver attractive growing shareholder return. We have stable and high-performing businesses and a balanced business model focused on long-term sustainable value creation. In fact, worn out by our commitment to dividend and earnings growth. Our asset footprint is unrivaled in our sector. We enjoy that first-mile access to North America's premium and supplier regions, and last-mile access to expanding natural gas markets. We operate in an industry with strong fundamentals that supports the need for infrastructure. And our financial strength, flexibility, multiple financing vehicles also support earnings and dividend growth. 
With that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will walk you through our third quarter financial performance."
610501,222766261,375289,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 mon",1119,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 months of this year, we've delivered almost 3 quarters of $1 billion in net income. And year-to-date, our EBIT totaled about $1.5 billion. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA, which reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our businesses. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $655 million and year-to-date, it totaled more than $2.2 billion. Our current level of cash generation allows us to fund our CapEx program without issuing equity, maintain a solid balance sheet and as we demonstrated yesterday, continue to grow our dividend. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $238 million, compared with $235 million in the third quarter of 2011. Quarterly EBIT results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects in line with our expectations and lower operating costs. These benefits were partially offset by lower processing revenues and as anticipated, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's turn to our Distribution operations. Distribution reported third quarter EBIT of $55 million, compared with $50 million last year, mainly due to higher short-term transportation revenues. And as we've mentioned before, 2012 is the last year of our 5-year incentive regulation framework in Ontario, a rate-making approach that has been good for Union Gas and equally important, for our customers. As we near the end of that framework, we were required by our regulator, the Ontario Energy Board, to file for new cost of service rates, to be effective in 2013. Just last week, we received the OEB's decision. While the OEB did approve a small rate increase, it wasn't what we had been expecting. The OEB denied our request to increase equity thickness in our capital structure from the current 36% to our requested 40% and more importantly, they removed virtually all of the previous incentives that provided upside opportunities for both the company and our customers. We are disappointed in the OEB's ruling and we'll evaluate if and when it makes sense for us to pursue another incentive rate framework going forward. We will continue to assess the effects of the decision and share more details with you in January. 
Let's turn now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing, which reported third quarter EBIT of $83 million compared to $119 million last year. The segment experienced lower earnings at the Empress Natural Gas Liquids business and as anticipated, lower contracted volumes from the conventional production areas such as the Grizzly Valley in British Columbia. These reductions were partially offset by improved results in the Gathering & Processing business driven by higher contracted volumes from expansions in the Horn River and Montney areas of British Columbia. The majority of the $21 million loss at Empress this quarter is due to lower NGL sales prices, predominately for propane and higher input cost. Unless we see a dramatic upturn in propane prices, Empress' earnings will remain challenged in the fourth quarter and we can see losses in the $10 million to $15 million range. 
I'll now turn to our Field Services segment which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $62 million, compared with $134 million in 2011. This $72 million decrease in EBIT was driven by an approximately $90 million reduction due to lower commodity prices. Year to date, the reduction attributable to lower commodity prices was approximately $200 million. Higher plant repairs and maintenance costs related to asset growth also reduced the EBIT. We had some partial offsets to these reductions including a gain associated with the issuances by DCP Midstream's MLP DPM and a reduction in depreciation expense as previously reported. In third quarter 2012, NGL prices for DCP's composite barrel averaged $0.72, more than 40% lower than in the 2011 quarter. NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.81, more than 30% lower than last year and crude oil averaged $92, about the same as in 2011 but the relationship between NGLs and crude decreased from 58% last year to 33% this year. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $25 million to Spectra Energy in the third quarter and $175 million year-to-date. 
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our Other segment reported ongoing net cost of $29 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $23 million last year. Other is comprised primarily of corporate costs, including benefits and captive insurance cost. Interest expense during the quarter was $159 million, compared with $157 million in last year's third quarter. Third quarter income tax expense from continuing operations was $72 million, compared with $108 million last year. The lower tax expense was driven by lower earnings and a lower Canadian effective tax rate. The effective tax rate reflected controlling interest was 29% in the third quarter compared with 30% in 2011. At the end of the quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%, unchanged from last quarter. And last month, you may have seen that we issued $500 million in Texas Eastern tenure debt at a rate of 2.8%, the lowest coupon in our debt portfolio. At the quarter's close, we have total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.7 billion. 
As you've heard this morning, we are continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant long-term incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate ongoing and attractive dividend growth. At the same time, due to our financial strength and that of our partner, Phillips 66, we are able to help DCP capture attractive growth opportunities in advance of further recovery in NGL prices. 
As we've demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across commodity and market cycles. That commitment is grounded in confidence that we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by our ability to raise capital at the parent level, at our subsidiaries or through our MLP. We have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first- and last-mile competitive advantage and we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed that are well above our cost of capital. So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

Well look, we have indicated that we will be able to pay at least $0.08 a year through 2014. We've looked at this each year, we saw several key projects coming on late next year, in New Jersey, New York and obviously, with Southern Hills and Sand Hills, so we saw an opportunity. We can do a little bit more this year, trying to balance out the needs of investors to get total shareholder return and makeup of dividends and earnings. But I wouldn't suggest that changes the policy on that or that commitment to at least $0.08 a year. The payout ratio, look, that's going to move up and down. As you know, Ted, in the last several years, well, we've been targeting 65%. We never hit 60% given the strong earnings growth. So I think it's a more longer-term goal to be in that 65% range. In some years, you're going to be above that, some years you're going to be lower than that. With respect to tax policy, yes, we'll have to see how that shapes out. I think it's going to be pretty hectic and chaotic from a tax policy perspective. If they do something on the dividend side and increase the taxes, I guess from a relative perspective, we'll be treated the same as others. If they look at overall tax reform, which is something that's talked about in the next Congress as well. There's a lot of talk about lowering corporate tax rates overall and closing a lot of other loopholes, so that's going to take into some consideration for us. So we'll be watching that closely. If it dramatically changes, then obviously, you look at everything and say, ""What's the best -- A, everything from structure to results going forward based on the current tax policy?"""

And there's more than one pipeline opportunity potentially up there. So we felt it was important to put a key executive in charge of that. Now Doug will have a small team. But there's also a requirement under our agreement with BG that we put some dedicated individuals there. And the real focus over the next 2 or 3 years is around getting regulatory approvals, making sure all the commercial aspects are in place. And of course, working with various stakeholders there and one of the big groups there would obviously be first nations -- aboriginal folks of which we've had a good experience of dealing with them for more than 55 years in the region, so that's really the focus. With respect to whether we'd invest in the LNG terminal, that has not been our choice today. I guess, I would never say never. But it would have to be a fee-based type structure as you see with pipelines for us to get into that. And typically, in our discussions with the various players there, they like to pretty well control all that themselves. And they're also on the sales side of the product being produced and we would not be on that side. So it's probably a better fit with what you've seen with the BGs and the super majors and the like, actually owning those facilities as opposed us.

I want to echo John's comments and concern for those of you in the Northeast recovering from the great storm, particularly our customers and employees. As you've seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $179 million or $0.27 per share. Earnings for the quarter are down year-on-year basically because of weak commodity prices affecting earnings at both DCP Midstream and at Empress. However, our other businesses continued to perform well. In fact, on a commodity neutral basis, our year-to-date earnings are very much in line with our expectations. Even with the current weakness in commodity prices, we remain optimistic about longer-term NGL fundamentals. For example, we expect to see growth in propane exports starting later this year and significantly increase ethane demand by the petrochemical sector over the next several years along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in North America. So our view tends to be strong fundamentals and expanding market opportunities longer term. In the near term, we expect some commodity choppiness. But that's nothing we haven't managed through in the past. And fortunately, thanks to the size and strength of the business, we're able to maintain our focus on the longer term and take advantage of the significant growth opportunities before both Spectra Energy and our joint venture DCP. 
As we mentioned last quarter, with the commodity price out environment that exists today, it's not possible to meet our $1.90 earnings per share target for the year. And at this point, we anticipate that commodity prices will have a negative $0.50 to $0.55 impact on our 2012 earnings per share. Of course, there are number of other factors that can affect our earnings either positively or negatively. 
Importantly, our fee-based businesses continued to perform in line with our expectations and our expansion opportunities remained strong and growing. Our fee-based businesses continue to generate strong earnings and cash flows, helping to offset the effects of lower commodity prices. And that's the beauty of Spectra Energy's business, predominantly stable, fee-based earnings that provide a great foundation from which to increase our dividend and deliver commodity neutral earnings growth. As you will recall, we expect to deliver dividend growth of at least $0.08 a year through 2014. Yesterday, we announced that our board has approved a $0.10 per share increase in our dividend, bringing our total annualized dividend to $1.22 per share. This is consistent with our overall strategy to provide total shareholder returns through a combination of earnings and dividend growth, a strategy that has allowed us to deliver total shareholder return of 60% since January 2010. 
We also have a solid roster of expansion projects in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy finance projects and more than $4 billion of expansion projects at DCP Midstream. So $8 billion in 2012 to 2014 expansion projects are in execution. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. 
Highlight just a few of those for you: the Philadelphia Lateral will deliver incremental volumes; a firm natural gas supplier along our Texas Eastern system; our TEAM 2012 project is now in service, fully subscribed and generating revenues. The next phase of our ongoing team projects is TEAM 2014. That project is fully subscribed with a targeted in-service date of late 2014. And we're making excellent progress on the construction of the New Jersey-New York expansion project and we're on pace to achieve our projected in-service date of fourth quarter 2013. 
Hurricane Sandy has certainly cost us a few days of construction but nothing substantial for a project of this size. In British Columbia, the T-North 2012 project is slated for a fourth quarter in-service date. We'll also complete construction of the Fort Nelson North facility in the fourth quarter, followed by an in-service date early in the new year. And as many of you heard during the DCP Analyst Day in Denver a few weeks ago, DCP Midstream will place more than $3 billion of projects into service over the course of just the next 12 months. Given the magnitude of the opportunities ahead, DCP has raised its growth capital investment outlook to $5 billion to $7 billion between 2011 and 2015. 
DCP is building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. They have 4 plants under construction, all proceeding as planned. And when you consider additional opportunities on the drawing board, that could mean some 10 or more new plants built over the next few years. DCP is making great progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire 1/3 in each of these, but I'll come back to that in a minute. With respect to the projects themselves, the Sand Hills Pipeline is being phased into service. Last week, DCP announced that the first phase of the project is now online and has begun providing service in the Eagle Ford with direct connection to Mont Belvieu by year end. The project's second phase, the Permian portion of the pipeline, has advanced and is now due to be in-service in the second quarter of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu, has a targeted in-service date of mid-2013. We originally expected both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to be full within the first 3 years of operation. That is now accelerated and we expect volumes to come up quicker based on deals completed and pending. Beyond what's in execution, DCP Midstream has about $2 billion to $3 billion in additional development opportunities, primarily in gathering and processing and NGL infrastructure projects. 
Sand Hills and Southern Hills are outstanding projects. And yesterday, Spectra Energy and our joint venture partner Phillips 66 announced an agreement in which each company will acquire from DCP a 1/3 interest in both pipelines. The transaction is expected to close by the end of November, at which time the 3 companies will each own a 1/3 interest in Sand Hills and Southern Hills and equally fund the remaining capital expenditures. The total investment by Spectra Energy in the 2 pipelines is expected to be between $700 million and $800 million. This agreement is a win-win all the way around; the 2 systems are outstanding NGL pipeline projects that will complement Spectra Energy's existing network of natural gas pipelines. 
As they're placed into service, the pipelines will add attractive, stable earnings and cash flow to our results, and the agreement also signifies continued strong owner support for DCP, ensuring it can continue advancing its attractive growth plans and move quickly on the enormous slate of opportunities before them even when commodity prices are choppy. You can expect DCP Midstream to retain its standing as the largest NGL producer in the U.S. and to enhance its gathering and processing position. You may have seen that Hart Energy recently announced that DCP maintained its ranking as the #1 NGL producer in the country and rose to #2 in natural gas processing. 
Across the rest of Spectra Energy, we've got a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing value. All of these underlines our expectation to invest up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. And we've made some really good progress on many of these opportunities over the last few months, so I'll provide a couple updates. In the U.S. Transmission sector, we are pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities and are proceeding well with all. Since we spoke with you last quarter, we've embarked on our NEXUS Gas Transmission project with partners DTE Energy and Enbridge. NEXUS will move growing supplies of Utica and Marcellus gas to markets in the Midwest and in Ontario. Upon project completion, Spectra Energy will become a 20% owner in the vector pipeline, a joint venture between DTE Energy and Enbridge. 
We're in the midst of an open season for the AIM Project which expands the pipeline capacity of our existing Algonquin system. The open season, which concludes tomorrow, is yielding high levels of interest and positive momentum. We're also pursuing a number of projects that will serve the growing Florida market for natural gas fire power generation and projects like our Renaissance pipeline that can provide a conduit to other Southeastern markets. 
In Western Canada, we're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports. And in September, we announced plans to jointly develop with BG Group, a new natural gas pipeline from the northeast B.C. to serve BG's proposed LNG export facility in Prince Rupert. The new pipeline represents our next wave of investment opportunity in B.C., and allows us to create value by leveraging surplus B.C. natural gas supplies and facilitating its exports to high demand international markets. We expect to make a final investment decision alongside BG by 2015. 
Underscoring our commitment and focus on LNG infrastructure, we announced that Doug Bloom, who many of you know is President of our Western Canadian business, will now become President of a new Spectra Energy business, Canadian LNG, and lead our efforts in securing LNG opportunities in Western Canada. 
So Spectra is clearly focused on the long term. We have what it takes to deliver attractive growing shareholder return. We have the stable and high-performing businesses and a balanced business model focused on long-term sustainable value creation, a fact borne out by our commitment to dividend and earnings growth. Our asset footprint is unrivaled in our sector. We enjoy that first-mile access to North America's prem and supply regions, and last-mile access to expanding natural gas markets. We operate an industry with strong fundamentals that supports the need for infrastructure. And our financial strength, flexibility, multiple financing vehicles also support earnings and dividend growth. 
With that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will walk you through our third quarter financial performance."

As you can see, in the first 9 months of this year, we've delivered almost 3 quarters of $1 billion in net income. And year-to-date, our EBIT totaled about $1.5 billion. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA, which reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our businesses. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $655 million and year-to-date, it totaled more than $2.2 billion. Our current level of cash generation allows us to fund our CapEx program without issuing equity, maintain a solid balance sheet and as we demonstrated yesterday, continue to grow our dividend. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $238 million, compared with $235 million in the third quarter of 2011. Quarterly EBIT results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects in line with our expectations and lower operating costs. These benefits were partially offset by lower processing revenues and as anticipated, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's turn to our Distribution operations. Distribution reported third quarter EBIT of $55 million, compared with $50 million last year, mainly due to higher short-term transportation revenues. And as we've mentioned before, 2012 is the last year of our 5-year incentive regulation framework in Ontario, a rate-making approach that has been good for Union Gas and equally important, for our customers. As we near the end of that framework, we were required by our regulator, the Ontario Energy Board, to file for new cost of service rates, to be effective in 2013. Just last week, we received the OEB's decision. While the OEB did approve a small rate increase, it wasn't what we had been expecting. The OEB denied our request to increase equity thickness in our capital structure from the current 36% to our requested 40% and more importantly, they removed virtually all of the previous incentives that provided upside opportunities for both the company and our customers. We are disappointed in the OEB's ruling and will evaluate if and when it makes sense for us to pursue another incentive rate framework going forward. We will continue to assess the effects of the decision and share more details with you in January. 
Let's turn now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing, which reported third quarter EBIT of $83 million compared with $119 million last year. The segment experienced lower earnings at the Empress Natural Gas Liquids business and as anticipated, lower contracted volumes from the conventional production areas such as the Grizzly Valley in British Columbia. These reductions were partially offset by improved results in the Gathering & Processing business driven by higher contracted volumes from expansions in the Horn River and Montney areas of British Columbia. The majority of the $21 million loss at Empress this quarter is due to lower NGL sales prices, predominately for propane and higher input cost. Unless we see a dramatic upturn in propane prices, Empress earnings will remain challenged in the fourth quarter and we could see losses in the $10 million to $15 million range. 
I'll now turn to our Field Services segment which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $62 million, compared with $134 million in 2011. This $72 million decrease in EBIT was driven by an approximately $90 million reduction due to lower commodity prices. Year to date, the reduction attributable to lower commodity prices was approximately $200 million. Higher plant repairs and maintenance costs related to asset growth also reduced EBIT. We had some partial offsets to these reductions including a gain associated with unit issuances by DCP Midstream's MLP DPM and a reduction in depreciation expense as previously reported. In third quarter 2012, NGL prices for DCP's composite barrel averaged $0.72, more than 40% lower than in the 2011 quarter. NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.81, more than 30% lower than last year and crude oil averaged $92, about the same as in 2011 but the relationship between NGLs and crude decreased from 58% last year to 33% this year. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $25 million to Spectra Energy in the third quarter and $175 million year-to-date. 
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our Other segment reported ongoing net cost of $29 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $23 million last year. Other is comprised primarily of corporate costs, including benefits and captive insurance cost. Interest expense during the quarter was $159 million, compared with $157 million in last year's third quarter. Third quarter income tax expense from continuing operations was $72 million, compared with $108 million last year. The lower tax expense was driven by lower earnings and a lower Canadian effective tax rate. The effective tax rate reflected controlling interest was 29% in the third quarter compared with 30% in 2011. At the end of the quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%, unchanged from last quarter. And last month, you may have seen that we issued $500 million in Texas Eastern tenure debt at a rate of 2.8%, the lowest coupon in our debt portfolio. At the quarter's close, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.7 billion. 
As you've heard this morning, we are continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant long-term incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate ongoing and attractive dividend growth. At the same time, due to our financial strength and that of our partner, Phillips 66, we are able to help DCP capture attractive growth opportunities in advance of further recovery in NGL prices. 
As we've demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across commodity and market cycles. That commitment is grounded in confidence that we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by our ability to raise capital at the parent level, at our subsidiaries or through our MLP. We have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first- and last-mile competitive advantage and we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed that are well above our cost of capital. So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

Well look, we have indicated that we will be able to pay at least $0.08 a year through 2014. We've looked at this each year, we saw several key projects coming on late next year, in New Jersey, New York and obviously, with Southern Hills and Sand Hills, so we saw an opportunity where we can do a little bit more this year, trying to balance out the needs of investors to get total shareholder return and makeup of dividends and earnings. But I wouldn't suggest that changes the policy on that or that commitment to at least $0.08 a year. The payout ratio, look, that's going to move up and down. As you know, Ted, in the last several years, well, we've been targeting 65%. We never hit 60% given the strong earnings growth. So I think it's a more longer-term goal to be in that 65% range. In some years, you're going to be above that, some years you're going to be lower than that. With respect to tax policy, yes, we'll have to see how that shakes out. I think it's going to be pretty hectic and chaotic from a tax policy perspective. If they do something on the dividend side and increase the taxes, I guess from a relative perspective, we'll be treated the same as others. If they look at overall tax reform, which is something that's talked about in the next Congress as well. There's a lot of talk about lowering corporate tax rates overall and closing a lot of other loopholes, so that's going to take into some consideration for us. So we'll be watching that closely. If it dramatically changes, then obviously, you look at everything and say, ""What's the best -- A, everything from structure to results going forward based on the current tax policy?"""

As you know, we've said the first thing we'd like to do is do acquisitions because you've got the SEP occurrence. The second thing we'd like to do is organic growth, and third, you'd do drop-downs. So you've seen us do a combination of all those things from Sand Hills, Big Sandy that we bought last year, from build-out of East Tennessee a couple of years ago, Ozark. So we've done a combination of all. We just -- we didn't see anything to buy at this point in time. There's not a bunch of organic growth but obviously we want to keep the units growing there and the Distribution growing and so we had a good asset, one of the good assets we have, the drop-down into the MLP and that's the move that we made. And as you know, we've sold half of our positions, so should there be a need again in the future, that opportunity is there again. So I don't see it as a change, Ted, I just -- it's consistent with what we've been trying to do."

Now, we've typically been able to earn 150 basis points above our regulated rate of return. So we'll look at that again. I will say, I'm quite disappointed, there's a lot of political chaos in Ontario. They don't have an energy policy. And the incentives that we had the last 4 or 5 years have really been beneficial to us as the shareholder, but also to consumers there. We've probably saved consumers $100 million. So yes, that's not something I'm real positive about. It probably goes back to a typical utility type growth, i.e. with the economy."

Two, I think there is some need for some rationalization in the whole Empress area. As you well know, Matt, there are multiple players there. And obviously, we've got about 22% or so of the capacity. But they don't -- that's -- all that capacity isn't needed up there. So I think we've got to think about is there a way for us to rationalize that. Those are probably the 2 biggest things.

Of course, we've got -- I don't know exactly what their situation was and how they came to that decision. We obviously have contracts and those are longer term in nature. In terms of growth for the Horn River, you could say that's a negative because there's not another plant that maybe we can build for a few years. But net-net, I'd say, at least in the near term to medium term, it's positive for us. As you've seen, Matt, eco prices have improved lately. They still got to go some ways but much better than what we saw, say, 4 or 5 months ago. So net-net in the near term, I'd say it's positive; longer term, that's obviously not bullish when somebody decides to not finish a plant."

So we felt it was important to put a key executive in charge of that. Now Doug will have a small team. But there's also a requirement under our agreement with BG that we put some dedicated individuals there. And the real focus over the next 2 or 3 years is around getting regulatory approvals, making sure all the commercial aspects are in place. And of course, working with various stakeholders there and one of the big groups there would obviously be First Nations -- aboriginal folks of which we've had a good experience of dealing with them for more than 55 years in the region, so that's really the focus. With respect to whether we'd invest in an LNG terminal, that has not been our choice today. I guess, I would never say never. But it would have to be a fee-based type structure as you see with pipelines for us to get into that. And typically, in our discussions with the various players there, they like to pretty well control all that themselves. And they're also on the sales side of the product being produced and we would not be on that side. So it's probably a better fit with what you've seen with the BGs and the super majors and the like, actually owning those facilities as opposed us.

So the idea was to set up a separate business unit, have Doug Bloom head that up, not only to corral and bring to fruition the BG opportunity, but also look at other opportunities in British Columbia.

I want to echo John's comments and concern for those of you in the Northeast recovering from the great storm, particularly our customers and employees. As you've seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $179 million or $0.27 per share. Earnings for the quarter are down year-on-year basically because of weak commodity prices affecting earnings at both DCP Midstream and at Empress. However, our other businesses continued to perform well. In fact, on a commodity neutral basis, our year-to-date earnings are very much in line with our expectations. Even with the current weakness in commodity prices, we remain optimistic about longer-term NGL fundamentals. For example, we expect to see growth in propane exports starting later this year and significantly increase ethane demand by the petrochemical sector over the next several years along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in North America. So our view tends to be strong fundamentals and expanding market opportunities longer term. In the near term, we expect some commodity choppiness. But that's nothing we haven't managed through in the past. And fortunately, thanks to the size and strength of the business, we're able to maintain our focus on the longer term and take advantage of the significant growth opportunities before both Spectra Energy and our joint venture DCP. 
As we mentioned last quarter, with the commodity price out environment that exists today, it's not possible to meet our $1.90 earnings per share target for the year. And at this point, we anticipate that commodity prices will have a negative $0.50 to $0.55 impact on our 2012 earnings per share. Of course, there are number of other factors that can affect our earnings either positively or negatively. 
Importantly, our fee-based businesses continued to perform in line with our expectations and our expansion opportunities remained strong and growing. Our fee-based businesses continue to generate strong earnings and cash flows, helping to offset the effects of lower commodity prices. And that's the beauty of Spectra Energy's business, predominantly stable, fee-based earnings that provide a great foundation from which to increase our dividend and deliver commodity neutral earnings growth. As you will recall, we expect to deliver dividend growth of at least $0.08 a year through 2014. Yesterday, we announced that our board has approved a $0.10 per share increase in our dividend, bringing our total annualized dividend to $1.22 per share. This is consistent with our overall strategy to provide total shareholder returns through a combination of earnings and dividend growth, a strategy that has allowed us to deliver total shareholder return of 60% since January 2010. 
We also have a solid roster of expansion projects in execution. They include about $4 billion in Spectra Energy finance projects and more than $4 billion of expansion projects at DCP Midstream. So $8 billion in 2012 to 2014 expansion projects are in execution. And we're starting to see the benefits of projects going into service. 
Highlight just a few of those for you: the Philadelphia Lateral will deliver incremental volumes; a firm natural gas supplier along our Texas Eastern system; our TEAM 2012 project is now in service, fully subscribed and generating revenues. The next phase of our ongoing team projects is TEAM 2014. That project is fully subscribed with a targeted in-service date of late 2014. And we're making excellent progress on the construction of the New Jersey-New York expansion project and we're on pace to achieve our projected in-service date of fourth quarter 2013. 
Hurricane Sandy has certainly cost us a few days of construction but nothing substantial for a project of this size. In British Columbia, the T-North 2012 project is slated for a fourth quarter in-service date. We'll also complete construction of the Fort Nelson North facility in the fourth quarter, followed by an in-service date early in the new year. And as many of you heard during the DCP Analyst Day in Denver a few weeks ago, DCP Midstream will place more than $3 billion of projects into service over the course of just the next 12 months. Given the magnitude of the opportunities ahead, DCP has raised its growth capital investment outlook to $5 billion to $7 billion between 2011 and 2015. 
DCP is building and expanding a number of gas processing plants. They have 4 plants under construction, all proceeding as planned. And when you consider additional opportunities on the drawing board, that could mean some 10 or more new plants built over the next few years. DCP is making great progress on 2 major NGL pipeline projects, Sand Hills and Southern Hills. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire 1/3 in each of these, but I'll come back to that in a minute. With respect to the projects themselves, the Sand Hills Pipeline is being phased into service. Last week, DCP announced that the first phase of the project is now online and has begun providing service in the Eagle Ford with direct connection to Mont Belvieu by year end. The project's second phase, the Permian portion of the pipeline, has advanced and is now due to be in-service in the second quarter of 2013. Southern Hills, which you'll recall will provide NGL transportation from the mid-Continent to Mont Belvieu, has a targeted in-service date of mid-2013. We originally expected both Southern Hills and Sand Hills to be full within the first 3 years of operation. That is now accelerated and we expect volumes to come up quicker based on deals completed and pending. Beyond what's in execution, DCP Midstream has about $2 billion to $3 billion in additional development opportunities, primarily in gathering and processing and NGL infrastructure projects. 
Sand Hills and Southern Hills are outstanding projects. And yesterday, Spectra Energy and our joint venture partner Phillips 66 announced an agreement in which each company will acquire from DCP a 1/3 interest in both pipelines. The transaction is expected to close by the end of November, at which time the 3 companies will each own a 1/3 interest in Sand Hills and Southern Hills and equally fund the remaining capital expenditures. The total investment by Spectra Energy in the 2 pipelines is expected to be between $700 million and $800 million. This agreement is a win-win all the way around; the 2 systems are outstanding NGL pipeline projects that will complement Spectra Energy's existing network of natural gas pipelines. 
As they're placed into service, the pipelines will add attractive, stable earnings and cash flow to our results, and the agreement also signifies continued strong owner support for DCP, ensuring it can continue advancing its attractive growth plans and move quickly on the enormous slate of opportunities before them even when commodity prices are choppy. You can expect DCP Midstream to retain its standing as the largest NGL producer in the U.S. and to enhance its gathering and processing position. You may have seen that Hart Energy recently announced that DCP maintained its ranking as the #1 NGL producer in the country and rose to #2 in natural gas processing. 
Across the rest of Spectra Energy, we've got a robust pipeline of development projects providing additional opportunities to create ongoing value. All of these underlines our expectation to invest up to $20 billion through the end of the decade. And we've made some really good progress on many of these opportunities over the last few months, so I'll provide a couple updates. In the U.S. Transmission sector, we are pursuing $5 billion to $8 billion in development opportunities and are proceeding well with all. Since we spoke with you last quarter, we've embarked on our NEXUS Gas Transmission project with partners DTE Energy and Enbridge. NEXUS will move growing supplies of Utica and Marcellus gas to markets in the Midwest and in Ontario. Upon project completion, Spectra Energy will become a 20% owner in the vector pipeline, a joint venture between DTE Energy and Enbridge. 
We're in the midst of an open season for the AIM Project which expands the pipeline capacity of our existing Algonquin system. The open season, which concludes tomorrow, is yielding high levels of interest and positive momentum. We're also pursuing a number of projects that will serve the growing Florida market for natural gas fire power generation and projects like our Renaissance pipeline that can provide a conduit to other Southeastern markets. 
In Western Canada, we're continuing to pursue opportunities around LNG exports. And in September, we announced plans to jointly develop with BG Group, a new natural gas pipeline from the northeast B.C. to serve BG's proposed LNG export facility in Prince Rupert. The new pipeline represents our next wave of investment opportunity in B.C., and allows us to create value by leveraging surplus B.C. natural gas supplies and facilitating its exports to high demand international markets. We expect to make a final investment decision alongside BG by 2015. 
Underscoring our commitment and focus on LNG infrastructure, we announced that Doug Bloom, who many of you know is President of our Western Canadian business, will now become President of a new Spectra Energy business, Canadian LNG, and lead our efforts in securing LNG opportunities in Western Canada. 
So Spectra is clearly focused on the long term. We have what it takes to deliver attractive growing shareholder return. We have the stable and high-performing businesses and a balanced business model focused on long-term sustainable value creation, a fact borne out by our commitment to dividend and earnings growth. Our asset footprint is unrivaled in our sector. We enjoy that first-mile access to North America's prem and supply regions, and last-mile access to expanding natural gas markets. We operate an industry with strong fundamentals that supports the need for infrastructure. And our financial strength, flexibility, multiple financing vehicles also support earnings and dividend growth. 
With that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will walk you through our third quarter financial performance."
610501,222766261,376078,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 mon",1118,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported ongoing third quarter earnings of $179 million or $0.27 per share compared with $247 million or $0.38 per share in 2011. As you can see, in the first 9 months of this year, we've delivered almost 3 quarters of $1 billion in net income. And year-to-date, our EBIT totaled about $1.5 billion. 
Let's take a look now at EBITDA, which reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our businesses. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $655 million and year-to-date, it totaled more than $2.2 billion. Our current level of cash generation allows us to fund our CapEx program without issuing equity, maintain a solid balance sheet and as we demonstrated yesterday, continue to grow our dividend. 
Now we'll take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $238 million, compared with $235 million in the third quarter of 2011. Quarterly EBIT results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects in line with our expectations and lower operating costs. These benefits were partially offset by lower processing revenues and as anticipated, lower storage revenues. 
Now let's turn to our Distribution operations. Distribution reported third quarter EBIT of $55 million, compared with $50 million last year, mainly due to higher short-term transportation revenues. And as we've mentioned before, 2012 is the last year of our 5-year incentive regulation framework in Ontario, a rate-making approach that has been good for Union Gas and equally important, for our customers. As we near the end of that framework, we were required by our regulator, the Ontario Energy Board, to file for new cost of service rates, to be effective in 2013. Just last week, we received the OEB's decision. While the OEB did approve a small rate increase, it wasn't what we had been expecting. The OEB denied our request to increase equity thickness in our capital structure from the current 36% to our requested 40% and more importantly, they removed virtually all of the previous incentives that provided upside opportunities for both the company and our customers. We are disappointed in the OEB's ruling and will evaluate if and when it makes sense for us to pursue another incentive rate framework going forward. We will continue to assess the effects of the decision and share more details with you in January. 
Let's turn now to Western Canada Transmission & Processing, which reported third quarter EBIT of $83 million compared with $119 million last year. The segment experienced lower earnings at the Empress Natural Gas Liquids business and as anticipated, lower contracted volumes from the conventional production areas such as the Grizzly Valley in British Columbia. These reductions were partially offset by improved results in the Gathering & Processing business driven by higher contracted volumes from expansions in the Horn River and Montney areas of British Columbia. The majority of the $21 million loss at Empress this quarter is due to lower NGL sales prices, predominately for propane and higher input cost. Unless we see a dramatic upturn in propane prices, Empress earnings will remain challenged in the fourth quarter and we could see losses in the $10 million to $15 million range. 
I'll now turn to our Field Services segment which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream. This segment reported third quarter EBIT of $62 million, compared with $134 million in 2011. This $72 million decrease in EBIT was driven by an approximately $90 million reduction due to lower commodity prices. Year to date, the reduction attributable to lower commodity prices was approximately $200 million. Higher plant repairs and maintenance costs related to asset growth also reduced EBIT. We had some partial offsets to these reductions including a gain associated with unit issuances by DCP Midstream's MLP DPM and a reduction in depreciation expense as previously reported. In third quarter 2012, NGL prices for DCP's composite barrel averaged $0.72, more than 40% lower than in the 2011 quarter. NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.81, more than 30% lower than last year and crude oil averaged $92, about the same as in 2011 but the relationship between NGLs and crude decreased from 58% last year to 33% this year. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $25 million to Spectra Energy in the third quarter and $175 million year-to-date. 
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our Other segment reported ongoing net cost of $29 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $23 million last year. Other is comprised primarily of corporate costs, including benefits and captive insurance cost. Interest expense during the quarter was $159 million, compared with $157 million in last year's third quarter. Third quarter income tax expense from continuing operations was $72 million, compared with $108 million last year. The lower tax expense was driven by lower earnings and a lower Canadian effective tax rate. The effective tax rate reflected controlling interest was 29% in the third quarter compared with 30% in 2011. At the end of the quarter, our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at about 56%, unchanged from last quarter. And last month, you may have seen that we issued $500 million in Texas Eastern tenure debt at a rate of 2.8%, the lowest coupon in our debt portfolio. At the quarter's close, we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.9 billion and available liquidity of about $1.7 billion. 
As you've heard this morning, we are continuing our growth focus and we see opportunities to profitably invest about $20 billion through the end of this decade. That investment will allow us to realize significant long-term incremental earnings and cash flow with attractive returns on capital. In turn, our investors benefit from our ability to generate ongoing and attractive dividend growth. At the same time, due to our financial strength and that of our partner, Phillips 66, we are able to help DCP capture attractive growth opportunities in advance of further recovery in NGL prices. 
As we've demonstrated today, we are committed to delivering consistent and predictable dividend increases across commodity and market cycles. That commitment is grounded in confidence that we have considerable financial strength and flexibility to support growth, enhanced by our ability to raise capital at the parent level, at our subsidiaries or through our MLP. We have an expansive asset footprint, featuring our first- and last-mile competitive advantage and we have a proven track record of delivering attractive returns on capital employed that are well above our cost of capital. So with that, let me turn things back over to John so we can open up the lines and entertain your questions."

Well look, we have indicated that we will be able to pay at least $0.08 a year through 2014. We've looked at this each year, we saw several key projects coming on late next year, in New Jersey, New York and obviously, with Southern Hills and Sand Hills, so we saw an opportunity where we can do a little bit more this year, trying to balance out the needs of investors to get total shareholder return and makeup of dividends and earnings. But I wouldn't suggest that changes the policy on that or that commitment to at least $0.08 a year. The payout ratio, look, that's going to move up and down. As you know, Ted, in the last several years, well, we've been targeting 65%. We never hit 60% given the strong earnings growth. So I think it's a more longer-term goal to be in that 65% range. In some years, you're going to be above that, some years you're going to be lower than that. With respect to tax policy, yes, we'll have to see how that shakes out. I think it's going to be pretty hectic and chaotic from a tax policy perspective. If they do something on the dividend side and increase the taxes, I guess from a relative perspective, we'll be treated the same as others. If they look at overall tax reform, which is something that's talked about in the next Congress as well. There's a lot of talk about lowering corporate tax rates overall and closing a lot of other loopholes, so that's going to take into some consideration for us. So we'll be watching that closely. If it dramatically changes, then obviously, you look at everything and say, ""What's the best -- A, everything from structure to results going forward based on the current tax policy?"""

So you've seen us do a combination of all those things from Sand Hills, Big Sandy that we bought last year, from build-out of East Tennessee a couple of years ago, Ozark. So we've done a combination of all. We just -- we didn't see anything to buy at this point in time. There's not a bunch of organic growth but obviously we want to keep the units growing there and the Distribution growing and so we had a good asset, one of the good assets we have, the drop-down into the MLP and that's the move that we made.

Now, we've typically been able to earn 150 basis points above our regulated rate of return. So we'll look at that again. I will say, I'm quite disappointed, there's a lot of political chaos in Ontario. They don't have an energy policy. And the incentives that we had the last 4 or 5 years have really been beneficial to us as the shareholder, but also to consumers there. We've probably saved consumers $100 million. So yes, that's not something I'm real positive about. It probably goes back to a typical utility type growth, i.e. with the economy."

So you're not facing the kind of lower cost of market type breakdown that we saw in the past. So that's one, the contracts will be a different mix next year. Two, I think there is some need for some rationalization in the whole Empress area. As you well know, Matt, there are multiple players there. And obviously, we've got about 22% or so of the capacity. But they don't -- that's -- all that capacity isn't needed up there. So I think we've got to think about is there a way for us to rationalize that. Those are probably the 2 biggest things.

So we felt it was important to put a key executive in charge of that. Now Doug will have a small team. But there's also a requirement under our agreement with BG that we put some dedicated individuals there. And the real focus over the next 2 or 3 years is around getting regulatory approvals, making sure all the commercial aspects are in place. And of course, working with various stakeholders there and one of the big groups there would obviously be First Nations -- aboriginal folks of which we've had a good experience of dealing with them for more than 55 years in the region, so that's really the focus. With respect to whether we'd invest in an LNG terminal, that has not been our choice today. I guess, I would never say never. But it would have to be a fee-based type structure as you see with pipelines for us to get into that. And typically, in our discussions with the various players there, they like to pretty well control all that themselves. And they're also on the sales side of the product being produced and we would not be on that side. So it's probably a better fit with what you've seen with the BGs and the super majors and the like, actually owning those facilities as opposed us.
