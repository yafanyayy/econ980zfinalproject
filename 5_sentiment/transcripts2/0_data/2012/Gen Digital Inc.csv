He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. 
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results, focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Net income, EPS and sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For the December 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.30 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.37 per euro. For the December 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on the website. 
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in those statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprise",1273,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprises and consumers globally. We continue to gain traction with our long-term growth initiatives in the areas of cloud computing, mobile and virtualization. In the December 2011 quarter, we continued to build momentum, as we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of consistent execution. We generated better-than-expected revenue, earnings and deferred revenue results on a constant-currency basis. Our performance was driven by market share gains in backup and strength in enterprise security, including DLP, Managed Security Services and Authentication. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Following on the strength of last year's December quarter results, our focused sales execution, coupled with robust demand for our industry-leading products, drove strong performance across all products and regions. We continue to crosssell the product portfolio, with 41% of our December quarter deals over $1 million, including sales from both of our Enterprise Product segments, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Our Backup business continues to gain market share. Growth in this business was driven by our unique ability to provide integrated deduplication, backup and virtualization solutions in a variety of form factors. Our investments to create industry-leading appliances are paying off as our appliance business continues to exceed our expectations. 
We have signed several large transactions with our NetBackup 5220 appliance, displacing established competitors. Our embedded V-Ray technology continues to differentiate us from the competition. Leading organizations such as FedEx and NBC Universal us Netbackup with V-Ray because of its ability to provide load balanced, indexed and easily recoverable backups in both physical and virtual environments. 
To further extend our lead in Information Management, we are bringing together our on-premise and cloud-based backup archiving eDiscovery and data security solutions. Due to the explosion of electronically stored information, customers are demanding a unified way to proactively classify, retain and discover information, while reducing risk and avoiding costs. With tightened integration of our leading archiving and eDiscovery products, we will better protect information, establish retention policies and streamline the eDiscovery process. 
Along with Advanced Technologies, such as source and targeted deduplication, our Backup Exec Appliance also includes critical system protection to protect the server from attacks. Our Enterprise Security Business delivered strong double-digit results as we continue to extend our lead in Data Loss Prevention, Managed Security Services and Authentication. Competitor displacements drove ongoing stabilization in our Endpoint Security business. Customers are adopting SEP 12, 12.0, our best-in-class endpoint protection product, faster than previous versions and it is already installed on more than 3 million endpoints. For the second year in a row, Symantec surpassed the other vendors, receiving the highest rating in both completeness of vision and ability to execute in the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms. 
Data Loss Prevention continued to outpace the market with double-digit growth driven by organizations needing to safeguard their intellectual property and prevent leakage of their critical data. Our Managed Security Services business closed its largest transaction ever with a global hospitality company, generating another quarter of strong double-digit growth. We're the only MSS provider that has received a top rating from Gartner in all 3 geographies. 
Trust Services and User Authentication had a great quarter as we continued to displace our competitors. We increased our lead in both the premium and value SSL segments as we grew installed base by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. According to Net Kraft, Symantec has more active extended validation SSL certificates in use across the web than all other certificate authorities combined. Our user authentication solution, known as VIP, had another record quarter, driven by solid execution across all geographies. We extended VIP's product leadership by adding intelligent authentication, which includes advanced security technologies, such as system device fingerprinting, user behavior monitoring and geolocation monitoring. 
Our storage and availability management business had a strong sales quarter, driven by the successful release of Storage Foundation High Availability 6.0. Demand for centralized management across physical and virtual Linux, Windows and UNIX platforms was again a major driver of new sales. Today, Linux is the fastest-growing platform for our storage management software as an increasing number of customers are deploying Linux in their IT environments. We continue to partner with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate critical workloads into their private clouds. 
Our Consumer business generated its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year, revenue growth, driven by our multichannel distribution strategy, as well as our award-winning Norton products and services. Our 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet security that won 154 awards to date, more than double that of the top 2 competitors combined. The high quality and performance of our 2012 products have helped us sign a new multiyear agreement with Lenovo to include Norton Internet Security on their Think-branded personal computers. New products and services continued to drive growth for our consumer business. Our online backup business delivered double-digit revenue growth as we continue to expand our go-to-market initiatives. 
For households and small offices with mixed environments of PCs and Macs, Norton Live Ultimate Help Desk now supports Macs and provides customers with an easy-to-use support service. We continue to expand our partnerships with ISVs and ISPs, creating another channel for us to upsell our Norton Live solutions. Our Cloud Services business, known as Symantec.cloud, continued to deliver new value-added services and we have broadened our distribution. During the quarter, a large public-sector customer in Europe, with more than 450,000 users chose Symantec to build out their cloud services with improved security standards. We have also received positive feedback from customers and partners on our new Endpoint Protection and Backup Exec cloud-based solutions. In addition, we are extending our Cloud portfolio with the acquisition of LiveOffice, a cloud-based archiving provider to offer customers a comprehensive information management solution delivered on-premise, in the cloud or as a hybrid solution. 
Now, turning our attention to our mobile offerings, we continue to add new capabilities to our mobile device management solutions to secure and manage smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices. To drive market share gains, we launched a set of services that help enterprises evaluate their mobile security needs and develop defenses against mobile threats and vulnerabilities. By leveraging Symantec's extensive knowledge-based and technical expertise, customers can mitigate risks associated with mobile devices and mobile apps. We are also enhancing our mobile solutions for consumers. We announced new updates for Norton Mobile Security for the Android platform and the availability of our Norton Tablet Security. In addition to protecting against online threats, these offerings provide advanced antitheft capabilities to remotely lock and locate a lost or stolen device. Our Norton Mobile Security offering averaged 270,000 downloads per month, an increase of 50% from the previous quarter. We extended our OEM partnership with LG to include Norton Mobile Security and Norton Tablet Security in their smartphones and their tablet devices. Consumers will also be able to download our Norton Mobile Solution from the Samsung App Store. Our ongoing focus on building device and platform independent solutions as part of our Norton Everywhere initiative has positioned us well to protect consumers anywhere they go. In conclusion, I am pleased with the solid results we delivered in the past 6 quarters and I expect the momentum to continue. We have laid the foundation for continued growth in fiscal year 2013. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."
35000,144757385,210801,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments. Continued consistent execution drove record December quarter revenue and deferred revenue, as well as double-digit earnings per share g",1177,"Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments. Continued consistent execution drove record December quarter revenue and deferred revenue, as well as double-digit earnings per share growth. GAAP revenue totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of 6% versus the December 2010 quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened by approximately 1% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by one percentage point, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 7%. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, revenue would have totaled approximately $1.721 billion, above our guided range. Year-to-date, revenue has grown 8% year-over-year. 
December quarter license revenue declined 1% year-over-year, while content subscription and maintenance revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Year-to-date, license revenue is up 2% and maintenance revenue is up 9% year-over-year. Subscription sales, which are made up of our consumer, authentication and cloud services businesses, accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 37% in the year-ago period. In total, subscription revenue grew 13% year-over-year. Our subscription offerings represent an increasingly significant portion of our new business growth that are not included in our license revenue line. Continued subscription growth, combined with strong maintenance renewals, increased the proportion of December quarter revenue that came off the balance sheet to 70%, up from 67% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $314 million grew 15% and resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, up 20% from the December 2010 period. Year-to-date, EPS has grown 16% year-over-year. 
The Consumer business generated December quarter revenue of $525 million, up 5% year-over-year and benefited from our continued success in selling new products and services to consumers. These new offerings grew 78% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the consumer business in the December quarter. OEM placement fees were lower than we had originally forecast by $10 million, as our OEM partners shipped fewer PCs than expected. 
Turning now to the Enterprise business, solid sales execution continued again this quarter, with large transaction counts hitting all-time highs. We generated a total of 674 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 24% year-over-year and 135 transactions valued at more than $1 million each, up 14% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 78% included multiple products. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated record revenue of $511 million, up 17% year-over-year. The successful release of SEP 12 drove another quarter of growth in our Endpoint Security business, while Data Loss Prevention and Managed Security Services continued to gain share, resulting in double-digit growth. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $617 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the December 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup, archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 10% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. We realized $14 million in revenue from our Clearwell acquisition, in line with our previously provided guidance for the quarter. Revenue from the storage and availability management business was down 10% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date, in line with our expectations. As Enrique mentioned, we're encouraged that our customers continue to acknowledge the strength of our products as evidenced by our storage management business generating strong bookings during the December quarter. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, down 12% year-over-year but flat sequentially, as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. 
Turning now to total company margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.7% for the December 2011 quarter, up 40 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the transition of our consulting services to specialized partners. However, offsetting increases in cost of goods spending were driven by the success of our Appliance business, which we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.2%, up 220 basis points compared to the December 2010 quarter, driven by ongoing expense management, improved operating leverage through revenue growth and lower-than-expected OEM fees. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $403 million. We have generated operating cash flow of $1.214 billion year-to-date, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We exited the December quarter with $2.38 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized $220 million to repurchase 15 million of our shares at an average price of $16.69. 30% of our cash balance was onshore as we exited the December quarter. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and maintain our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of December 2011 was $3.67 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the month of December, the dollar appreciated 3% against the euro, negatively impacting our reported end-of-quarter deferred revenue balance. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, deferred revenue would have totaled approximately $3.716 billion, above our guided range. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March 2012 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.37 and the end-of-period rate of $1.41 per euro in the March 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a 5% decrease from our weighted average rate of $1.37 for the March 2011 quarter. As a result, foreign currency movements would decrease estimates both sequentially and year-over-year. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27.5% and the common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 735 million shares. For the March 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.673 billion during the March 2011 quarter. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 2.8% to 3.4% on an as-reported basis and 4.9% to 5.5% in constant currency. Approximately 69% or $1.2 billion of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. 
The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $15 million and $17 million to our March quarter revenue. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24, as compared to $0.22 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.41 and $0.42, as compared to $0.38 in the year-ago period, up 8% to 10% an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.915 billion  and $3.935 billion, compared to $3.82 billion at the end of March 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 2.5% to 3.0% on an as-reported basis and 4.8% to 5.3% in constant currency. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our operational execution and the solid financial performance across the business. We will continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses while driving long-term growth. And now, I'll turn it back over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

And when you look at that growth in storage, there continues to be demand for our solutions that help customers deduplicate, better manage that whole backup environment. When you look at the current demand for our backup appliances, that continues to be robust, given that growth in information. On the other side, some of the comments I made around the strength in DLP, Managed Security Services, it's clear that people need help thinking about how do they protect their information.

The volumes of data that are out there right now and the growth rate is not allowing people to successfully complete backup of all the critical data in a traditional way. So what they're having to do is drive rearchitecture, which is saying they have to use new technologies, such as deduplication. The second aspect that's driving it is as they move to more virtualized servers, you're also seeing a need to use updated or new technologies that are more efficient at backing up a virtualized server. So you've got a rearchitecture going on in data protection. The other thing that's happening is because data and information is so critical in so many different processes, you're also seeing people having the need to keep some of that data more accessible or online using technologies like archiving. And then lastly, because of the legal issues around the discovery process, you're seeing them have to add new techniques and methodologies around the discovery process. And by the way, that is being done now both on-premise and on the cloud. So you look at that and what you've got is a real rearchitecture of how you think about data protection, Information Management, so forth so that re-architecture really creates, in my opinion, a tailwind for us as they think through how did they get ahead of this problem. When you think about the other side of it, obviously what we do everyday is we have to continue to drive innovation, and so a number of the new capabilities that we're delivering into the marketplace with the new Backup launch are for that improved support for virtual improvements environments, improve deduplication rates, doing deduplication everywhere from the client to the data center. So there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in that market and so we're continuing to do that. The only thing that I think about is over time, and we've talked about this, is we are going to move to more appliances. Our Appliance business keeps doing very well and that will put a little bit of pressure on our margins. And so it's just a different cost structure than our enterprise software license but from a market health, from a competitive perspective on the capabilities that we have, I feel very good about that. And then the only thing, the only headwind that I'm worried about right now is really the pressure on the margins."

So now, coming into your second part of your question.

I think there's improvements in every line of the P&L and that gives me great confidence that over the next several years, we'll continue to be able to drive margin improvement each year.

And what we're always doing, that is saying how do we continue to build our business so that is less dependent on the numbers of PC units that are being shipped? And that's been something that's not a new process for Symantec. It's something we've been working on for some time and so we continue to add new services. We're reviewing proposals for some of the new capabilities. I commented that we are seeing more and more downloads at Norton Mobile Security for Android. And so my expectation is that the core PC software side is going to benefit from our ability to crosssell other components of our portfolio, upsell to the higher price points but I don't expect that, as James commented on a previous question, I don't expect to see an uptick in PC units. And so new customer acquisitions will be relatively stable. I expect the opportunity to be in these other services as we go beyond the PC. So my expectation is we'll continue to track the consumer business, definitely a headwind on PC, definitely a headwind going beyond the PC and a headwind because of the supply chain but I think we just need to continue to build our business around some of the other new services that the consumer business has continued to add."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Net income, EPS and sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For the December 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.30 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.37 per euro. For the December 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on the website. 
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements.

And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprise",1280,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprises and consumers globally. We continue to gain traction with our long-term growth initiatives in the areas of cloud computing, mobile and virtualization. In the December 2011 quarter, we continued to build momentum as we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of consistent execution. We generated better-than-expected revenue, earnings and deferred revenue results on a constant-currency basis. Our performance was driven by market share gains in Backup and strength in Enterprise Security, including DLP, Managed Security Services and Authentication. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Following on the strength of last year's December quarter results, our focused sales execution, coupled with robust demand for our industry-leading products, drove strong performance across all products and regions. We continue to cross-sell the product portfolio with 41% of our December quarter deals over $1 million, including sales from both of our Enterprise product segments, up from 38% in the year ago period. Our Backup business continues to gain market share. Growth in this business was driven by our unique ability to provide integrated deduplication, backup and virtualization solutions in a variety of form factors. Our investments to create industry-leading appliances are paying off as our appliance business continues to exceed our expectations. 
We have signed several large transactions with our NetBackup 5220 appliance, displacing established competitors. Our embedded V-Ray technology continues to differentiate us from the competition. Leading organizations, such as FedEx and NBC Universal use NetBackup with V-Ray because of its ability to provide load balanced, indexed and easily recoverable backups in both physical and virtual environments. 
To further extend our lead in Information Management, we are bringing together our on-premise and cloud-based backup archiving eDiscovery and data security solutions. Due to the explosion of electronically stored information, customers are demanding a unified way to proactively classify, retain and discover information while reducing risk and avoiding costs. With tightened integration of our leading archiving and eDiscovery products, we will better protect information, establish retention policies and streamline the eDiscovery process. 
Along with advanced technologies, such as source and target deduplication, our Backup Exec Appliance also includes critical system protection to protect the server from attacks. Our Enterprise Security business delivered strong double-digit results as we continue to extend our lead in Data Loss Prevention, Managed Security Services and Authentication. Competitor displacements drove ongoing stabilization in our Endpoint Security business. Customers are adopting SEP 12, 12.0, our best-in-class endpoint protection product, faster than previous versions and it is already installed on more than 3 million endpoints. For the second year in a row, Symantec surpassed the other vendors, receiving the highest rating in both completeness of vision and ability to execute in the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms. 
Data Loss Prevention continued to outpace the market with double-digit growth driven by organizations needing to safeguard their intellectual property and prevent leakage of their critical data. Our Managed Security Services business closed its largest transaction ever with a global hospitality company, generating another quarter of strong double-digit growth. We're the only MSS provider that has received a top rating from Gartner in all 3 geographies. 
Trust Services and User Authentication had a great quarter as we continue to displace our competitors. We increased our lead in both the premium and value SSL segments as we grew installed base by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. According to Netcraft, Symantec has more active extended validation SSL certificates in use across the web than all other certificate authorities combined. Our user authentication solution, known as VIP, had another record quarter driven by solid execution across all geographies. We extended VIP's product leadership by adding intelligent authentication, which includes advanced security technologies, such as system device fingerprinting, user behavior monitoring and geolocation monitoring. 
Our storage and availability management business had a strong sales quarter driven by the successful release of Storage Foundation High Availability 6.0. Demand for centralized management across physical and virtual Linux, Windows and UNIX platforms was again a major driver of new sales. Today, Linux is the fastest-growing platform for our storage management software as an increasing number of customers are deploying Linux in their IT environments. We continue to partner with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate critical workloads into their private clouds 
Our Consumer business generated its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth driven by our multichannel distribution strategy as well as our award-winning Norton products and services. Our 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security have won 54 awards to date, more than double that of the top 2 competitors combined. The high quality and performance of our 2012 products have helped us sign a new multiyear agreement with Lenovo to include Norton Internet Security on their Think-branded personal computers. New products and services continue to drive growth for our consumer business. Our online backup business delivered double-digit revenue growth as we continue to expand our go-to-market initiatives. 
For household and small offices with mixed environments of PCs and Macs, NortonLive Ultimate Help Desk now supports Macs and provides customers with an easy-to-use support service. We continue to expand our partnerships with ISVs and ISPs, creating another channel for us to upsell our NortonLive solutions. Our cloud services business, known as Symantec.cloud, continue to deliver new value-added services and we have broadened our distribution. During the quarter, a large public-sector customer in Europe with more than 450,000 users chose Symantec to build out their cloud services with improved security standards. We have also received positive feedback from customers and partners on our new Endpoint Protection and Backup Exec cloud-based solutions. In addition, our extended cloud portfolio -- in addition, we are extending our cloud portfolio with the acquisition of LiveOffice, a cloud-based archiving provider to offer customers a comprehensive information management solution delivered on-premise, in the cloud or as a hybrid solution. 
Now turning our attention to our mobile offerings. We continue to add new capabilities to our mobile device management solutions to secure and manage smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices. To drive market share gains, we launched a set of services that help enterprises evaluate their mobile security needs and develop defenses against mobile threats and vulnerabilities. By leveraging Symantec's extensive knowledge base and technical expertise, customers can mitigate risks associated with mobile devices and mobile apps. We are also enhancing our mobile solutions for consumers. We announced new updates for Norton Mobile Security for the Android platform and the availability of our Norton Tablet Security. In addition to protecting against online threats, these offerings provide advanced antitheft capabilities to remotely lock and locate a lost or stolen device. Our Norton Mobile Security offering averaged 270,000 downloads per month, an increase of 50% from the previous quarter. We expanded our OEM partnership with LG to include Norton Mobile Security and Norton Tablet Security in their smartphones and their tablet devices. Consumers will also be able to download our Norton mobile solution from the Samsung App Store. Our ongoing focus on building device and platform independent solutions as part of our Norton Everywhere initiative has positioned us well to protect consumers anywhere they go. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with the solid results we delivered in the past 6 quarters and I expect the momentum to continue. We have laid the foundation for a continued growth in fiscal year 2013. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."

Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments. Continued consistent execution drove record December quarter revenue and deferred revenue as well as double-digit earnings per share growth. GAAP revenue totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of 6% versus the December 2010 quarter. U.S. dollar weakened by approximately 1% against the euro as compared to the year ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by one percentage point, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 7%. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, revenue would have totaled approximately $1.721 billion, above our guided range. Year-to-date, revenue has grown 8% year-over-year. 
December quarter license revenue declined 1% year-over-year, while content subscription and maintenance revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Year-to-date, license revenue is up 2% and maintenance revenue is up 9% year-over-year. Subscription sales, which are made up of our consumer, authentication and cloud services businesses, accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 37% in the year ago period. In total, subscription revenue grew 13% year-over-year. Our subscription offerings represent an increasingly significant portion of our new business growth that are not included in our license revenue line. Continued subscription growth, combined with strong maintenance renewals, increased the proportion of December quarter revenue that came off the balance sheet to 70%, up from 67% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $314 million grew 15% and resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, up 20% from the December 2010 period. Year-to-date, EPS has grown 16% year-over-year. 
The Consumer business generated December quarter revenue of $525 million, up 5% year-over-year and benefited from our continued success in selling new products and services to consumers. These new offerings grew 78% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the Consumer business in the December quarter. OEM placement fees were lower than we had originally forecast by $10 million, as our OEM partners shipped fewer PCs than expected. 
Turning now to the Enterprise business. Solid sales execution continued again this quarter with large transaction counts hitting all-time highs. We generated a total of 674 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 24% year-over-year and 135 transactions valued at more than $1 million each, up 14% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 78% included multiple products. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated record revenue of $511 million, up 17% year-over-year. The successful release of SEP 12 drove another quarter of growth in our Endpoint Security business, while Data Loss Prevention and Managed Security Services continue to gain share, resulting in double-digit growth. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $617 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the December 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup, archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 10% year-over-year driven by our differentiated deduplication and the virtual machine protection features. We realized $14 million in revenue from our Clearwell acquisition, in line with our previously provided guidance for the quarter. Revenue from the Storage and Availability Management business was down 10% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date, in line with our expectations. As Enrique mentioned, we're encouraged that our customers continue to acknowledge the strength of our products as evidenced by our Storage Management business generating strong bookings during the December quarter. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, down 12% year-over-year but flat sequentially, as we continue to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.7% for the December 2011 quarter, up 40 basis points from the year ago period, reflecting the transition of our consulting services to specialized partners. However, offsetting increases in cost of goods spending were driven by the success of our Appliance business, which we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.2%, up 220 basis points compared to the December 2010 quarter driven by ongoing expense management, improved operating leverage through revenue growth and lower-than-expected OEM fees. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $403 million. We have generated operating cash flow of $1.214 billion year-to-date, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We exited the December quarter with $2.38 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized $220 million to repurchase 15 million of our shares at an average price of $16.69. 30% of our cash balance was onshore as we exited the December quarter. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and maintain our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of December 2011 was $3.67 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the month of December, the dollar appreciated 3% against the euro, negatively impacting our reported end-of-quarter deferred revenue balance. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, deferred revenue would have totaled approximately $3.716 billion, above our guided range. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March 2012 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.37 and the end-of-period rate of $1.41 per euro in the March 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a 5% decrease from our weighted average rate of $1.37 for the March 2011 quarter. As a result, foreign currency movements would decrease estimates both sequentially and year-over-year. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27.5% and the common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 735 million shares. For the March 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion as compared to revenue of $1.673 billion during the March 2011 quarter. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 2.8% to 3.4% on an as-reported basis and 4.9% to 5.5% in constant currency. Approximately 69% or $1.2 billion of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. 
The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $15 million and $17 million to our March quarter revenue. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.22 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.41 and $0.42 as compared to $0.38 in the year ago period, up 8% to 10% on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.915 billion and $3.935 billion compared to $3.82 billion at the end of March 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 2.5% to 3.0% on an as-reported basis and 4.8% to 5.3% in constant currency. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our operational execution and the solid financial performance across the business. We will continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses while driving long-term growth. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

The volumes of data that are out there right now and the growth rate is not allowing people to successfully complete backup of all the critical data in a traditional way. So what they're having to do is drive rearchitecture, which is saying they have to use new technologies, such as deduplication. The second aspect that's driving it is, as they move to more virtualized servers, you're also seeing a need to use updated or new technologies that are more efficient at backing up a virtualized server. So you've got a rearchitecture going on in data protection. The other thing that's happening is, because data and information is so critical in so many different processes, you're also seeing people having the need to keep some of that data more accessible or online using technologies like archiving. And then lastly, because of the legal issues around the discovery process, you're seeing them have to add new techniques and methodologies around the discovery process. And by the way, this is being done now both on-premise and in the cloud. So you look at that and what you've got is a real rearchitecture of how you think about data protection, Information Management and so forth, so that rearchitecture really creates, in my opinion, a tailwind for us as they think through how do they get ahead of this problem. When you think about the other side of it, obviously, what we do everyday is we have to continue to drive innovation. And so a number of the new capabilities that we're delivering into the marketplace with the new Backup launch are that improved support for virtual environments, improved deduplication rates, doing deduplication everywhere from the client to the data center. And so there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in that market, and so we're continuing to do that. The only thing that I think about is over time, and we've talked about this, is we are going to move to more appliances. Our Appliance business keeps doing very well and that will put a little bit of pressure on our margins. And so it's just a different cost structure than our enterprise software license. But from a market health, from a competitive perspective on the capabilities that we have, I feel very good about that. And then the only thing, the only headwind, that I'm worried about right now is really the -- with the pressure on the margins."

When we look at the sales force and sales productivity, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the Enterprise segments. When I look at the large deal productivity, the metric -- I think James gave 135 deals over $1 million. When I look at the cross-selling where 41% of the deals include products from both our security business and our Storage and Server Management business, we absolutely are being able to articulate a vision that says to customers the range of our products can help you deal with new information growth and information security problems. And so sales force for productivity has continued to improve over the last 3 years. At the last Analyst Day, Bill Robbins talked about some metrics around expense to bookings, expense to billings, and my expectation is that that metric should continue to improve, not just this year, but again next year. And I expect that to continue the year after that. And so as you know, we've been working over, I would say probably the last 5 years to continue to improve that metric and I expect it to continue. So now, coming into your second part of your question, some of the improvements in expansion and margin will come from continued improvements in sales, but I actually believe we'll see improvements across all parts of the business. I think there's improvements in every line of the P&L, and that gives me great confidence that over the next several years, we'll continue to be able to drive margin improvement each year. Obviously, I want to make sure that some of the improvement comes from top line growth, but we're absolutely going to drive better cost management, cost containment, which we've been doing over the last several years, and I expect that to continue."

And so that will put upward pressure on our deal size, because instead of just by archiving, we're going to show you a compelling reason why you should buy our archiving and our discovery.

As far as new technologies, we're at the forefront of file system performance, at the forefront of clustering technologies. We're showing people right now how they can more effectively build their private clouds using our technology. I was just in our Executive briefing center yesterday. And one of the things that's resonating very well with customers is we're saying, ""Look, use the existing infrastructure you have, your storage infrastructure, your computing infrastructure more effectively."" When you're trying to build that private cloud, what you're really trying to do is get better utilization of all of your IT resources, not just your hardware assets, but also your people assets. And so using our technologies, we're able to show customers how we use the file system and clustering technologies to build out that private cloud in a highly scalable, highly cost-effective way.

So then when you extend it to the other components of our data protection suite, our goal is to continue to bring in the other components. We absolutely have differentiated technology date. Clearwell is the market leader in eDiscovery; LiveOffice, best-in-class, hosted archiving technology; NetBackup, market leader in backup software.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Net income, EPS and sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For the December 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.30 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.37 per euro. For the December 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on the website. 
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in those statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."
35000,144757385,210924,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprise",1278,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprises and consumers globally. We continue to gain traction with our long-term growth initiatives in the areas of cloud, computing, mobile and virtualization. In the December 2011 quarter, we continued to build momentum as we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of consistent execution. We generated better-than-expected revenue, earnings and deferred revenue results on a constant-currency basis. Our performance was driven by market share gains in Backup and strength in Enterprise Security, including DLP, Managed Security Services and Authentication. 
Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Following on the strength of last year's December quarter results, our focused sales execution coupled with robust demand for our industry-leading products drove strong performance across all products and regions. We continue to cross-sell the product portfolio with 41% of our December quarter deals over $1 million, including sales from both of our Enterprise product segments, up from 38% in the year ago period. Our Backup business continues to gain market share. Growth in this business was driven by our unique ability to provide integrated deduplication, backup and virtualization solutions in a variety of form factors. Our investments to create industry-leading appliances are paying off as our Appliance business continues to exceed our expectations. 
We have signed several large transactions with our NetBackup 5220 appliance, displacing established competitors. Our embedded V-Ray technology continues to differentiate us from the competition. Leading organizations such as FedEx and NBC Universal use NetBackup with V-Ray because of its ability to provide load-balanced, indexed and easily recoverable backups in both physical and virtual environments. 
To further extend our lead in Information Management, we are bringing together our on-premise and cloud-based backup, archiving, eDiscovery and data security solutions. Due to the explosion of electronically stored information, customers are demanding a unified way to proactively classify, retain and discover information while reducing risk and avoiding costs. With tightened integration of our leading archiving and eDiscovery products, we will better protect information, establish retention policies and streamline the eDiscovery process. 
Along with advanced technologies such as source and target deduplication our Backup Exec Appliance also includes critical system protection to protect the server from attacks. Our Enterprise Security business delivered strong double-digit results as we continue to extend our lead in Data Loss Prevention, Managed Security Services and Authentication. Competitor displacements drove ongoing stabilization in our Endpoint Security business. Customers are adopting SEP 12, 12.0, our best-in-class endpoint protection product, faster than previous versions, and it is already installed on more than 3 million endpoints. For the second year in a row, Symantec surpassed the other vendors, receiving the highest rating in both completeness of vision and ability to execute in the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms. 
Data Loss Prevention continued to outpace the market with double-digit growth driven by organizations needing to safeguard their intellectual property and prevent leakage of their critical data. Our Managed Security Services business closed its largest transaction ever with a global hospitality company, generating another quarter of strong double-digit growth. We're the only MSS provider that has received a top rating from Gartner in all 3 geographies. 
Trust Services and User Authentication had a great quarter as we continue to displace our competitors. We increased our lead in both the premium and value SSL segments as we grew our install base by double-digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. According to Netcraft, Symantec has more active extended validation SSL certificates in use across the web than all other certificate authorities combined. Our user authentication solution, known as VIP, had another record quarter driven by solid execution across all geographies. We extended VIP's product leadership by adding intelligent authentication, which includes advanced security technologies such as system device fingerprinting, user behavior monitoring and geolocation monitoring. 
Our storage and availability management business had a strong sales quarter driven by the successful release of Storage Foundation High Availability 6.0. Demand for centralized management across physical and virtual Linux, Windows and UNIX platforms was again a major driver of new sales. Today, Linux is the fastest-growing platform for our storage management software as an increasing number of customers are deploying Linux in their IT environments. We continue to partner with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate critical workloads into their private clouds.
Our Consumer business generated its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, driven by our multichannel distribution strategy as well as our award-winning Norton products and services. Our 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security have won 54 awards to date, more than double that of the top 2 competitors combined. The high quality and performance of our 2012 products have helped us sign a new multiyear agreement with Lenovo to include Norton Internet Security on their Think-branded personal computers. New products and services continue to drive growth for our consumer business. Our online backup business delivered double-digit revenue growth as we continue to expand our go-to-market initiatives. 
For household and small offices with mixed environments of PCs and Macs, NortonLive Ultimate Help Desk now supports Macs and provides customers with an easy-to-use support service. We continue to expand our partnerships with ISVs and ISPs, creating another channel for us to upsell our NortonLive solutions. Our cloud services business, known as Symantec.cloud, continue to deliver new value-added services, and we have broadened our distribution. During the quarter, a large public-sector customer in Europe with more than 450,000 users chose Symantec to build out their cloud services with improved security standards. We have also received positive feedback from customers and partners on our new Endpoint Protection and Backup Exec cloud-based solutions. In addition, our extended cloud portfolio -- in addition, we are extending our cloud portfolio with the acquisition of LiveOffice, a cloud-based archiving provider to offer customers a comprehensive information management solution delivered on-premise, in the cloud or as a hybrid solution. 
Now turning our attention to our mobile offerings. We continue to add new capabilities to our mobile device management solutions to secure and manage smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices. To drive market share gains, we launched a set of services that help enterprises evaluate their mobile security needs and develop defenses against mobile threats and vulnerabilities. By leveraging Symantec's extensive knowledge base and technical expertise, customers can mitigate risks associated with mobile devices and mobile apps. We are also enhancing our mobile solutions for consumers. We announced new updates for Norton Mobile Security for the Android platform and the availability of our Norton Tablet Security. In addition to protecting against online threats, these offerings provide advanced antitheft capabilities to remotely lock and locate a lost or stolen device. Our Norton Mobile Security offering averaged 270,000 downloads per month, an increase of 50% from the previous quarter. We expanded our OEM partnership with LG to include Norton Mobile Security and Norton Tablet Security in their smartphones and their tablet devices. Consumers will also be able to download our Norton mobile solution from the Samsung App Store. Our ongoing focus on building device and platform-independent solutions as part of our Norton Everywhere initiative has positioned us well to protect consumers anywhere they go. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with the solid results we delivered in the past 6 quarters, and I expect the momentum to continue. We have laid the foundation for a continued growth in fiscal year 2013. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."
35000,144757385,210924,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments.

Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments. Continued consistent execution drove record December quarter revenue and deferred revenue as well as double-digit earnings per share growth. GAAP revenue totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of 6% versus the December 2010 quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened by approximately 1% against the euro as compared to the year ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by one percentage point, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 7%. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, revenue would have totaled approximately $1.721 billion, above our guided range. Year-to-date, revenue has grown 8% year-over-year. 
December quarter license revenue declined 1% year-over-year, while content subscription and maintenance revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Year-to-date, license revenue is up 2% and maintenance revenue is up 9% year-over-year. Subscription sales, which are made up of our consumer, authentication and cloud services businesses, accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 37% in the year ago period. In total, subscription revenue grew 13% year-over-year. Our subscription offerings represent an increasingly significant portion of our new business growth but are not included in our license revenue line. Continued subscription growth, combined with strong maintenance renewals, increased the proportion of December quarter revenue that came off the balance sheet to 70%, up from 67% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $314 million grew 15% and resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, up 20% from the December 2010 period. Year-to-date, EPS has grown 16% year-over-year. 
The Consumer business generated December quarter revenue of $525 million, up 5% year-over-year, and benefited from our continued success in selling new products and services to consumers. These new offerings grew 78% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the Consumer business in the December quarter. OEM placement fees were lower than we had originally forecast by $10 million, as our OEM partners shipped fewer PCs than expected. 
Turning now to the Enterprise business. Solid sales execution continued again this quarter with large transaction counts hitting all-time highs. We generated a total of 674 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 24% year-over-year, and 135 transactions valued at more than $1 million each, up 14% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 78% included multiple products. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated record revenue of $511 million, up 17% year-over-year. The successful release of SEP 12 drove another quarter of growth in our Endpoint Security business, while Data Loss Prevention and Managed Security Services continued to gain share, resulting in double-digit growth. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $617 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the December 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup, archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 10% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. We realized $14 million in revenue from our Clearwell acquisition, in line with our previously provided guidance for the quarter. Revenue from the Storage and Availability Management business was down 10% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date, in line with our expectations. As Enrique mentioned, we're encouraged that our customers continue to acknowledge the strength of our products, as evidenced by our Storage Management business generating strong bookings during the December quarter. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, down 12% year-over-year but flat sequentially, as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.7% for the December 2011 quarter, up 40 basis points from the year ago period, reflecting the transition of our consulting services to specialized partners. However, offsetting increases in cost of goods spending were driven by the success of our Appliance business, which we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.2%, up 220 basis points compared to the December 2010 quarter driven by ongoing expense management, improved operating leverage through revenue growth and lower-than-expected OEM fees. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $403 million. We have generated operating cash flow of $1.214 billion year-to-date, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We exited the December quarter with $2.38 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized $220 million to repurchase 13 million of our shares at an average price of $16.69. 30% of our cash balance was onshore as we exited the December quarter. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and maintain our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
GAAP deferred revenue at the end of December 2011 was $3.67 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the month of December, the dollar appreciated 3% against the euro, negatively impacting our reported end-of-quarter deferred revenue balance. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, deferred revenue would have totaled approximately $3.716 billion, above our guided range. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March 2012 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.37 and the end-of-period rate of $1.41 per euro in the March 2011 quarter. Our $1.30-per-euro assumption reflects a 5% decrease from our weighted average rate of $1.37 for the March 2011 quarter. As a result, foreign currency movements would decrease estimates both sequentially and year-over-year. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27.5% and a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 735 million shares. For the March 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.673 billion during the March 2011 quarter. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 2.8% to 3.4% on an as-reported basis and 4.9% to 5.5% in constant currency. Approximately 69%, or $1.2 billion, of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. 
The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $15 million and $17 million to our March quarter revenue. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.22 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.41 and $0.42 as compared to $0.38 in the year ago period, up 8% to 10% on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.915 billion and $3.935 billion compared to $3.82 billion at the end of March 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 2.5% to 3.0% on an as-reported basis and 4.8% to 5.3% in constant currency. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our operational execution and the solid financial performance across the business. We will continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses while driving long-term growth. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

The volumes of data that are out there right now and the growth rate is not allowing people to successfully complete backup of all the critical data in a traditional way. So what they're having to do is drive rearchitecture, which is saying they have to use new technologies, such as deduplication. The second aspect that's driving it is, as they move to more virtualized servers, you're also seeing a need to use updated or new technologies that are more efficient at backing up a virtualized server. So you've got a rearchitecture going on in data protection. The other thing that's happening is, because data and information is so critical in so many different processes, you're also seeing people having the need to keep some of that data more accessible or online using technologies like archiving. And then lastly, because of the legal issues around the discovery process, you're seeing them have to add new techniques and methodologies around the discovery process. And by the way, this is being done now both on-premise and in the cloud. So you look at that, and what you've got is a real rearchitecture of how you think about data protection, Information Management and so forth, so that rearchitecture really creates, in my opinion, a tailwind for us as they think through how do they get ahead of this problem. When you think about the other side of it, obviously, what we do every day is we have to continue to drive innovation. And so a number of the new capabilities that we're delivering into the marketplace with the new Backup launch are that improved support for virtual environments, improved deduplication rates, doing deduplication everywhere, from the client to the data center. And so there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in that market, and so we're continuing to do that. The only thing that I think about is over time, and we've talked about this, is we are going to move to more appliances. Our Appliance business keeps doing very well, and that will put a little bit of pressure on our margins. And so it's just a different cost structure than an enterprise software license. But from a market health, from a competitive perspective on the capabilities that we have, I feel very good about that. And then the only thing, the only headwind that I'm worried about right now is really the -- with the pressure on the margins."

And so sales force productivity has continued to improve over the last 3 years. At the last Analyst Day, Bill Robbins talked about some metrics around expense to bookings, expense to billings, and my expectation is that, that metric should continue to improve, not just this year, but again next year. And I expect that to continue the year after that. And so as you know, we've been working over, I would say, probably the last 5 years to continue to improve that metric, and I expect it to continue. So now, coming into your second part of your question, some of the improvements in expansion and margin will come from continued improvements in sales, but I actually believe we'll see improvements across all parts of the business. I think there's improvements in every line of the P&L, and that gives me great confidence that over the next several years, we'll continue to be able to drive margin improvement each year.

The other thing that we're doing with DLP this quarter is we're delivering our DLP for tablets, which has been in very high demand because people are using more. I think you saw yesterday in iPad numbers where I think there were 15 million iPads sold in the December quarter, and a number of those iPads end up in the enterprise. And so customers are absolutely looking forward to the ability to use our DLP technology on their tablet devices. As far as the other part of your question, James, do you want to talk about the..."

What we're able to do with our 5240 appliances is integrate all of that. So then when you extend it to the other components of our data protection suite, our goal is to continue to bring in the other components. We absolutely have differentiated technology date [ph]. Clearwell is the market leader in eDiscovery; LiveOffice, best-in-class, hosted archiving technology; NetBackup, market leader in backup software. We put all that together in one integrated solution, I think you're absolutely right, that should start distancing us from the competition, because no one has the market-leading, best-of-breed technologies in the different areas that I've described.

And that's been something that's not a new process for Symantec. It's something that we've been working on for some time. And so we continue to add new services. We're reviewing proposals for some of the new capabilities. I commented that we're seeing more and more downloads of our Norton Mobile Security for Android. And so my expectation is that the core PC software side is going to benefit for our ability to cross-sell other components of our portfolio, upsell to the higher price points. But I don't expect that -- as James commented on a previous question, I don't expect to see an uptick in PC units, and so new customer acquisition will be relatively stable.

I would tell you that, as I look at data that we have available, some of those vendors are struggling with some of their monetization models, and I expect that they're going to continue to struggle going forward, because their business model is going to get challenged as they try to upsell to some of the services, because we've got a better market position with better services, and I'm convinced that we'll be able to effectively compete with anybody who is offering a freemium product.

We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on our website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangible and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements.

Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP result, which can be found in the press release and on our website.

35000,172345754,295542,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings h",1106,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings however, exceeded our internal plans and the underlying billings activity came in line with our expectations. This resulted in greater billings going to the balance sheet, driving stronger-than-expected deferred revenue. Despite the March quarter results, fiscal year 2012 was a record year for Symantec. We executed on our strategy to strengthen our core businesses, while continuing to grow our emerging businesses. We laid the foundation to capitalize on key initiatives in cloud, mobile and virtualization. We developed a number of important innovative technologies that support our strategy. We expanded our portfolio of SaaS-delivered solutions and recently launched 03, our new security service for the cloud. We also introduced multiple mobile application and device management solutions and DLP for tablets. Furthermore, we strengthened our partnership with VMware to provide storage solutions that facilitate virtualization of critical applications. 
In our core businesses, we launched the best performing Enterprise Endpoint Protection product according to industry analysts. We successfully released our Backup Appliances with better-than-expected results and launched the industry's first membership offering for consumer security. We are continuing to make progress in penetrating the SMB segment where there's more opportunity to grow. We successfully reversed the downward trend in our core Enterprise Endpoint Security business, which saw its third consecutive quarter of bookings growth, driven by SEP 12's award-winning product launch. 
Our Trust Services business also performed well. This is a market many believe to be in decline when we bought it, yet the team's focused execution has driven growth and share gains across both the premium and value segments of the certificate market. Our emerging businesses contributed to bookings growth during the fiscal year 2012. User Authentication, designed to protect identities, had another record quarter. Managed Security Services continued to gain share as customers relied on our security expertise to help them deal with the targeted threat environment. We simplified our pricing structure, which has both streamlined the buying process for our customers and improved our margins through better alignment of cost and value. We signed a number of new MSS contracts across geographies, highlighted by an important win at a major German bank. Our SaaS Security Services also grew as cloud delivery is increasingly the preferred solution for Mail and Web Security. 
As all of these growth drivers are subscription offerings, sales go to the balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue in the coming quarters. In the fourth quarter, we laid the foundation for both our cloud and mobile solutions. In order to help customers with the key trend of bring-your-own-device, we acquired 2 mobile companies to round out our capabilities. Being able to offer customers mobile device and application management allows employees to use their personal devices in the workplace without having to compromise security or the native user experience. We also launched Phase 1 of 03, our identity and Access Control service, enabling single sign-on for third-party cloud applications. We have received positive early responses to this service from a variety of customers. 
With storage costs making up 17% of IT budget according to Forrester, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to manage their data in more efficient ways. Symantec enables customers to use virtualization technologies and the cloud to lower IT costs and confidently back up, recover, archive and discover information. Our Information Management products protect and archive physical and virtual machines using integrated market-leading capabilities. During the year, we strengthened our partnership with VMware. We developed innovative technologies, such as V-Ray and provided advanced capability for source and target deduplication. In addition, we successfully delivered industry-leading backup appliances, which have driven incremental new business and have displaced established competitors. 
In the fourth quarter, we refreshed our Backup products for the Enterprise and SMB segments. We differentiated ourselves by providing up to 100X faster backup speed and integrating with NetApp's snapshots. We leveraged our unique technologies across multiple delivery models, including cloud, fully integrated appliances and traditional on-premise software. We will continue driving the penetration of our appliances into new and developed markets, integrating our complementary E-Discovery and archiving capabilities and cross-selling these higher-growth businesses into our installed base. 
Our storage management business received several large renewals from top telco and financial sector customers, reiterating our customers' commitment to these products and the value of these relationships. Our largest storage management customers use both our backup and storage management products to better protect and manage their information. We will continue to expand our partnerships with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate business-critical workloads into their private clouds. The increasing momentum towards the Linux platform and data center modernization will continue to be the primary opportunity drivers going forward. This business generates an important source of cash and profits for the company. 
Our consumer business generated 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We maintained our consumer security leadership during the global decline in PC shipments that was felt most acutely in the developed markets, where the attach rates are much higher than in the emerging markets. In our beyond-the-PC offerings, our cloud backup Services and NortonLive services continue to generate strong growth. Norton Online Backup now has 14 million users. This solution is an important part of our consumer protection portfolio and has proven to be an important driver of our renewals. Our smartphone and tablet solution, Norton Mobile Security, is also available as an app in the Android market and has received a 4.3 star rating. Today's consumer accesses information on a broader array of devices than the PC. Our recently launched Norton One service enables this trend by ensuring information protection moves with the consumer. Norton One, the industry's first membership offering, represents a new paradigm in consumer information protection. This premium service provides comprehensive protection across multiple devices, providing personalized experience and dedicated support, all managed through a single cloud-based interface. 
In conclusion, while I'm disappointed with the lower-than-expected revenue results in the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the 9% revenue growth we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We will continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses and growing our emerging opportunities. We are excited about the roadmap for fiscal year 2013 and have many of the foundational elements in place to grow our business. This is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."

As we discussed on our preliminary update call last week, our bookings missed our expectations for the fourth quarter, with a year-over-year decline of 26% in license sales and a larger percentage of ratable subscription sales, cost revenue and EPS to come in below our expectations. The higher subscription sales caused more of our billings activity to be recorded on the balance sheet, resulting in a higher deferred revenue balance. For fiscal year 2012, we reported record results for each of our key financial metrics and across all of our geographies. This performance was driven by strength in our backup, SaaS, DLP and Managed Security Services offerings, as well as the results of our recently acquired businesses. 
First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011. As-reported revenue grew 9% and reached a record $6.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 6%. Acquisitions accounted for $54 million in revenue, resulting in 1% organic constant currency growth for fiscal 2012. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 7%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 3%. Subscription revenue grew 15% and accounted for 43% of total revenue compared to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Enterprise subscriptions grew 40% and accounted for 12% of total revenue as compared to 9% of revenue in the prior year. International revenue grew 7% to $3.49 billion and represented 52% of total revenue. The Americas grew 7%; Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 14%; and the Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 1%. As a result of our billings performance, we exited the year with a record $3.97 billion in deferred revenue, up 5%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% was down 20 basis points and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $1.61. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% from fiscal 2011 on an as-reported basis. Capital expenditures totaled $286 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.615 billion for the fiscal year. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance totaled $3.2 billion, with approximately 28% of this amount residing onshore. During the year, we spent $893 million to  repurchase 51 million shares at an average share price of $17.62, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 6.5% or a net 4.3%, after adjusting for the issuance of employee stock compensation. 
Now I'll review the financial details of the March 2012 quarter compared to the March 2011 period. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year and totaled $1.681 billion. Clearwell generated revenue of $13 million, below what we were expecting due to increased competitive pricing in the E-Discovery litigation service provider channel. LiveOffice generated $4 million in revenue, coming in better than plan. For the fourth quarter, our organic constant currency revenue declined 2% year-over-year. As we mentioned last week, license revenue declined 26% year-over-year, in part as a result of record license sales in the year-ago period and the continuing shift towards subscription-based products and services. Content and maintenance revenue continued to grow steadily, increasing 4% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 10% and accounted for 41% of total revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscription sales grew 30% year-over-year. Across the Enterprise business, we closed a total of 487 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each. approximately equal to the number in the year-ago period. 128 of these transactions generated more than $1 million of bookings, up 7% year-over-year. The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year, driven by strength in MSS, SaaS and Authentication Services. Our Endpoint Security business also grew for the third consecutive quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment decreased 5% as compared to the March 2011 quarter, driven by weakness in our storage management business and a pause in sales before the launch of our new Backup Exec product. Revenue from our backup, archiving and E-Discovery business was down 3% year-over-year but our newly launched Appliance business continued to exceed expectations, more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. 
Revenue from our storage management business decreased 8% year-over-year, driven by lower license sales than in the year ago period. The consumer business was up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our new cloud and service offerings, as well as improving renewal rates in the core business. The new service offerings grew 54% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth. OEM placement fees were greater than our forecast by $5.4 million as our OEM partners shipped more units than they had originally forecasted. For the June quarter, we expect PC shipments to increase as our OEM partners ship more units into emerging countries, which have lower software attach rates. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $64 million as we continued to transition our consulting practices to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 17% as compared to 7% in the March 2011 quarter. 
Turning now to total company margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6% for the March 2012 quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year on increasing appliance and SaaS sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2%, down 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by weaker-than-expected revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%, below our guidance of 27% due to several onetime items being resolved favorably during the quarter. 
We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $687 million. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $17.88. 
We are reaffirming the guidance we provided last week. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro, a decrease of 8% versus the weighted average rate of $1.44 and the end of period rate of $1.45 per euro from the June 2011 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 725 million shares. Thus, for the June 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.66 billion as compared to revenue of $1.653 billion during the June 2011 quarter. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to be up 2.4% to 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. We expect Clearwell and LiveOffice to generate combined revenue of between $11 million and $15 million in the June period. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.18 and $0.19 as compared to $0.25 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.37 and $0.38 as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period, down 1.5% to up 1% after adjusting for currency. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.715 billion and $3.735 billion compared to $3.689 billion at the end of June 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up between 2.8% and 3.4% in constant currency. 74% or $1.23 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. This is the highest deferred revenue roll-off percentage we've seen to date. 
In conclusion, although our recognized revenue was weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong bookings performance generated in fiscal year 2012. We remain focused on consistent execution and managing our expenses judicially to drive top line organic growth in the coming fiscal year. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn to begin pooling for your questions."

So as the quarters go by, I would expect that to normalize more in line with the true organic blended rate of the SSL business, with the higher organic growth rates of the other of our subscription services businesses. So I would expect it to come down somewhat over time. In terms of the margin around the storage management side of the business, I would certainly expect the backup performance to be improving in coming quarters. We talked in our remarks about some of the polls around Backup exec products that were released of bad new offering. We also have a version of NetBackup into the marketplace. And so as those license-oriented sales rise, I would expect margins to rise as well versus what we recorded in the March quarter."

And as we book longer-term deals, so, for example, our cloud-based services, we look at total contract value or commitment over 3-year period. So for example, we give credit for somebody who closes a 3-year .cloud deal. And that's 3 years worth of credit. So it's important to note that some of the bookings are not going to show up in revenue and deferred revenue. They're actually going to show up in years 2 and 3. That's also the case for MSS and a couple of our other businesses. So the total activity, because what we're trying to do is get customers to commit to longer subscriptions with us and that's been our practice over the years, Brad."

And the bench price bookings drive the volatility that we saw, that the lower enterprise revenue that we saw, driven by that mixed shift away from traditional license to a more subscription activity that we've been talking about. Now the consumer side of the business has obviously a very different profile in terms of the way the bookings build during the quarter. It's a much more linear approach throughout the quarter. So the consumer business came in close to where we would've expected it to be.

I think it's good sometimes that we can ask questions like this next question I'm going to ask on storage, kind of a follow-up on Brad's question. Storage is down 5% on a constant-currency basis and I would assume that the maintenance renewal rates for storage are actually pretty good. But and when I think of pretty good, I think for enterprise maintenance renewal rates are in the 90s. That's sort of best in class. And so that's why I think you're in for that. But down 5%, even if let's say a 95% renewal rate, that means year-over-year, you didn't sign any license, zero and if it was all maintenance you signed a year ago, that would be down 5%. So either maintenance renewals are actually going down in that business, which I'm not sure why that would happen because these are people that have installed or Symantec storage, or license is just negligible here. And I don't know, if you can just help shedding a lot more light of this. Because as a leader in storage software, both in storage backup and in storage management, even if existing customers are just buying new capacity as they grow, I would think that that should grow a little bit.

The other thing that's important to note here, that we shouldn't overlook -- we've been doing a lot of work on the HP platform and that is a reseller OEM agreement that's coming directly through HP. And so we saw a little bit of slowdown in those billings. And so the growth opportunity for us in storage management is really in 2 areas. One, around virtualization, as people start using technologies like application HA to make their VMs higher availability. And then the second is the continued move and adoption of Linux, specifically Red Hat. And so you're seeing a headwind in that business on some of the more traditional platforms and some opportunities around the new platforms of virtualization and Linux."

Obviously, you've got products in that business unit like DLP and encryption. So those are more of the traditional type of license type sales and those, as we've discussed for several quarters now, have been coming along nicely. So they tended to support margins in that business unit. You will also see the impact of our authentication business. So the larger part of authentication is the server authentication at the sale business. And so the Security and Compliance business unit is continuing to benefit from the acquisition effects, and so that has been supporting margins in SMC as well. Now, going in the other direction, you have much of our hosted services offerings within that business unit. We think that they'll continue to expand. And those come at a lower margin. So it will again, somewhat akin to my earlier answer, will be a balance of both types of factors that will drive to the eventual margin results."

He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter and the fiscal year. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as a review of our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. 
Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the March quarter 2012, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.31 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.30 per euro. For the March 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.41 per euro. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on our website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangible and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I would like introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."
35000,172345754,295693,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings,",1113,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings, however, exceeded our internal plans and the underlying billings activity came in line with our expectations. This resulted in greater billings going to the balance sheet, driving stronger-than-expected deferred revenue. Despite the March quarter results, fiscal year 2012 was a record year for Symantec. We executed on our strategy to strengthen our core businesses, while continuing to grow our emerging businesses. We laid the foundation to capitalize on key growth initiatives in Cloud, Mobile and Virtualization. We developed a number of important innovative technologies that support our strategy. We expanded our portfolio of SaaS-delivered solutions and recently launched 03, our new security service for the cloud. We also introduced multiple mobile application and device management solutions and DLP for tablets. Furthermore, we strengthened our partnership with VMware to provide storage solutions that facilitate virtualization of critical applications. 
In our core businesses, we launched the best performing Enterprise Endpoint Protection product according to industry analysts. We successfully released our Backup Appliances with better-than-expected results and launched the industry's first membership offering for consumer security. We are continuing to make progress in penetrating the SMB segment, where there's more opportunity to grow. We successfully reversed the downward trend in our core Enterprise Endpoint Security business, which saw its third consecutive quarter of bookings growth, driven by SEP 12's award-winning product launch. 
Our Trust Services business also performed well. This is a market many believed to be in decline when we bought it, yet the team's focused execution has driven growth and share gains across both the premium and value segments of the certificate market. 
Our emerging businesses contributed to bookings growth during the fiscal year 2012. User Authentication, designed to protect identities, had another record quarter. Managed Security Services continued to gain share as customers relied on our security expertise to help them deal with the targeted threat environment. We simplified our pricing structure, which has both streamlined the buying process for our customers and improved our margins through better alignment of cost and value. We signed a number of new MSS contracts across geographies, highlighted by an important win at a major German bank. Our SaaS security services also grew as cloud delivery is increasingly the preferred solution for mail and web security. 
As all of these growth drivers are subscription offerings, sales go to the balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue in the coming quarters. In the fourth quarter, we laid the foundation for both our Cloud and Mobile solutions. In order to help customers with the key trend of ""Bring Your Own Device,"" we acquired 2 mobile companies to round out our capabilities. Being able to offer customers mobile device and application management allows employees to use their personal devices in the workplace without having to compromise security or the native user experience. We also launched Phase 1 of 03, our Identity and Access Control service, enabling single sign-on for third-party cloud applications. We have received positive early responses to this service from a variety of customers. 
With storage costs making up 17% of IT budget according to Forrester, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to manage their data in more efficient ways. Symantec enables customers to use virtualization technologies and the cloud to lower IT costs and confidently back up, recover, archive and discover information. Our Information Management products protect and archive physical and virtual machines, using integrated market-leading capabilities. During the year, we strengthened our partnership with VMware. We developed innovative technologies, such as V-Ray, and provided advanced capability for source and target deduplication. In addition, we successfully delivered industry-leading Backup Appliances, which have driven incremental new business and have displaced established competitors. 
In the fourth quarter, we refreshed our Backup products for the Enterprise and SMB segments. We differentiated ourselves by providing up to 100X faster backup speed and integrating with NetApp Snapshots. We leveraged our unique technologies across multiple delivery models, including cloud, fully integrated appliances and traditional on-premise software. We will continue driving the penetration of our appliances into new and developed markets, integrating our complementary eDiscovery and archiving capabilities and cross-selling these higher-growth businesses into our installed base. 
Our Storage Management business received several large renewals from top Telco and financial sector customers, reiterating our customers' commitment to these products and the value of these relationships. Our largest Storage Management customers use both our Backup and Storage Management products to better protect and manage their information. We will continue to expand our partnerships with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate business-critical workloads into their private clouds. The increasing momentum towards the Linux platform and data center modernization will continue to be the primary opportunity drivers going forward. This business generates an important source of cash and profits for the company. 
Our consumer business generated the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We maintained our consumer security leadership during the global decline in PC shipments that was felt most acutely in the developed markets, where the attach rates are much higher than in the emerging markets. In our beyond-the-PC offerings, our cloud backup solution and NortonLive Services continue to generate strong growth. Norton Online Backup now has 14 million users. This solution is an important part of our consumer protection portfolio and has proven to be an important driver of our renewals. Our smartphone and tablet solution, Norton Mobile Security, is also available as an app in the Android market and has received a 4.3 star rating. Today's consumer accesses information on a broader array of devices than the PC. Our recently launched Norton One service enables this trend by ensuring information protection moves with the consumer. Norton One, the industry's first membership offering, represents a new paradigm in consumer information protection. This premium service provides comprehensive protection across multiple devices, back to the personalized experience and dedicated support, all managed through a single cloud-based interface. 
In conclusion, while I'm disappointed with the lower-than-expected revenue results in the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the 9% revenue growth we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We will continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses and growing our emerging opportunities. We are excited about the roadmap for fiscal year 2013 and have many of the foundational elements in place to grow our business. This is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."

As we discussed on our preliminary update call last week, our bookings activity missed our expectations for the fourth quarter, with a year-over-year decline of 26% in license sales and a larger percentage of ratable subscription sales, cost revenue and EPS to come in below our expectations. The higher subscription sales caused more of our billings activity to be recorded on the balance sheet, resulting in a higher deferred revenue balance. For fiscal year 2012, we reported record results for each of our key financial metrics and across all of our geographies. This performance was driven by strength in our Backup, SaaS, DLP and Managed Security Service offerings, as well as the results of our recently acquired businesses. 
First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011. As-reported revenue grew 9% and reached a record $6.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 6%. Acquisitions accounted for $54 million in revenue, resulting in 1% organic constant currency growth for fiscal 2012. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 7%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 3%. Subscription revenue grew 15% and accounted for 43% of total revenue compared to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Enterprise subscriptions grew 40% and accounted for 12% of total revenue as compared to 9% of revenue in the prior year. International revenue grew 7% to $3.49 billion and represented 52% of total revenue. The Americas grew 7%; Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 14%; and the Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 1%. As a result of our billings performance, we exited the year with a record $3.97 billion in deferred revenue, up 5%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% was down 20 basis points and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $1.61. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% from fiscal 2011 on an as-reported basis. Capital expenditures totaled $286 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.615 billion for the fiscal year. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance totaled $3.2 billion, with approximately 28% of this amount residing onshore. During the year, we spent $893 million to  repurchase 51 million shares at an average share price of $17.62, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 6.5% or a net 4.3%, after adjusting for the issuance of employee stock compensation. 
Now I'll review the financial details of the March 2012 quarter compared to the March 2011 period. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year and totaled $1.681 billion. Clearwell generated revenue of $13 million, below what we were expecting due to increased competitive pricing in the eDiscovery litigation service provider channel. LiveOffice generated $4 million in revenue, coming in better than planned. For the fourth quarter, our organic constant currency revenue declined 2% year-over-year. As we mentioned last week, license revenue declined 26% year-over-year, in part as a result of record license sales in the year-ago period and the continuing shift towards subscription-based products and services. Content and maintenance revenue continued to grow steadily, increasing 4% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 10% and accounted for 41% of total revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscription sales grew 30% year-over-year. Across the Enterprise business, we closed a total of 487 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, approximately equal to the number in the year-ago period, and 128 of these transactions generated more than $1 million of bookings, up 7% year-over-year. The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year, driven by strength in MSS, SaaS and Authentication Services. Our Endpoint Security business also grew for the third consecutive quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment decreased 5% as compared to the March 2011 quarter, driven by weakness in our Storage Management business and a pause in sales before the launch of our new Backup Exec product. Revenue from our backup, archiving and eDiscovery business was down 3% year-over-year, but our newly launched Appliance business continued to exceed expectations, more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business decreased 8% year-over-year, driven by lower license sales than in the year-ago period. The consumer business was up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our new cloud and service offerings, as well as improving renewal rates in the core business. The new service offerings grew 54% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth. OEM placement fees were greater than our forecast by $5.4 million, as our OEM partners shipped more units than they had originally forecasted. For the June quarter, we expect PC shipments to increase as our OEM partners ship more units into emerging countries, which have lower software attach rates. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $64 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 17% as compared to 7% in the March 2011 quarter. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6% for the March 2012 quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year on increasing appliance and SaaS sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2%, down 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by weaker-than-expected revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%, below our guidance of 27%, due to several onetime items being resolved favorably during the quarter. 
We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $687 million. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $17.88. 
We are reaffirming the guidance we provided last week. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro, a decrease of 8% versus the weighted average rate of $1.44 and the end-of-period rate of $1.45 per euro from the June 2011 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 725 million shares. Thus, for the June 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.66 billion as compared to revenue of $1.653 billion during the June 2011 quarter. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to be up 2.4% to 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. We expect Clearwell and LiveOffice to generate combined revenue between $11 million and $15 million in the June period. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.18 and $0.19, as compared to $0.25 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.37 and $0.38, as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period, down 1.5% to up 1% after adjusting for currency. GAAP-deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.715 billion and $3.735 billion, compared to $3.689 billion at the end of June 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up between 2.8% and 3.4% in constant currency. 74% or $1.23 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. This is the highest deferred revenue rolloff percentage we've seen to date. 
In conclusion, although our recognized revenue was weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong bookings performance generated in fiscal year 2012. We remain focused on consistent execution and managing our expenses judiciously to drive top line organic growth in the coming fiscal year. And now I'll turn it back to Helyn to begin polling for your questions."

So as the quarters go by, I would expect that to normalize more in-line with the true organic blended rate of the SSL business with the higher organic growth rates of the other of our subscription services businesses. So I would expect it to come down somewhat over time. In terms of the margin around the Storage Management side of the business, I would certainly expect the Backup performance to be improving in coming quarters. We talked in our remarks about something of a pause around Backup Exec products that were released of a bad new offering. We also have a new version of NetBackup into the marketplace. And so as those license-oriented sales rise, I would expect margins to rise as well versus what we recorded in the March quarter."

And as we book longer-term deals, so, for example, our cloud-based services, we look at total contract value or a commitment over 3-year period. So for example, we give credit for somebody who closes a 3-year .cloud deal, and that's 3 years worth of credit. And so it's important to note that some of the bookings are not going to show up in revenue and deferred revenue. They're actually going to show up in years 2 and 3. That's also the case for MSS and a couple of our other businesses. So it's -- the total activity, because what we're trying to do is get customers to commit to longer subscriptions with us, and that's been our practice over the years, Brad."

But -- and when I think of pretty good, I think for Enterprise maintenance renewal rates are in the 90s. That's sort of best in class, and that's why I think you're in for that. But down 5%, that, even if -- let's say a 95% renewal rate, that means year-over-year, you didn't sign any license, 0, and if it was all maintenance that you signed a year ago, that would be down 5%. So either maintenance renewals are actually going down in that business, which I'm not sure why that would happen because these are people that have installed Veritas or Symantec Storage, or license is just negligible here. And I don't know, if you can help shine a little more light on this, because as a leader in Storage software, both in storage backup and in Storage Management, even if existing customers are just buying new capacity as they grow, I would think that, that should grow a little bit. And I just -- in the market itself, appears to be growing a little. Just kind of shocking to see those numbers. If you can sort of address that."

When you look at the overall Storage Management business, that is where we've seen the decline that is driving the shortfall that you're describing. And specifically, that segment is down 8% in what we call the Storage Management area, not the Backup and recovery part of SSMG. The other thing that's important to note here, that we shouldn't overlook -- we've been doing a lot of work on the HP-UX platform, and that is a reseller OEM agreement that is coming directly through HP, and so we saw a little bit of slowdown in those billings. And so the growth opportunity for us in Storage Management is really in 2 areas: one, around virtualization, as people start using technologies like Application HA to make their VMs higher availability; and then the second is the continued move and adoption of Linux, specifically, Red Hat. And so you're seeing a headwind in that business on some of the more traditional platforms and some opportunities around the new platforms of virtualization and Linux."

And so the outlook on the consumer business, my expectation is, that business will continue to grow year-over-year by, I think, at a slightly reduced rate as we continue to see this shift in where PCs are going. Now the opportunity for us is, as Janice and her team have shipped products like Norton One, which allow us to create a capability that goes across devices.

While there is some overlap in our traditional mail and messaging Security products, where customers are looking at the .cloud capability versus the on-premise, when I look at a lot of the new growth opportunities, MSS, Trust Services, even our ev.cloud, where customers do have on-premise capability, ev.cloud is tending to go into new customers, not into the existing base of people moving from on-premise Enterprise vault to a cloud-based Enterprise vault.

A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. 
Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the March quarter 2012, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.31 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.30 per euro. For the March 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.41 per euro. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on our website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangible and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I would like introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings,",1114,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings, however, exceeded our internal plans and the underlying billings activity came in line with our expectations. This resulted in greater billings going to the balance sheet, driving stronger-than-expected deferred revenue. Despite the March quarter results, fiscal year 2012 was a record year for Symantec. We executed on our strategy to strengthen our core businesses, while continuing to grow our emerging businesses. We laid the foundation to capitalize on key growth initiatives in Cloud, Mobile and Virtualization. We developed a number of important innovative technologies that support our strategy. We expanded our portfolio of SaaS-delivered solutions and recently launched 03, our new security service for the cloud. We also introduced multiple mobile application and device management solutions and DLP for tablets. Furthermore, we strengthened our partnership with VMware to provide storage solutions that facilitate virtualization of critical applications. 
In our core businesses, we launched the best performing Enterprise Endpoint Protection product according to industry analysts. We successfully released our Backup Appliances with better-than-expected results and launched the industry's first membership offering for consumer security. We are continuing to make progress in penetrating the SMB segment, where there's more opportunity to grow. We successfully reversed the downward trend in our core Enterprise Endpoint Security business, which saw its third consecutive quarter of bookings growth, driven by SEP 12's award-winning product launch. 
Our Trust Services business also performed well. This is a market many believed to be in decline when we bought it, yet the team's focused execution has driven growth and share gains across both the premium and value segments of the certificate market. 
Our emerging businesses contributed to bookings growth during the fiscal year 2012. User Authentication, designed to protect identities, had another record quarter. Managed Security Services continued to gain share as customers relied on our security expertise to help them deal with the targeted threat environment. We simplified our pricing structure, which has both streamlined the buying process for our customers and improved our margins through better alignment of cost and value. We signed a number of new MSS contracts across geographies, highlighted by an important win at a major German bank. Our SaaS security services also grew as cloud delivery is increasingly the preferred solution for mail and web security. 
As all of these growth drivers are subscription offerings, sales go to the balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue in the coming quarters. In the fourth quarter, we laid the foundation for both our Cloud and Mobile solutions. In order to help customers with the key trend of ""Bring Your Own Device,"" we acquired 2 mobile companies to round out our capabilities. Being able to offer customers mobile device and application management allows employees to use their personal devices in the workplace without having to compromise security or the native user experience. We also launched Phase I of 03, our Identity and Access Control service, enabling single sign-on for third-party cloud applications. We have received positive early responses to this service from a variety of customers. 
With storage costs making up 17% of IT budget according to Forrester, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to manage their data in more efficient ways. Symantec enables customers to use virtualization technologies and the cloud to lower IT costs and confidently back up, recover, archive and discover information. Our Information Management products protect and archive physical and virtual machines, using integrated market-leading capabilities. During the year, we strengthened our partnership with VMware. We developed innovative technologies, such as V-Ray, and provided advanced capability for source and for target deduplication. In addition, we successfully delivered industry-leading Backup Appliances, which have driven incremental new business and have displaced established competitors. 
In the fourth quarter, we refreshed our Backup products for the Enterprise and SMB segments. We differentiated ourselves by providing up to 100X faster backup speed and integrating with NetApp Snapshots. We leveraged our unique technologies across multiple delivery models, including cloud, fully integrated appliances and traditional on-premise software. We will continue driving the penetration of our appliances into new and developed markets, integrating our complementary eDiscovery and archiving capabilities and cross-selling these higher-growth businesses into our installed base. 
Our Storage Management business received several large renewals from top Telco and financial sector customers, reiterating our customers' commitment to these products and the value of these relationships. Our large Storage Management customers use both our Backup and Storage Management products to better protect and manage their information. We will continue to expand our partnerships with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate business-critical workloads into their private clouds. The increasing momentum towards the Linux platform and data center modernization will continue to be the primary opportunity drivers going forward. This business generates an important source of cash and profits for the company. 
Our consumer business generated its 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We maintained our consumer security leadership during the global decline in PC shipments that was felt most acutely in the developed markets, where the attach rates are much higher than in the emerging markets. In our beyond-the-PC offerings, our cloud backup solution and NortonLive Services continue to generate strong growth. Norton Online Backup now has 14 million users. This solution is an important part of our consumer protection portfolio and has proven to be an important driver of our renewals. Our smartphone and tablet solution, Norton Mobile Security, is also available as an app in the Android market and has received a 4.3 star rating. Today's consumer accesses information on a broader array of devices than the PC. Our recently launched Norton One service enables this trend by ensuring information protection moves with the consumer. Norton One, the industry's first membership offering, represents a new paradigm in consumer information protection. This premium service provides comprehensive protection across multiple devices, backed with a personalized experience and dedicated support, all managed through a single cloud-based interface. 
In conclusion, while I'm disappointed with the lower-than-expected revenue results in the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the 9% revenue growth we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We will continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses and growing our emerging opportunities. We are excited about the roadmap for fiscal year 2013 and have many of the foundational elements in place to grow our business. This is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."

As we discussed on our preliminary update call last week, our bookings activity met our expectations for the fourth quarter, but a year-over-year decline of 26% in license sales and a larger percentage of ratable subscription sales, caused revenue and EPS to come in below our expectations. The higher subscription sales caused more of our billings activity to be recorded on the balance sheet, resulting in a higher deferred revenue balance. For fiscal year 2012, we reported record results for each of our key financial metrics and across all of our geographies. This performance was driven by strength in our Backup, SaaS, DLP and Managed Security Service offerings, as well as the results of our recently acquired businesses. 
First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011. As-reported revenue grew 9% and reached a record $6.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 6%. Acquisitions accounted for $54 million in revenue, resulting in 1% organic constant currency growth for fiscal 2012. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 7%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 3%. Subscription revenue grew 15% and accounted for 43% of total revenue compared to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Enterprise subscriptions grew 40% and accounted for 12% of total revenue as compared to 9% of revenue in the prior year. International revenue grew 7% to $3.49 billion and represented 52% of total revenue. The Americas grew 7%; Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 14%; and the Europe/Middle East/Africa region grew 1%. As a result of our billings performance, we exited the year with a record $3.97 billion in deferred revenue, up 5%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% was down 20 basis points and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $1.61. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% from fiscal 2011 on an as-reported basis. Capital expenditures totaled $286 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.615 billion for the fiscal year. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance totaled $3.2 billion, with approximately 28% of this amount residing onshore. During the year, we spent $893 million to repurchase 51 million shares at an average share price of $17.62, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 6.5% or a net 4.3%, after adjusting for the issuance of employee stock compensation. 
Now I'll review the financial details of the March 2012 quarter compared to the March 2011 period. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year and totaled $1.681 billion. Clearwell generated revenue of $13 million, below what we were expecting due to increased competitive pricing in the eDiscovery litigation service provider channel. LiveOffice generated $4 million in revenue, coming in better than planned. For the fourth quarter, our organic constant currency revenue declined 2% year-over-year. As we mentioned last week, license revenue declined 26% year-over-year, in part as a result of record license sales in the year-ago period and the continuing shift towards subscription-based products and services. Content and maintenance revenue continued to grow steadily, increasing 4% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 10% and accounted for 41% of total revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscription sales grew 30% year-over-year. Across the Enterprise business, we closed a total of 487 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, approximately equal to the number in the year-ago period, and 128 of these transactions generated more than $1 million of bookings, up 7% year-over-year. The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year, driven by strength in MSS, SaaS and Authentication Services. Our Endpoint Security business also grew for the third consecutive quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment decreased 5% as compared to the March 2011 quarter, driven by weakness in our Storage Management business and a pause in sales before the launch of our new Backup Exec product. Revenue from our backup, archiving and eDiscovery business was down 3% year-over-year, but our newly launched Appliance business continues to exceed expectations, more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business decreased 8% year-over-year, driven by lower license sales than in the year-ago period. The consumer business was up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our new cloud and service offerings, as well as improving renewal rates in the core business. The new service offerings grew 54% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth. OEM placement fees were greater than our forecast by $5.4 million, as our OEM partners shipped more units than they had originally forecasted. For the June quarter, we expect PC shipments to increase as our OEM partners ship more units into emerging countries, which have lower software attach rates. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $64 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 17% as compared to 7% in the March 2011 quarter. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6% for the March 2012 quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year on increasing appliance and SaaS sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2%, down 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by weaker-than-expected revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%, below our guidance of 27%, due to several onetime items being resolved favorably during the quarter. 
We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $687 million. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $17.88. 
We are reaffirming the guidance we provided last week. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro, a decrease of 8% versus the weighted average rate of $1.44 and the end-of-period rate of $1.45 per euro from the June 2011 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 725 million shares. Thus, for the June 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.66 billion as compared to revenue of $1.653 billion during the June 2011 quarter. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to be up 2.4% to 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. We expect Clearwell and LiveOffice to generate combined revenue between $11 million and $15 million in the June period. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.18 and $0.19, as compared to $0.25 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.37 and $0.38, as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period, down 1.5% to up 1% after adjusting for currency. GAAP-deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.715 billion and $3.735 billion, compared to $3.689 billion at the end of June 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up between 2.8% and 3.4% in constant currency. 74% or $1.23 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. This is the highest deferred revenue rolloff percentage we've seen to date. 
In conclusion, although our recognized revenue was weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong bookings performance generated in fiscal year 2012. We remain focused on consistent execution and managing our expenses judiciously to drive top line organic growth in the coming fiscal year. And now I'll turn it back to Helyn to begin polling for your questions."

So as the quarters go by, I would expect that to normalize more in-line with the true organic blended rate of the SSL business with the higher organic growth rates of the other of our subscription services businesses. So I would expect it to come down somewhat over time. In terms of the margin around the Storage Management side of the business, I would certainly expect the Backup performance to be improving in coming quarters. We talked in our remarks about something of a pause around Backup Exec prior to the release of that new offering. We also have a new version of NetBackup into the marketplace. And so as those license-oriented sales rise, I would expect margins to rise as well versus what we recorded in the March quarter."

So for example, we give credit for somebody who closes a 3-year .cloud deal; that's 3 years worth of credit. And so it's important to note that some of the bookings are not going to show up in revenue and deferred revenue. They're actually going to show up in years 2 and 3. That's also the case for MSS and a couple of our other businesses. So it's just the total activity, because what we're trying to do is get customers to commit to longer subscriptions with us, and that's been our practice over the years, Brad."

Now the consumer side of the business has obviously a very different profile in terms of the way the bookings build during the quarter. It's a much more linear approach throughout the quarter.

I think it's good sometimes that we can ask questions like this next one I'm going to ask on storage. It's sort of a follow-up to Brad's question. Storage is down 5% on a constant-currency basis and I would assume that the maintenance renewal rates for Storage are actually pretty good. But -- and when I think of pretty good, I think for Enterprise maintenance renewal rates are in the 90s. That's sort of best in class, and that's why I would think you're in for that. But down 5%, that, even if -- let's say a 95% renewal rate, that means year-over-year, you didn't sign any licenses. Zero. And if it was all maintenance that you signed a year ago, that would be down 5%. So either maintenance renewals are actually going down in that business, which, actually, I'm not sure why that would happen because these are people that have installed Veritas or Symantec Storage, and/or license is just negligible here. And I don't know, if you can help shine a little more light on this. Because as a leader in Storage software, both in storage backup and in Storage Management, even if existing customers are just buying new capacity as they grow, I would think that, that should grow a little bit. And just -- in the market itself, it appears to be growing a little. Just kind of shocking to see those numbers. If you can sort of address that."

The other thing that's important to note here, that we shouldn't overlook -- we've been doing a lot of work on the HP-UX platform, and that is a reseller OEM agreement that is coming directly through HP, and so we saw a little bit of slowdown in those billings. And so the growth opportunity for us in Storage Management is really in 2 areas: one, around virtualization, as people start using technologies like Application HA to make their VMs higher availability; and then the second is the continued move and adoption of Linux, specifically, Red Hat. And so you're seeing a headwind in that business on some of the more traditional platforms and some opportunities around the new platforms of virtualization and Linux."

With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter and the fiscal year. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as a review of our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. 
Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the March quarter 2012, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.31 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.30 per euro. For the March 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.41 per euro. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on our website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangible and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I would like introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem."

As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings,",1114,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings, however, exceeded our internal plans and the underlying billings activity came in line with our expectations. This resulted in greater billings going to the balance sheet, driving stronger-than-expected deferred revenue. Despite the March quarter results, fiscal year 2012 was a record year for Symantec. We executed on our strategy to strengthen our core businesses, while continuing to grow our emerging businesses. We laid the foundation to capitalize on key growth initiatives in Cloud, Mobile and Virtualization. We developed a number of important innovative technologies that support our strategy. We expanded our portfolio of SaaS-delivered solutions and recently launched 03, our new security service for the cloud. We also introduced multiple mobile application and device management solutions and DLP for tablets. Furthermore, we strengthened our partnership with VMware to provide storage solutions that facilitate virtualization of critical applications. 
In our core businesses, we launched the best performing Enterprise Endpoint Protection product according to industry analysts. We successfully released our Backup Appliances with better-than-expected results and launched the industry's first membership offering for consumer security. We are continuing to make progress in penetrating the SMB segment, where there's more opportunity to grow. We successfully reversed the downward trend in our core Enterprise Endpoint Security business, which saw its third consecutive quarter of bookings growth, driven by SEP 12's award-winning product launch. 
Our Trust Services business also performed well. This is a market many believed to be in decline when we bought it, yet the team's focused execution has driven growth and share gains across both the premium and value segments of the certificate market. 
Our emerging businesses contributed to bookings growth during the fiscal year 2012. User Authentication, designed to protect identities, had another record quarter. Managed Security Services continued to gain share as customers relied on our security expertise to help them deal with the targeted threat environment. We simplified our pricing structure, which has both streamlined the buying process for our customers and improved our margins through better alignment of cost and value. We signed a number of new MSS contracts across geographies, highlighted by an important win at a major German bank. Our SaaS security services also grew as cloud delivery is increasingly the preferred solution for mail and web security. 
As all of these growth drivers are subscription offerings, sales go to the balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue in the coming quarters. In the fourth quarter, we laid the foundation for both our Cloud and Mobile solutions. In order to help customers with the key trend of ""Bring Your Own Device,"" we acquired 2 mobile companies to round out our capabilities. Being able to offer customers mobile device and application management allows employees to use their personal devices in the workplace without having to compromise security or the native user experience. We also launched Phase I of 03, our Identity and Access Control service, enabling single sign-on for third-party cloud applications. We have received positive early responses to this service from a variety of customers. 
With storage costs making up 17% of IT budget according to Forrester, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to manage their data in more efficient ways. Symantec enables customers to use virtualization technologies and the cloud to lower IT costs and confidently back up, recover, archive and discover information. Our Information Management products protect and archive physical and virtual machines, using integrated market-leading capabilities. During the year, we strengthened our partnership with VMware. We developed innovative technologies, such as V-Ray, and provided advanced capability for source and for target deduplication. In addition, we successfully delivered industry-leading Backup Appliances, which have driven incremental new business and have displaced established competitors. 
In the fourth quarter, we refreshed our Backup products for the Enterprise and SMB segments. We differentiated ourselves by providing up to 100X faster backup speed and integrating with NetApp Snapshots. We leveraged our unique technologies across multiple delivery models, including cloud, fully integrated appliances and traditional on-premise software. We will continue driving the penetration of our appliances into new and developed markets, integrating our complementary eDiscovery and archiving capabilities and cross-selling these higher-growth businesses into our installed base. 
Our Storage Management business received several large renewals from top Telco and financial sector customers, reiterating our customers' commitment to these products and the value of these relationships. Our large Storage Management customers use both our Backup and Storage Management products to better protect and manage their information. We will continue to expand our partnerships with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate business-critical workloads into their private clouds. The increasing momentum towards the Linux platform and data center modernization will continue to be the primary opportunity drivers going forward. This business generates an important source of cash and profits for the company. 
Our consumer business generated its 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We maintained our consumer security leadership during the global decline in PC shipments that was felt most acutely in the developed markets, where the attach rates are much higher than in the emerging markets. In our beyond-the-PC offerings, our cloud backup solution and NortonLive Services continue to generate strong growth. Norton Online Backup now has 14 million users. This solution is an important part of our consumer protection portfolio and has proven to be an important driver of our renewals. Our smartphone and tablet solution, Norton Mobile Security, is also available as an app in the Android market and has received a 4.3 star rating. Today's consumer accesses information on a broader array of devices than the PC. Our recently launched Norton One service enables this trend by ensuring information protection moves with the consumer. Norton One, the industry's first membership offering, represents a new paradigm in consumer information protection. This premium service provides comprehensive protection across multiple devices, backed with a personalized experience and dedicated support, all managed through a single cloud-based interface. 
In conclusion, while I'm disappointed with the lower-than-expected revenue results in the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the 9% revenue growth we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We will continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses and growing our emerging opportunities. We are excited about the roadmap for fiscal year 2013 and have many of the foundational elements in place to grow our business. This is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results."

As we discussed on our preliminary update call last week, our bookings activity met our expectations for the fourth quarter, but a year-over-year decline of 26% in license sales and a larger percentage of ratable subscription sales, caused revenue and EPS to come in below our expectations. The higher subscription sales caused more of our billings activity to be recorded on the balance sheet, resulting in a higher deferred revenue balance. For fiscal year 2012, we reported record results for each of our key financial metrics and across all of our geographies. This performance was driven by strength in our Backup, SaaS, DLP and Managed Security Service offerings, as well as the results of our recently acquired businesses. 
First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011. As-reported revenue grew 9% and reached a record $6.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 6%. Acquisitions accounted for $54 million in revenue, resulting in 1% organic constant currency growth for fiscal 2012. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 7%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 3%. Subscription revenue grew 15% and accounted for 43% of total revenue compared to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Enterprise subscriptions grew 40% and accounted for 12% of total revenue as compared to 9% of revenue in the prior year. International revenue grew 7% to $3.49 billion and represented 52% of total revenue. The Americas grew 7%; Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 14%; and the Europe/Middle East/Africa region grew 1%. As a result of our billings performance, we exited the year with a record $3.97 billion in deferred revenue, up 5%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% was down 20 basis points and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $1.61. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% from fiscal 2011 on an as-reported basis. Capital expenditures totaled $286 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.615 billion for the fiscal year. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance totaled $3.2 billion, with approximately 28% of this amount residing onshore. During the year, we spent $893 million to repurchase 51 million shares at an average share price of $17.62, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 6.5% or a net 4.3%, after adjusting for the issuance of employee stock compensation. 
Now I'll review the financial details of the March 2012 quarter compared to the March 2011 period. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year and totaled $1.681 billion. Clearwell generated revenue of $13 million, below what we were expecting due to increased competitive pricing in the eDiscovery litigation service provider channel. LiveOffice generated $4 million in revenue, coming in better than planned. For the fourth quarter, our organic constant currency revenue declined 2% year-over-year. As we mentioned last week, license revenue declined 26% year-over-year, in part as a result of record license sales in the year-ago period and the continuing shift towards subscription-based products and services. Content and maintenance revenue continued to grow steadily, increasing 4% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 10% and accounted for 41% of total revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscription sales grew 30% year-over-year. Across the Enterprise business, we closed a total of 487 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, approximately equal to the number in the year-ago period, and 128 of these transactions generated more than $1 million of bookings, up 7% year-over-year. The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year, driven by strength in MSS, SaaS and Authentication Services. Our Endpoint Security business also grew for the third consecutive quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment decreased 5% as compared to the March 2011 quarter, driven by weakness in our Storage Management business and a pause in sales before the launch of our new Backup Exec product. Revenue from our backup, archiving and eDiscovery business was down 3% year-over-year, but our newly launched Appliance business continues to exceed expectations, more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. 
Revenue from our Storage Management business decreased 8% year-over-year, driven by lower license sales than in the year-ago period. The consumer business was up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our new cloud and service offerings, as well as improving renewal rates in the core business. The new service offerings grew 54% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth. OEM placement fees were greater than our forecast by $5.4 million, as our OEM partners shipped more units than they had originally forecasted. For the June quarter, we expect PC shipments to increase as our OEM partners ship more units into emerging countries, which have lower software attach rates. 
Our Services business generated revenue of $64 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 17% as compared to 7% in the March 2011 quarter. 
Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6% for the March 2012 quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year on increasing appliance and SaaS sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2%, down 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by weaker-than-expected revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%, below our guidance of 27%, due to several onetime items being resolved favorably during the quarter. 
We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $687 million. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $17.88. 
We are reaffirming the guidance we provided last week. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro, a decrease of 8% versus the weighted average rate of $1.44 and the end-of-period rate of $1.45 per euro from the June 2011 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 725 million shares. Thus, for the June 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.66 billion as compared to revenue of $1.653 billion during the June 2011 quarter. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to be up 2.4% to 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. We expect Clearwell and LiveOffice to generate combined revenue between $11 million and $15 million in the June period. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.18 and $0.19, as compared to $0.25 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.37 and $0.38, as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period, down 1.5% to up 1% after adjusting for currency. GAAP-deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.715 billion and $3.735 billion, compared to $3.689 billion at the end of June 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up between 2.8% and 3.4% in constant currency. 74% or $1.23 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. This is the highest deferred revenue rolloff percentage we've seen to date. 
In conclusion, although our recognized revenue was weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong bookings performance generated in fiscal year 2012. We remain focused on consistent execution and managing our expenses judiciously to drive top line organic growth in the coming fiscal year. And now I'll turn it back to Helyn to begin polling for your questions."

So as the quarters go by, I would expect that to normalize more in-line with the true organic blended rate of the SSL business with the higher organic growth rates of the other of our subscription services businesses. So I would expect it to come down somewhat over time. In terms of the margin around the Storage Management side of the business, I would certainly expect the Backup performance to be improving in coming quarters. We talked in our remarks about something of a pause around Backup Exec prior to the release of that new offering. We also have a new version of NetBackup into the marketplace. And so as those license-oriented sales rise, I would expect margins to rise as well versus what we recorded in the March quarter."

And as we book longer-term deals, so, for example, our cloud-based services, we look at the total contract value, a commitment over a 3-year period. So for example, we give credit for somebody who closes a 3-year .cloud deal; that's 3 years worth of credit. And so it's important to note that some of the bookings are not going to show up in revenue and deferred revenue. They're actually going to show up in years 2 and 3. That's also the case for MSS and a couple of our other businesses. So it's just the total activity, because what we're trying to do is get customers to commit to longer subscriptions with us, and that's been our practice over the years, Brad."

Now the consumer side of the business has obviously a very different profile in terms of the way the bookings build during the quarter. It's a much more linear approach throughout the quarter.

But down 5%, that, even if -- let's say a 95% renewal rate, that means year-over-year, you didn't sign any licenses. Zero. And if it was all maintenance that you signed a year ago, that would be down 5%. So either maintenance renewals are actually going down in that business, which, actually, I'm not sure why that would happen because these are people that have installed Veritas or Symantec Storage, and/or license is just negligible here. And I don't know, if you can help shine a little more light on this. Because as a leader in Storage software, both in storage backup and in Storage Management, even if existing customers are just buying new capacity as they grow, I would think that, that should grow a little bit. And just -- in the market itself, it appears to be growing a little. Just kind of shocking to see those numbers. If you can sort of address that."

When you look at the overall Storage Management business, that is where we've seen the decline that is driving the shortfall that you're describing. And specifically, that segment is down 8% in what we call the Storage Management area, not the Backup and recovery part of SSMG. The other thing that's important to note here, that we shouldn't overlook -- we've been doing a lot of work on the HP-UX platform, and that is a reseller OEM agreement that is coming directly through HP, and so we saw a little bit of slowdown in those billings. And so the growth opportunity for us in Storage Management is really in 2 areas: one, around virtualization, as people start using technologies like Application HA to make their VMs higher availability; and then the second is the continued move and adoption of Linux, specifically, Red Hat. And so you're seeing a headwind in that business on some of the more traditional platforms and some opportunities around the new platforms of virtualization and Linux."

And what we definitely are seeing, as you know, in our business, especially when we talk about the OEM deals, a lot of the units that we're shipping are going into the emerging markets that have a lower attach rate. Now we are seeing a bit of a pickup in total PC unit shipments, but that has continued to go into emerging markets. And so the outlook on the consumer business, my expectation is, that business will continue to grow year-over-year, but, I think, at a slightly reduced rate as we continue to see this shift in where PCs are going. Now the opportunity for us is, as Janice and her team have shipped products like Norton One, which allow us to create a capability that goes across devices -- as that product goes into the market, my expectation is that we'll start to see a improvement in the bookings for the consumer business. And so my expectation is that, that business will definitely grow year-over-year, but probably lower than we've seen in the previous periods."

While there is some overlap in our traditional mail and messaging Security products, where customers are looking at the .cloud capability versus the on-premise, when I look at a lot of new growth opportunities, MSS, Trust Services, even our ev.cloud, where customers do have on-premise capability, ev.cloud is tending to go into new customers, not into the existing base of people moving from on-premise Enterprise vault to a cloud-based Enterprise vault.

He will make a few opening remarks, then James will provide quarterly highlights and review our financial results, as well as guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. 
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis only. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the June 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.28 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.27 per euro, compared to the guided rate of $1.32. For the June '11 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.45. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on the website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

We apologize for the last-minute change but because of the announcement, we thought that was the right thing to do to make this change on short notice. So I'm really glad to be here on our earnings call and my first day on my new job. 
The decision to replace Enrique was a tough one. It was not based on any particular event or issue but one that the board made after reflection on the ongoing company performance. While progress has been made over the last 3 years in many areas, it was the board's decision that making a change now was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. Enrique has been a significant contributor during his 19 years at Symantec. Throughout his time and especially during his last 3 years as CEO, Enrique showed an incredible dedication to customers and strong enthusiasm to pursue new emerging opportunities. I want to recognize and thank him for his considerable commitment and wish him the best in the future. 
My perspective is that while the company has very strong assets, we are underperforming against the opportunities and I'm very excited about working with our leaders to speed up the pace at which we create value for all of our stakeholders. My first order of business will be to speak with our customers, partners and shareholders, and over the next 90 to 120 days I'm going on a tour to listen, learn and work with the leadership team to figure out the right strategy to leverage all of Symantec resources to accelerate our rate of value creation. Once this tour is completed, I'll share our go-forward strategy to win in the marketplace and how we're going to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth. This is a process I've used before many times in the past. It's been successful and I look forward to applying the similar playbook at Symantec. With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review the quarterly highlights and financial details."

Let me start by welcoming you, Steve, to the management team and I look forward to working closely with you to drive value creation at Symantec. Now, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our consumer results were driven by ongoing cross-selling and up-selling. The consumer security products continue to demonstrate best-in-class quality, winning over 250 awards in the past 2 years. Though early in their product lifecycle, our newest premium suites, Norton One and Norton 360 Everywhere have received very positive feedback, with Norton One earning the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine. We also refreshed and extended our portfolio to target the growing number of Mac users. 
Norton Online Backup and NortonLive solutions maintained their strong performance and continued to be meaningful contributors to the growth of our business. Our Norton Mobile Security solution maintained its leadership position in the mobile security market as we surpassed Lookout as the top-grossing security app in the Google Play marketplace. While still a nascent market, our products continue to receive top reviews, with Norton Mobile Security earning 4.4 stars in Google Play. We also signed new Norton Mobile Security partnerships with several leading wireless retailers and carriers in all 3 regions. 
On the enterprise side, our backup, archiving and E-Discovery solutions continue to drive momentum. Our enterprise backup business continues to be driven by customers' desire to minimize complexity and backup challenges without complicating recovery. With 3 Best of VMWorld awards, Symantec is the industry leader in VMware and Hyper-V backup. Only Symantec offers a single product capable of providing true individual file recovery, deduplication and policy management across the VMWare, Hyper-V and traditional physical servers. 
Let me spend a moment on an area where we didn't execute to our high standards on a new product launch. While we delivered a much improved user interface for Backup Exec, we excluded specific functionality that customers still required. As such, we have now reinstated this functionality to further simplify the backup process. We expect it will take 2 to 3 quarters to get Backup Exec back on track. 
Our backup appliance business is gaining significant traction and has been well received by customers and the industry alike. Our 5220 appliance won the Backup and Recovery Award at Microsoft's Best of TechEd 2012 event. In the June quarter, we delivered our first appliance for the midmarket and we continue to grow our Appliance business by expanding our portfolio into additional geographies. 
The quality of our Endpoint Protection product, SEP 12, continues to garner industry acclaim. Third-party research has confirmed that SEP 12 uses less computing power to provide greater protection than competitive offerings. In addition, at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, the quality of SEP was identified as a primary threat to our competitors. 
Trust Services, our SSL certificate business, had another strong quarter. We continue to differentiate our premium and value SSL brands, driving growth in both market segments. We've also simplified and streamlined our online enrollment process, which will be rolled out to other geographies throughout the year. 
Our Data Loss Prevention solutions saw strong growth across all of our geographies, including an increased appetite for DLP in Europe. We are winning competitive bids by demonstrating our market-leading capability to protect sensitive information from the desktop to the server. We rolled out DLP for tablets in fiscal 2012 to accommodate the breadth of devices in use and plan to extend support to the iPhone later this year. 
eDiscovery and cloud-based archiving exceeded our expectations this quarter, as we leveraged the scope and scale of the Symantec sales force. Both products were named leaders in their respective Gartner Magic Quadrants as customers reported that our solutions were easy to buy, implement and use. 
User Authentication continued its strong growth in the first quarter. We continue to gain market share as customers chose our Software-as-a-Service-based authentication solution for its ease-of-use and best-in-class security. As governments and businesses more online services requiring security, we expect to see continued growth for these services. 
Leveraging our User Authentication technology, our security for the cloud solution, O3, signed its first large enterprise customer and continues to garner significant attention. Enterprises are rapidly shifting their software needs to the cloud and the security and visibility O3 offers addresses a critical customer need. 
We made significant progress towards developing the first complete enterprise mobility solution, including device and application management, data protection and full compliance capabilities. While we work towards integrating these best-of-breed capabilities, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers. 
Moving now to the financial details, we posted better-than-expected first quarter results to each of our key financial metrics for which we guide: revenue, deferred revenue and EPS. 
GAAP revenue totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 4% versus the June 2011 period. Our Clearwell and LiveOffice acquisitions together, accounted for $24 million of total revenue. Our organic constant currency revenue growth rate for the June quarter was 1% year-over-year. Despite the U.S. dollar strengthening by approximately 11% against the euro, year-over-year, our results were better than expected. Total foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by 3 percentage points, driving our reported revenue growth rate of 1%. 
Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 6%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 2%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and Software-as-a-Service offerings, grew 10% and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 42% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year-ago period. 
The Consumer business generated revenue of $521 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by upselling customers to our premium suites and growing our emerging businesses, such as Online Backup, NortonLive Services and our mobile applications. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $584 million, an increase of 1% as compared to the June 2011 quarter driven by continued growth in our backup and archiving business. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 6% year-over-year, driven by our appliances, cloud-based archiving and eDiscovery solutions. Revenue from the storage and availability management business declined 8% year-over-year. This business continues to be highly profitable and generates strong cash flow for the company. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $501 million, up 10% year-over-year as our Endpoint Protection business continues to gain market share with enterprise customers. Our authentication services and Data Loss Prevention solutions continued to post double-digit growth. 
This is the first quarter of year-over-year growth for our Services business since we transitioned our consulting services to specialized partners. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 140 basis points to 84.3%, as higher costs are associated with these businesses, a trend we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1%, down 60 basis points compared to the June 2011 quarter. Operating margins were better than we expected in the June quarter due to lower-than-expected OEM fees, which accounted for approximately $0.01 of benefit to EPS. In addition, ongoing cost controls decreased expenses as we continue to tightly manage our expense structure. 
Improved operating leverage from better-than-expected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. Net income of $309 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Continued growth in subscriptions and maintenance contributed to deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.75 billion. 
We exited the June quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which was an increase of 79% year-over-year, driven primarily by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14 and the sale of our 49% stake in the Huawei-Symantec joint venture. As we exited the June quarter, approximately 47% of our cash balance resided in the U.S., which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from our June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 30% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. 
We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $301 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 19 million shares at an average price of $15.59. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted operating cash flow by $12 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $340 million. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2012 quarter. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, we expect GAAP revenue for the September 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.635 billion to $1.665 billion dollars. We expect year-over-year revenue to be down 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 76% or $1.25 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. LiveOffice is expected to contribute between $7 million and $8 million to our September quarter revenue. 
As a result of raising $1 billion in senior notes during June, our interest expense for the next 4 quarters will be higher by $8 million per quarter. This will decrease EPS by $0.008 per quarter for a total of approximately $0.03 of dilution through June 2013. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.15 and $0.19 as compared to $0.24 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.39, down 10% to flat on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.49 billion and $3.55 billion. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
I'd like to remind everyone that the September quarter typically produces the lowest quarterly operating cash flow of each year. Lastly, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.23 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.41 and the end-of-period rate of $1.34 per euro in the September 2011 quarter. Our $1.23 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 13% from our weighted average rate in the year-ago period and a decrease of 4% sequentially. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 710 million shares. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

Some background on that is they did look at and did a dry search actually before the decision was made to promote Enrique 3 years ago and it just turns out coincidentally I was on the short list for that decision 3 years ago. So although the search was never commenced and the decision was made to hire Enrique. So no, I'm the CEO and I've told my wife, this might be a 5-year deal, it might be a 3-year deal but the commitment I made to the board when I took the job is that I will do this job until I'm comfortable we're in a position and have either an internal candidate, preferably, that like we did at Intuit turning over the reins to Brad Smith. I will not turn over the leadership of this company until I've been able to get it on a course I'm comfortable with and my goal would be to stay on as Chairman at that point so I have a long-term involvement. And in the mix of what the roles are and how that shapes out will be determined by our ability to make sure we've got the leadership in place to help the company achieve the strategy we're going to set out."

And then maybe just as a backup question to the prior analyst, when you think about cash flow of your coming in at $340 million and being seasonally low, it would appear difficult that it would actually grow year-on-year just given where DSOs are at 34 days for the quarter.

Janice and her team have put together a remarkable string of quarters of continued and consistent growth. And obviously, we are very focused on continuing that. Underlying that is the fundamental strength of our core products that get terrific reviews consistently, while at the same time, we're very much focused on bringing new services to market as we talked about in our prepared remarks, very much oriented around the mobile world. And I think underpinning all of that is the investment that we've put in recent years into the e-commerce engine, which offers us such greater granularity into pricing, the behavior of different segments of our customer base on a geographic basis. So we're able to continue learning, continue developing in order to allow us this consistent ability to upsell and cross sell, which drives the growth, as we in essence, see and develop our place in the newer mobile space. So that's the strategy. We're absolutely focused in continuing on that and as we execute, I think there's more opportunity for the Consumer business to grow. So we're pleased by how that is consistently developing. Now in terms of cash flow, obviously I did note earlier how we had an FX headwind. And certainly looking at how the euro is going, it's perfectly plausible that there would be those continuing headwinds for the next several months. We'll see. But that said, we're very focused on continuing to grow the top line. We've got a strong set of products and services that are very relevant to the marketplaces in which we operate. Yes, we have a problem in the Backup Exec area. We're really focused on sorting that out. And with that focus, with that level of effort, we'll keep building the cash flow. And it is volatile, more volatile than an accounting metric obviously, in any 1 quarter but I think we have plenty of opportunity ahead."

Frankly, my conclusion of that is there's a lot of companies out there that should be using this because it's better than anything I'd seen. And so what do you do with that now as a company? I mean we've built it internally. It's awesome. So that's the kind of thing, Gregg, that I've got to learn more about and say hey, this is an asset. Are we really leveraging this in the way that we could or we are just using it internal? Now, there may be something there, there may not be anything there. So is it another I've given Enrique credit for. We have a performance management system for the organization here that's pretty robust. That's pretty important as we move forward. So there's organizational things, there's assets in the customer and marketing area. I think there's a lot of question. To be honest, I have the same questions as many of you would have and those are all things I'm going to take on in this listening and learning tour and I'll be much better prepared to talk about that as we get together here again toward the end of the year, 120 days from now.

Symantec has very strong assets in many areas. The customers' needs are changing dramatically and radically. As I said, our goal is to lead in the future mobile interconnected world like we did on the desktop PC world. So I believe, and I'm very sensitive, we did not change the mission at Intuit but it was broad enough to allow us to change the strategy. And so I don't know, to be honest. I don't believe we will be constrained by the mission of Symantec. I'd like to be consistent there that it does not constrain us but that's one of the questions I'm going to have to figure out.

Look, the best thing I can do again is bring a philosophy that was developed at GE and applied it in Intuit, which is I don't start with whether it's subscription or whether it's desktop or license. I start with how do we solve an important customer problem, how do we deliver that product or service, I actually call it an offering so we don't have a debate of whether it's a product or a service and how do we be ubiquitous to tell customers want to buy? Because I'm indifferent if they bought TurboTax on the web or as a Sofware-as-a-Service or in a desktop. What I want to do is win the product offering game, solve that problem than anybody else them, however they want to buy it. Is it a license? Is it an appliance? Is it a Sofware-as-a-Service subscription? I want to be better than anybody else at meeting that customer need and I don't want to start with growing -- I think the outcome of that, based on the secular trends, is we're going to see more Sofware-as-a-Service and all that but I want to be the best appliance solution and the best license solutions and the best subscription offering Sofware-as-a-Service solution and let customers pick what's right for them. And small businesses, consumers, different enterprises might pick different solutions. If you had to say how you're going to prioritize or what's your thinking going into it? Look, I think we want to escape to where the folks are going, not to where it's been. We're going to be much more focused on the emerging and the future needs and I think we're going to have to accelerate our pace and rate of change away from winning in the past to winning in the future and that may take some courage and some leadership from our team.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis only. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the June 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.28 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.27 per euro, compared to the guided rate of $1.32. For the June '11 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.45. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on the website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

We apologize for the last-minute change but because of the announcement, we saw that was the right thing to do to make this change on short notice. So I'm really glad to be here on our earnings call and my first day on my new job. 
The decision to replace Enrique was a tough one. It was not based on any particular event or issue but one that the board made after reflection on the ongoing company performance. While progress has been made over the last 3 years in many areas, it was the board's decision that making a change now was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. Enrique has been a significant contributor during his 19 years at Symantec. Throughout his time and especially during his last 3 years as CEO, Enrique showed an incredible dedication to customers and strong enthusiasm to pursue new emerging opportunities. I want to recognize and thank him for his considerable commitment and wish him the best in the future. 
My perspective is while the company has very strong assets, we are underperforming against the opportunities and I'm very excited about working with our leaders to speed up the pace at which we create value for all of our stakeholders. My first order of business will be to speak with our customers, partners and shareholders, and over the next 90 to 120 days I'm going on a tour to listen, learn and work with the leadership team to figure out the right strategy to leverage all of Symantec resources to accelerate our rate of value creation. Once this tour is completed, I'll share our go-forward strategy to win in the marketplace and how we're going to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth. This is a process I've used before many times in the past. It's been successful and I look forward to applying this similar playbook at Symantec. With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review the quarterly highlights and financial details."
35000,212741111,331023,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Let me start by welcoming you, Steve, to the management team and I look forward to working closely with you to drive value creation at Symantec.

Let me start by welcoming you, Steve, to the management team and I look forward to working closely with you to drive value creation at Symantec. Now, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our consumer results were driven by ongoing cross-selling and up-selling. The consumer security products continue to demonstrate best-in-class quality, winning over 250 awards in the past 2 years. Though early in their product lifecycle, our newest premium suites, Norton One and Norton 360 Everywhere have received very positive feedback, with Norton One earning the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine. We also refreshed and extended our portfolio to target the growing number of Mac users. 
Norton Online Backup and NortonLive solutions maintained their strong performance and continued to be meaningful contributors to the growth of our business. Our Norton Mobile Security solution maintained its leadership position in the mobile security market as we surpassed Lookout as the top-grossing security app in the Google Play marketplace. While still a nascent market, our products continue to receive top reviews, with Norton Mobile Security earning 4.4 stars in Google Play. We also signed new Norton Mobile Security partnerships with several leading wireless retailers and carriers in all 3 regions. 
On the enterprise side, our backup, archiving and eDiscovery solutions continue to drive momentum. Our enterprise backup business continues to be driven by customers' desire to minimize complexity and backup challenges without complicating recovery. With 3 Best of VMWorld awards, Symantec is the industry leader in VMware and Hyper-V backup. Only Symantec offers a single product capable of providing true individual file recovery, deduplication and policy management across the VMWare, Hyper-V and traditional physical servers. 
Let me spend a moment on an area where we didn't execute to our high standards on a new product launch. While we delivered a much improved user interface for Backup Exec, we excluded specific functionality that customers still required. As such, we have now reinstated this functionality to further simplify the backup process. We expect it will take 2 to 3 quarters to get Backup Exec back on track. 
Our backup appliance business is gaining significant traction and has been well received by customers and the industry alike. Our 5220 appliance won the Backup and Recovery Award at Microsoft's Best of TechEd 2012 event. In the June quarter, we delivered our first appliance for the midmarket and we continue to grow our Appliance business by expanding our portfolio into additional geographies. 
The quality of our endpoint protection product, SEP 12, continues to garner industry acclaim. Third-party research has confirmed that SEP 12 uses less computing power to provide greater protection than competitive offerings. In addition, at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, the quality of SEP was identified as a primary threat to our competitors. 
Trust Services, our SSL certificate business, had another strong quarter. We continue to differentiate our premium and value SSL brands, driving growth in both market segments. We've also simplified and streamlined our online enrollment process, which will be rolled out to other geographies throughout the year. 
Our Data Loss Prevention solutions saw strong growth across all of our geographies, including an increased appetite for DLP in Europe. We are winning competitive bids by demonstrating our market-leading capability to protect sensitive information from the desktop to the server. We rolled out DLP for tablets in fiscal 2012 to accommodate the breadth of devices in use and plan to extend support to the iPhone later this year. 
eDiscovery and cloud-based archiving exceeded our expectations this quarter, as we leveraged the scope and scale of the Symantec sales force. Both products were named leaders in their respective Gartner Magic Quadrants as customers reported that our solutions were easy to buy, implement and use. 
User authentication continued its strong growth in the first quarter. We continue to gain market share as customers choose our Software-as-a-Service-based authentication solution for its ease-of-use and best-in-class security. As governments and businesses deliver more online services requiring security, we expect to see continued growth for these services. 
Leveraging our user authentication technology, our security for the cloud solution, O3, signed its first large enterprise customer and continues to garner significant attention. Enterprises are rapidly shifting their software needs to the cloud and the security and visibility O3 offers addresses a critical customer need. 
We made significant progress towards developing the first complete enterprise mobility solution, including device and application management, data protection and full compliance capabilities. While we work towards integrating these, best-of-breed capabilities, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers. 
Moving now to the financial details, we posted better-than-expected first quarter results to each of our key financial metrics for which we guide: revenue, deferred revenue and EPS. 
GAAP revenue totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 4% versus the June 2011 period. Our Clearwell and LiveOffice acquisitions together accounted for $24 million of total revenue. Our organic constant currency revenue growth rate for the June quarter was 1% year-over-year. Despite the U.S. dollar strengthening by approximately 11% against the euro year-over-year, our results were better than expected. Total foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by 3 percentage points, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 1%. 
Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 6%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 2%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and Software-as-a-Service offerings, grew 10% and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 42% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year-ago period. 
The Consumer business generated revenue of $521 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by upselling customers to our premium suites and growing our emerging businesses, such as online backup, NortonLive Services and our mobile applications. 
The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $584 million, an increase of 1% as compared to the June 2011 quarter driven by continued growth in our backup and archiving business. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 6% year-over-year, driven by our appliances, cloud-based archiving and eDiscovery solutions. Revenue from the storage and availability management business declined 8% year-over-year. This business continues to be highly profitable and generates strong cash flow for the company. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $501 million, up 10% year-over-year as our endpoint protection business continues to gain market share with enterprise customers. Our authentication services and data loss prevention solutions continued to post double-digit growth. 
This is the first quarter of year-over-year growth for our Services business since we transitioned our consulting services to specialized partners. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 140 basis points to 84.3%, as higher costs are associated with these businesses, a trend we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1%, down 60 basis points compared to the June 2011 quarter. Operating margins were better than we expected in the June quarter due to lower-than-expected OEM fees, which accounted for approximately $0.01 of benefit to EPS. In addition, ongoing cost controls decreased expenses as we continue to tightly manage our expense structure. 
Improved operating leverage from better-than-expected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. Net income of $309 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Continued growth in subscriptions and maintenance contributed to deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.75 billion. 
We exited the June quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which was an increase of 79% year-over-year, driven primarily by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14 and the sale of our 49% stake in the Huawei-Symantec joint venture. As we exited the June quarter, approximately 47% of our cash balance resided in the U.S., which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from our June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 30% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. 
We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $301 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 19 million shares at an average price of $15.59. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted operating cash flow by $12 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $340 million. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2012 quarter. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, we expect GAAP revenue for the September 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.635 billion to $1.665 billion dollars. We expect year-over-year revenue to be down 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 76% or $1.25 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. LiveOffice is expected to contribute between $7 million and $8 million to our September quarter revenue. 
As a result of raising $1 billion in senior notes during June, our interest expense for the next 4 quarters will be higher by $8 million per quarter. This will decrease EPS by $0.008 per quarter for a total of approximately $0.03 of dilution through June 2013. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.15 and $0.19 as compared to $0.24 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.39, down 10% to flat on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.49 billion and $3.55 billion. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
I'd like to remind everyone that the September quarter typically produces the lowest quarterly operating cash flow of each year. Lastly, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.23 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.41 and the end-of-period rate of $1.34 per euro in the September 2011 quarter. Our $1.23 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 13% from our weighted average rate in the year-ago period and a decrease of 4% sequentially. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 710 million shares. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

And then above that, I think a lot of companies, now that I've been involved in, are evaluating the best way to return excess cash to shareholders. And so, that's a discussion that we're having. We don't have any decisions or any change in direction at this point but that's something. And then I think obviously, we want to look hard at adjusted rate of return on acquisitions that is accretive to our portfolio. I give Enrique and James and the team credit for really putting a lot more rigor in the acquisition process at Symantec over the last couple of years, both on the pricing, the negotiations and the integration, and I think the results have been better. So I think that we're going to continue to think about how we return excess cash to shareholders. I think the company will continue to produce excess cash and that we will produce more cash than we will spend on acquisitions. So the real question is what's the most thoughtful way to return that to shareholders. And I think that will be an ongoing discussion for the board and if we change some thoughts on how to deal with that, I think we'll let you know. But it is a topic that's on the agenda for discussions."

Janice and her team have put together a remarkable string of quarters of continued and consistent growth. And obviously, we are very focused on continuing that. Underlying that is the fundamental strength of our core products that get terrific reviews consistently, while at the same time, we're very much focused on bringing new services to market as we talked about in our prepared remarks, very much oriented around the mobile world. And I think underpinning all of that is the investment that we've put in recent years into the e-commerce engine, which offers us such greater granularity into pricing, the behavior of different segments of our customer base on a geographic basis. So we're able to continue learning, continue developing in order to allow us this consistent ability to upsell and cross sell, which drives the growth, as we in essence, seed and develop our place in the newer mobile space. So that's the strategy. We're absolutely focused in continuing on that and as we execute, I think there's more opportunity for the Consumer business to grow. So we're pleased by how that is consistently developing. Now in terms of cash flow, obviously I did note earlier how we had an FX headwind. And certainly looking at how the euro is going, it's perfectly plausible that there would be those continuing headwinds for the next several months, we'll see. But that said, we're very focused on continuing to grow the top line. We've got a strong set of products and services that are very relevant to the marketplaces in which we operate. Yes, we have a problem in the Backup Exec area. We're really focused on sorting that out. And with that focus, with that level of effort, we'll keep building the cash flow. And it is volatile, more volatile than an accounting metric obviously, in any 1 quarter but I think we have plenty of opportunity ahead."

When I -- all I can do is give you kind of my experience at Intuit, which is the most relevant, which the mission statement has revolutionized people's lives by solving important problems. And it was an unconstraining mission statement because there's a lot of problems but the logic there was uncover important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else in the world and make money. And that's the same logic I'm going to apply at Symantec. I learned that from Scott Cook and Bill Campbell at Intuit. I think it was very powerful, simple strategic logic. Symantec has very strong assets in many areas. The customers' needs are changing dramatically and radically. As I said, our goal is to lead in the future mobile interconnected world like we did on the desktop PC world. So I believe, and I'm very sensitive, we did not change the mission at Intuit but it was broad enough to allow us to change the strategy. And so, I don't know. To be honest, I don't believe we will be constrained by the mission of Symantec. I'd like to be consistent there if it does not constrain us but that's one of the questions I'm going to have to figure out. I will not be constrained in how I think about finding important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else in the world and make money. And that will be the foundation for the strategy this company is going to move forward on."

Look, the best thing I can do again is bring a philosophy that was developed at GE and applied at Intuit, which is I don't start with whether it's subscription or whether it's desktop or license. I start with how do we solve an important customer problem, how do we deliver that product or service? I actually call it an offering so we don't have a debate of whether it's a product or a service and how to be ubiquitous to how customers want to buy? Because I'm indifferent if they bought TurboTax on the web or as a Sofware-as-a-Service or in a desktop. What I want to do is win the product offering game, solve that problem than anybody else, however they want to buy it. Is it a license? Is it an appliance? Is it a Sofware-as-a-Service subscription? I want to be better than anybody else at meeting that customer need and I don't want to start with growing -- Now I think the outcome of that, based on the secular trends, is we're going to see more Sofware-as-a-Service and all that but I want to be the best appliance solution and the best license solution and the best subscription offering Sofware-as-a-Service solution and let customers pick what's right for them. And small businesses, consumers, different enterprises might pick different solutions. If you had to say how you're going to prioritize or what's your thinking going into it? Look, I think we want to skate to where the puck's going, not to where it's been. And so we're going to be much more focused on the emerging and the future needs and I think we're going to have to accelerate our pace and rate of change away from winning in the past to winning in the future and that may take some courage and some leadership from our team. But that's what we're going to do."

I think the big, big leverage point and the big decisions will be sorting through the reality of how the market's evolving to your point and figuring out where to place our chips. So I would defer, I don't think there's going to be any big strategic decisions. And look, I want to travel around the world. I'm going to go to India, I've got to visit all of our customers. So there's a lot for me to learn, not just about the strategy but part of this is learning  the organization's capability to execute the new strategy and make them part of the process.

I think it's all part of getting the organization mobilized and starting that so we can execute the new strategy, however that comes down. So I actually think that's an important part of this process. If it was just the strategy process for presentation, I could do it faster than 90 days. But the big part of this is making sure I'm working the organizational and change management part of this, which I've got a long track record of doing multiple times, to produce excellent results. And so that's what takes more time than just the strategy. Look, to me it's an integrated process and that's why it will take the kind of timeframes I talked about."

He will make a few opening remarks, then James will provide quarterly highlights and review our financial results as well as guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. 
Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available shortly after the call is completed. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings-per-share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis only. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the June 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.28 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.27 per euro, compared to the guided rate of $1.32. For the June '11 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.45. 
We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on the website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. 
And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

We apologize for the last-minute change, but because of the announcement, we felt it was the right thing to do to make this change on short notice. So I'm really glad to be here on our earnings call and my first day on my new job. 
The decision to replace Enrique was a tough one. It was not based on any particular event or issue but one that the board made after reflection on the ongoing company performance. While progress has been made over the last 3 years in many areas, it was the board's decision that making a change now was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. Enrique has been a significant contributor during his 19 years at Symantec. Throughout his time, and especially during his last 3 years as CEO, Enrique showed an incredible dedication to customers and strong enthusiasm to pursue new emerging opportunities. I want to recognize and thank him for his considerable commitment and wish him the best in the future. 
My perspective is while the company has very strong assets, we are underperforming against the opportunities.  And I'm very excited about working with our leaders to speed up the pace at which we create value for all of our stakeholders. My first order of business will be to speak with our customers, partners and shareholders, and over the next 90 to 120 days I'm going on a tour to listen, learn and work with the leadership team to figure out the right strategy to leverage all of Symantec resources to accelerate our rate of value creation. Once this tour is completed, I'll share our go-forward strategy to win in the marketplace and how we're going to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth. This is a process I've used before many times in the past. It's been successful, and I look forward to applying this similar playbook at Symantec. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review the quarterly highlights and financial details."

Let me start by welcoming you, Steve, to the management team, and I look forward to working closely with you to drive value creation at Symantec. Now, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our consumer results were driven by ongoing cross-selling and up-selling. The consumer security products continue to demonstrate best-in-class quality, winning over 250 awards in the past 2 years. Though early in their product life cycle, our newest premium suites, Norton One and Norton 360 Everywhere, have received very positive feedback, with Norton One earning the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine. We also refreshed and extended our portfolio to target the growing number of Mac users. 
Norton Online Backup and NortonLive solutions maintained their strong performance and continued to be meaningful contributors to the growth of our business. Our Norton Mobile Security solution maintained its leadership position in the mobile security market as we surpassed Lookout as the top-grossing security app in the Google Play marketplace. While still a nascent market, our products continue to receive top reviews, with Norton Mobile Security earning 4.4 stars in Google Play. We also signed new Norton Mobile Security partnerships with several leading wireless retailers and carriers in all 3 regions. 
On the enterprise side, our backup, archiving and eDiscovery solutions continue to drive momentum. Our enterprise backup business continues to be driven by customers' desire to minimize complexity and backup challenges without complicating recovery. With 3 Best of VMworld awards, Symantec is the industry leader in VMware and Hyper-V backup. Only Symantec offers a single product capable of providing true individual file recovery, deduplication and policy management across the VMware, Hyper-V and traditional physical servers. 
Let me spend a moment on an area where we didn't execute to our high standards on a new product launch. While we delivered a much improved user interface For Backup Exec, we excluded specific functionality that customers still required. As such, we have now reinstated this functionality to further simplify the backup process. We expect it will take 2 to 3 quarters to get Backup Exec back on track. 
Our backup appliance business is gaining significant traction and has been well received by customers and the industry alike. Our 5220 appliance won the Backup and Recovery Award at Microsoft's Best of TechEd 2012 event. In the June quarter, we delivered our first appliance for the midmarket, and we continued to grow our Appliance business by expanding our portfolio into additional geographies. 
The quality of our endpoint protection product, SEP 12, continues to garner industry acclaim. Third-party research has confirmed that SEP 12 uses less computing power to provide greater protection than competitive offerings. In addition, at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, the quality of SEP was identified as a primary threat to our competitors. 
Trust Services, our SSL certificate business, had another strong quarter. We continue to differentiate our premium and value SSL brands, driving growth in both market segments. We've also simplified and streamlined our online enrollment process, which will be rolled out to other geographies throughout the year. 
Our Data Loss Prevention solutions saw strong growth across all of our geographies, including an increased appetite for DLP in Europe. We are winning competitive bids by demonstrating our market-leading capability to protect sensitive information from the desktop to the server. We rolled out DLP for tablets in fiscal 2012 to accommodate the breadth of devices in use and plan to extend support to the iPhone later this year. 
eDiscovery and cloud-based archiving exceeded our expectations this quarter, as we leveraged the scope and scale of the Symantec sales force. Both products were named leaders in their respective Gartner Magic Quadrants as customers reported that our solutions were easy to buy, implement and use. 
User authentication continued its strong growth in the first quarter. We continue to gain market share as customers choose our Software-as-a-Service-based authentication solution for its ease of use and best-in-class security. As governments and businesses deliver more online services requiring security, we expect to see continued growth for these services. 
Leveraging our user authentication technology, our security for the cloud solution, O3, signed its first large enterprise customer and continues to garner significant attention. Enterprises are rapidly shifting their software needs to the cloud, and the security and visibility O3 offers addresses a critical customer need. 
We made significant progress towards developing the first complete enterprise mobility solution, including device and application management, data protection and full compliance capabilities. While we work towards integrating these best-of-breed capabilities, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers. 
Moving now to the financial details.  We posted better-than-expected first quarter results to each of our key financial metrics for which we guide: revenue, deferred revenue and EPS. 
GAAP revenue totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 4% versus the June 2011 period. Our Clearwell and LiveOffice acquisitions together accounted for $24 million of total revenue. Our organic constant currency revenue growth rate for the June quarter was 1% year-over-year. Despite the U.S. dollar strengthening by approximately 11% against the euro year-over-year, our results were better than expected. Total foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by 3 percentage points, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 1%. 
Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 6%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 2%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and Software-as-a-Service offerings, grew 10% and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 42% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year-ago period. 
The Consumer business generated revenue of $521 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by upselling customers to our premium suites and growing our emerging businesses, such as Online Backup, NortonLive Services and our mobile applications. 
The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $584 million, an increase of 1% as compared to the June 2011 quarter, driven by continued growth in our backup and archiving business. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 6% year-over-year, driven by our appliances, cloud-based archiving and eDiscovery solutions. Revenue from the storage and availability management business declined 8% year-over-year. This business continues to be highly profitable and generates strong cash flow for the company. 
The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $501 million, up 10% year-over-year, as our endpoint protection business continues to gain market share with enterprise customers. Our authentication services and data loss prevention solutions continued to post double-digit growth. 
This is the first quarter of year-over-year growth for our Services business since we transitioned our consulting services to specialized partners. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 140 basis points to 84.3%, as higher costs are associated with these businesses, a trend we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1%, down 60 basis points compared to the June 2011 quarter. Operating margins were better than we expected in the June quarter due to lower-than-expected OEM fees which accounted for approximately $0.01 of benefit to EPS. In addition, ongoing cost controls decreased expenses as we continued to tightly manage our expense structure. 
Improved operating leverage from better-than-expected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. Net income of $309 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Continued growth in subscriptions and maintenance contributed to deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.75 billion. 
We exited the June quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which was an increase of 79% year-over-year, driven primarily by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14 and the sale of our 49% stake in the Huawei-Symantec joint venture. As we exited the June quarter, approximately 47% of our cash balance resided in the U.S., which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from our June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 30% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. 
We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $301 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 19 million shares at an average price of $15.59. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted operating cash flow by $12 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $340 million. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2012 quarter. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, we expect GAAP revenue for the September 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.635 billion to $1.665 billion dollars. We expect year-over-year revenue to be down 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 76% or $1.25 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. LiveOffice is expected to contribute between $7 million and $8 million to our September quarter revenue. 
As a result of raising $1 billion in senior notes during June, our interest expense for the next 4 quarters will be higher by $8 million per quarter. This will decrease EPS by $0.008 per quarter for a total of approximately $0.03 of dilution through June of 2013. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.15 and $0.19 as compared to $0.24 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.39, down 10% to flat on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.49 billion and $3.55 billion. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% in constant currency. 
I'd like to remind everyone that the September quarter typically produces the lowest quarterly operating cash flow of each year. Lastly, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.23 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.41 and the end-of-period rate of $1.34 per euro in the September 2011 quarter. Our $1.23 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 13% from our weighted average rate in the year-ago period and a decrease of 4% sequentially. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 710 million shares.

We don't have any decisions or any change in direction at this point, but that's something. And then I think obviously, we want to look hard at adjusted rate of return on acquisitions that is accretive to our portfolio. I give Enrique and James and team credit for really putting a lot more rigor in the acquisition process at Symantec over the last couple of years, both on the pricing, the negotiations and the integration, and I think the results have been better. So I think that we're going to continue to think about how we return excess cash to shareholders. I think the company will continue to produce excess cash and that we will produce more cash than we will spend on acquisitions. So the real question is what's the most thoughtful way to return that to shareholders?

Can you just talk to us directionally on how you see, given that you have the deferred revenue visibility that maybe we don't have, how do you expect the Consumer business to trend over the next -- or over the year, I should say? And then maybe just as a backup question to the prior analyst, when you think about cash flow, you're coming in at $340 million and seasonally low, it would appear difficult that it would actually grow year-on-year just given where DSOs are at 34 days for the quarter.

Janice and her team have put together a remarkable string of quarters of continued and consistent growth. And obviously, we are very focused on continuing that. Underlying that is the fundamental strength of our core products that get terrific reviews consistently, while at the same time, we're very much focused on bringing new services to market, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, very much oriented around the mobile world. And I think underpinning all of that is the investment that we've put in recent years into the e-commerce engine, which offers us such greater granularity into pricing, the behavior of different segments of our customer base on a geographic basis. So we're able to continue learning, continue developing in order to allow us this consistent ability to upsell and cross-sell, which drives the growth as we, in essence, seed and develop our place in the newer mobile space. So that's the strategy. We're absolutely focused in continuing on that, and as we execute, I think there's more opportunity for the Consumer business to grow. So we're pleased by how that is consistently developing. Now in terms of cash flow, obviously, I did note earlier how we had an FX headwind. And certainly, looking at how the euro is going, it's perfectly plausible that there would be those continuing headwinds for the next several months.  We'll see. But that said, we're very focused on continuing to grow the top line. We've got a strong set of products and services that are very relevant to the marketplaces in which we operate. Yes, we have a problem in the Backup Exec area. We're really focused on sorting that out. And with that focus, with that level of effort, we'll keep building the cash flow. And it is volatile, more volatile than an accounting metric, obviously, in any 1 quarter, but I think we have plenty of opportunity ahead."

So there's some things I know, but there's a lot of things I don't know. The board actually went through and did a tour on Monday of the -- I think it was Monday now -- of the new e-commerce platform that Janice and her team built that James referred to earlier, and I saw just an incredible e-commerce platform, that I say this is an unbelievable asset in our A-B testing capability, and the team that is running that is very exciting. Frankly, my conclusion on that is, ""Boy, there's a lot of companies out there that should be using this, because it's better than anything I'd seen.  And so what do you do with that now as a company? I mean, we've built it internally. It's awesome.""  So that's the kind of thing, Gregg, that I've got to learn more about and say, ""Hey, this is an asset. Are we really leveraging this in the way that we could, or we are just using it internal?""  Now there may be something there.  There may not be anything there. So it's another -- I'd give Enrique credit for. I mean, we have a performance management system for the organization here that's pretty robust.  That's pretty important as we move forward. So there's organizational things, there's assets in the customer and marketing area. I think there's a lot of questions. To be honest, I bet I have the same questions that many of you would have, and those are all things I'm going to take on in this listening and learning tour, and I'll be much better prepared to talk about that as we get together here again toward the end of the year, 120 days from now.

And that's the same logic I'm going to apply at Symantec. I learned that from Scott Cook and Bill Campbell at Intuit. I think it was very powerful, simple, strategic logic. Symantec has very strong assets in many areas. The customers' needs are changing dramatically and radically. As I said, our goal is to lead in the future mobile interconnected world like we did on the desktop PC world. So I believe, and I'm very sensitive, we did not change the mission at Intuit, but it was broad enough to allow us to change the strategy. And so I don't know, to be honest.  I don't believe we will be constrained by the mission of Symantec. I'd like to be consistent there if it does not constrain us, but that's one of the questions I'm going to have to figure out. I will not be constrained in how I think about finding important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else in the world and make money.

Look, the best thing I can do, again, is bring a philosophy that was developed at GE and applied at Intuit, which is I don't start with whether it's subscription or whether it's desktop or license. I start with how do we solve an important customer problem?  How do we deliver that product or service? I actually call it an offering so we don't have a debate of whether it's a product or a service.  And how do we be ubiquitous to how customers want to buy? Because I'm indifferent if they bought TurboTax on the web or as a Software-as-a-Service or on a desktop. What I want to do is win the product offering game, solve that problem than anybody else, however they want to buy it. Is it a license? Is it an appliance? Is it a Software-as-a-Service subscription? I want to be better than anybody else at meeting that customer need, and I don't want to start with growing -- now I think the outcome of that, based on the secular trends, is we're going to see more Software-as-a-Service and all that.  But I want to be the best appliance solution and the best license solution and the best subscription-offering Software-as-a-Service solution and let customers pick what's right for them. And small businesses, consumers, different enterprises might pick different solutions. If you had to say, ""How are you going to prioritize?"" or, ""What's your thinking going into it?""  Look, I think we want to skate to where the puck's going, not to where it's been. And so we're going to be much more focused on the emerging and the future needs, and I think we're going to have to accelerate our pace and rate of change away from winning in the past to winning in the future.  And that may take some courage and some leadership from our team. But that's what we're going to do."

This compared to the September 2011 quarter where the actual weighted average rate was $1.41 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary of actual and currency-adjusted growth rate in our press release tables and in our supplemental information which are available on the IR website.

Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release and on the IR website. And now, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

When the company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to r",780,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When the company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to report that the team stepped up during this transition. While working on our plan to change and improve the company for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders, we executed well in the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results. While the team focused on delivering in the current quarter, we are also working on creating value over a longer term time horizon. 
Starting with a clean sheet of paper, the team is hard at work developing a strategy and operational plant that will help us deliver even more value for our customers and partners. So we went in the market and improved our financial performance. Our goal is to deliver strategy and plan that will consistently deliver greater than 5% organic growth and 30% operating margins within the next 2 to 3 years. At this point, we believe we will reach sustained greater than 30% operating margins faster than 5% sustained organic growth. This plan will be one that both the leadership team and the board believe we can deliver against in the short and long-term. 
In the meantime, we are also -- we also continue to evaluate all of our strategic alternatives to create shareholder value and believe we are on track to share our new strategic direction and operational plan in late January of 2013. We are moving to quickly change so we can continue to improve our performance on a global basis. With more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., we can no longer operate like a US-based company with global distribution. 
As you can see from our recent history, our growth rates are higher outside the U.S. Our head of worldwide sales will be leaving the company. To better position us to win globally, we've decided to elevate the geo leadership roles and have them report directly to me. This move expands the scope of our regional leaders, making them ambassadors and general managers of their geographies. While a primary focus will be sales in their geographies, they will also play an expanded Symantec leadership role. We believe this will allow us to accelerate our pace of change and make better and faster decisions so we perform at a higher level on both a global and local basis. 
I'd like to spend a moment on our guidance for the December quarter. We're pleased that our revenue and deferred revenue continue to grow year-over-year sequentially, especially in this uncertain global economic environment. However, operating margin is lower in the December quarter than either the September or year ago December quarters. This may seem counter to what I told you in September, that we would self-fund investments without reducing operating margin. And that's still my commitment. 
After our January announcement, we will self-fund this and future investments without reducing operating margin. But we need to make these investments now and not wait until after the January announcement to set the foundation for longer-term organic growth. The investments will be allocated to areas like technical support so we better serve our customers and partners. This is the right thing to do to create long-term shareholder value, no matter where we come out on our strategy and operational plan announcement in late January. 
Over the past 90 days, I met with front-line employees, customers and partners, industry experts and shareholders all around the world. Our customers are saying what you probably already know. They want us and need us to become better and to win but think we're getting in our own way. We must become more customer and partner solutions focused rather than product-specific. We must move faster to solve their future versus their past problems. And we must become easier to do business with unless fragmented as a company to become a better and stronger partner. 
I've been positively surprised by the amount of unmet and underserved needs customers have in this challenging and fast-moving security and information management market. And while I still have a lot to learn, I can say with confidence that there are plenty of big opportunities for Symantec. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need to think and act differently, both strategically and operationally in ways that leverage all of our significant assets to better solve our customers most important problems. And that's what the January announcement will be all about. With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our quarterly results."

We've posted better-than-expected second quarter results with record September revenue and deferred revenue, as well as strong operating margins and EPS. These results drove our organic constant currency revenue growth to 3% for the September quarter year-over-year. GAAP revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion, driven by strengthen in our Security and Information Management businesses. Our hosted archiving acquisition of LiveOffice contributed $10 million in revenue, which was better than expected. Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, content, maintenance and subscription revenue grew 7% while license revenue declined 9%. Subscription revenue, which includes our Consumer, authentication, MSS and SaaS offerings grew 10% and accounted for 45% of total revenue as compared to 42% of revenue in the year ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our Consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compares to 12% of revenue in the year-ago period. 
We recorded a strong quarter in our Consumer business despite the challenges we've seen across the PC industry. The Consumer business grew 3% year-over-year to $528 million in January to its 60 consecutive quarter of growth. These results were driven by a up-selling customers to our premium suites as improved pricing and growing our emerging back-up, NortonLive Services and mobile businesses. 
Our Consumer business is ready for the release of Windows 8. In third-party testing, Windows 8 run 50% faster and 20% safer when paired with our new Norton solutions versus machines running the Windows Defender alternative. PCs with preinstalled Norton trialware will begin shipping with the Windows 8 launch on October 26. 
Moving on to the Enterprise, the Storage and Server Management segment which consists of our information management and storage and availability management businesses grew 2% and generated revenue of $595 million. Revenue from the Information Management business increased 2% year-over-year, driven by NetBackup and appliances but offset by weakness in our Backup Exec product. Sales of our Backup Appliances continued their momentum as we expanded our footprint across more geographies. Customers continue to be attracted to our integrated Backup and deduplication offering, which is proving to be an easier to deploy solution with a lower total cost of ownership. 
We are also seeing good traction building for our Backup Exec Appliance which was just launched last quarter. We continue to work through our Backup Exec software challenges. We are focusing on restoring some of the functions and performance characteristics that were available with the older versions of the product. We are making progress but there's more work to do. Revenue in our storage and availability management business increased 1% year-over-year as we see customers continuing to deploy more mission-critical applications on Linux and virtualized infrastructures. Headwinds from the decline in our customer's usage of the Solaris platform are being offset by increased penetration in both the Linux and Windows platforms. This business continues to be highly profitable, generating strong cash flow for the company. 
The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year and generated revenue of $512 million driven by double-digit growth in all of our emerging security businesses and our continued leadership n Endpoint Protection. In particular, SEP 12 continues its success in the large Enterprise segment. This was particularly true in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region where we want several competitive tenders with large governments and corporations. 
Data Loss Prevention was one of our security businesses that recorded double-digit growth. EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan, both geographies that have traditionally being slower to adopt DLP are now seeing an uptick in demand for our solutions as demonstrated by several large financial services wins. Our Trust Services business continues to perform well, in part because SSL authentication is now being used to protect all interactions with many corporate websites, not just those webpages involving monetary transactions. 
Our Services business grew 7% year-over-year to $64 million in revenue. Turning now to total company margins, consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and Appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 80 basis points to 84.6%. Given the higher cost of goods sold associated with these businesses, we expect this gross margin trend to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin grew 250 basis points year-over-year to 27.5%. Operating margins were better-than-expected due to higher revenue and lower spending across the company. 
Net income of $322 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45. Improved operating leverage from better-than-projected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.04. Lower-than-forecasted PC OEMs fees accounted for $0.01 per share of improvement and types of spending across the company accounted for approximately $0.02 of benefit to EPS. 
Continued growth in our subscriptions and maintenance businesses drove deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.62 billion. We exited the September quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments driven, in part, by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14. 
As we exited the September quarter, approximately 42% of our cash balance resided in the U.S. which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from the June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 23% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $200 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 12.1 million shares at an average price of $16.48. Symantec has $483 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan. 
Cash flow from operating activities was in lower year-over-year driven by higher tax and severance payments, as well as lower previous quarter buildings which, in turn, impacted September quarter cash collections. Foreign currency movements also negatively impacted operating cash flow by $18 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $178 million. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2012 quarter. We expect GAAP revenue for the December 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion, flat to up 2% on as-reported basis and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 73% or $1.27 billion of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. GAAP earnings-per-share are estimated to be between $0.17 and $0.19 as compared to $0.32 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.38 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period. EPS is projected to be lower due to our decision to spend more in the coming quarter in areas that will better serve our customers needs. 
In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our interest expense is higher by approximately $0.01 due to our recent debt offering and we are expecting another $0.02 impact driven by a higher tax rate, foreign exchange movements and the liquidation of certain accounting entities as we work to further simplify our operating structure. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.765 billion and $3.825 billion, up 3% to 4% on both on as-reported in constant-currency basis. Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.35 and the end of period rate of $1.30 per euro in the December 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 4% from our weighted average rate in the year ago period. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 700 million shares. And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions"

I think I basically had very little to do with the performance of the organization in this last quarter. I give the credit just to the volume, the profitability came from the volume leverage that came in very stronger than frankly we expected. I think that the big area of opportunity, and we'll talk more about this in January, is we haven't inordinate amount of complexity in this company. Complexity and redundancy as we've basically grown through acquisitions that we didn't integrate, assimilate and has made us unwieldy in terms of complexity, as I've said and extra costs. And we're not leveraging our size and scale. So I think we'll talk about that more in January and I want to answer the second question too, because I made the decision that we needed to invest more money to put out -- to deal with some legitimate and real customer issues and challenges we have supporting our customers. We have been reducing costs in areas that were hurting our position with customers and I decided to turn that around. And no matter where we come out in January, these are strategy independent decisions to do a better job of serving our existing customers and start earning some of the goodwill back that we've been eroding over the last period of time. And so I will more than fund for this investment as a result of things we're going to announced in January. So that was my decision to stem the bleeding, frankly, in terms of how we were delivering. A big part of it is technical support because we can't grow if we don't do better job supporting our existing customers with our existing products. And so that's what the big investment is and it's the right thing for our company to do."

And unfortunately, we've been actually managing it, in my opinion, as a declining asset. So we're thinking now about what would happen if we managed it is an asset that could really help solve important customer problems and focus on it as resources to help us drive accelerated growth, solving new customer problems? While I say that, I mean we've been selling with a general salesforce which, I think, may not be the accurate go-to-market strategy given that this is a million-dollar-plus architecture-driven decision. So I think we could execute a lot better and while I say that, we're still looking at all of the strategic options but we've never played in the last few years. Our A game in this business using this as, as not necessarily a product but as a set of assets that we could deploy to solve important customer problems and grow faster. So we're going to compare that strategy against strategy of inorganic options and see how that fits. So hopefully, that sheds some light on my latest thinking which is in line with your question."

And I think the discussion we've had, number one is we've had no roots, there's been no reductions in force of any size to make these numbers. What we're doing is we're being prudent about what reinvesting in anticipation of the January announcement. And I think this has just been kind of a smart way to approach the transition between the time I started and what we announced in January. So there's been no master plan other than be thoughtful about the decisions we make every day."

I think that's a decision that would not have been made in the past but I know it's the right decision.

He will make a few opening remarks, then James will provide quarterly highlights and review our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance and assumptions. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website as well. Today's prepared remarks will be posted on the IR site after the call is completed.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates.
For the September 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.25 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.29 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.23 per euro. These compared to the September 2011 quarter, where the actual weighted average rate was $1.41 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary of actual and currency-adjusted growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information which are available on the IR website.
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on the IR website.
And now I'll turn it over to our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

When a company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to rep",785,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When a company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to report that the team stepped up during this transition. While working on our plan to change and improve the company for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders, we executed well in the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results. While the team focused on delivering in the current quarter, we are also working on creating value over a longer term time horizon.
Starting with a clean sheet of paper, the team is hard at work developing a strategy and operational plan that will help us deliver even more value for our customers and partners. So we went in the market and improved our financial performance. Our goal is to deliver a strategy and plan that will consistently deliver greater than 5% organic growth and 30% operating margins within the next 2 to 3 years. At this point, we believe we will reach sustained greater than 30% operating margins faster than 5% sustained organic growth. This plan will be one that both the leadership team and the board believe we can deliver against in the short and long term.
In the meantime, we are also -- we also continue to evaluate all of our strategic alternatives to create shareholder value and believe we are on track to share our new strategic direction and operational plan in late January of 2013. We are moving to quickly change so we can continue to improve our performance on a global basis. With more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., we can no longer operate like a U.S.-based company with global distribution.
As you can see from our recent history, our growth rates are higher outside the U.S. Our head of worldwide sales will be leaving the company. To better position us to win globally, we've decided to elevate the geo leadership roles and have them report directly to me. This move expands the scope of our regional leaders, making them ambassadors and general managers of their geographies. While their primary focus will be sales in their geographies, they will also play an expanded Symantec leadership role. We believe this will allow us to accelerate our pace of change and make better and faster decisions so we perform at a higher level on both a global and local basis.
I'd like to spend a moment on our guidance for the December quarter. We're pleased that revenue and deferred revenue continue to grow year-over-year and sequentially, especially in this uncertain global economic environment. However, operating margin is lower in the December quarter than either the September or year ago December quarters. This may seem counter to what I told you in September, that we would self-fund investments without reducing operating margin. And that's still my commitment.
After our January announcement, we will self-fund this and future investments without reducing operating margin. But we need to make these investments now and not wait until after the January announcement to set the foundation for longer term organic growth. The investments will be allocated to areas like technical support, so we better serve our customers and partners. This is the right thing to do to create long term shareholder value, no matter where we come out on our strategy and operational plan announcement in late January.
Over the past 90 days, I met with front-line employees, customers and partners, industry experts and shareholders all around the world. Our customer is saying what you probably already know. They want us and need us to become better and to win, but think we're getting in our own way. We must become more customer and partner solutions focused rather than product-specific. We must move faster to solve their future versus their past problems. And we must become easier to do business with and less fragmented as a company to become a better and stronger partner.
I've been positively surprised by the amount of unmet and underserved needs customers have in this challenging and fast-moving security and information management market. And while I still have a lot to learn, I can say with confidence that there are plenty of big opportunities for Symantec. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need to think and act differently, both strategically and operationally in ways that leverage all of our significant assets to better solve our customer's most important problems. And that's what the January announcement will be all about.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our quarterly results."

We posted better-than-expected second quarter results with record September revenue and deferred revenue, as well as strong operating margins and EPS. These results drove our organic constant currency revenue growth to 3% for the September quarter year-over-year. GAAP revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion, driven by strengthen in our Security and Information Management businesses. Our hosted archiving acquisition of LiveOffice contributed $10 million in revenue, which was better than expected. Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, content, maintenance and subscription revenue grew 7%, while license revenue declined 9%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and SaaS offerings grew 10% and accounted for 45% of total revenue as compared to 42% of revenue in the year ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year ago period.
We recorded a strong quarter in our Consumer business despite the challenges we've seen across the PC industry. The Consumer business grew 3% year-over-year to $528 million and generated its 16th consecutive quarter of growth. These results were driven by up-selling customers to our premium suites at improved pricing and growing our emerging backup, NortonLive Services and mobile businesses.
Our Consumer business is ready for the release of Windows 8. In third-party testing, Windows 8 ran 50% faster and 20% safer when paired with our new Norton solutions versus machines running the Windows Defender alternative. PCs with pre-installed Norton trialware will begin shipping with the Windows 8 launch on October 26.
Moving on to the Enterprise. The Storage and Server Management segment, which consists of our Information Management and Storage and Availability Management businesses grew 2% and generated revenue of $595 million. Revenue from the Information Management business increased 2% year-over-year, driven by NetBackup and appliances, but offset by weakness in our Backup Exec product. Sales of our backup appliances continued their momentum as we expanded our footprint across more geographies. Customers continue to be attracted to our integrated backup and deduplication offering, which is proving to be an easier to deploy solution with a lower total cost of ownership.
We are also seeing good traction building for our Backup Exec Appliance which was just launched last quarter. We continue to work through our Backup Exec software challenges. We are focusing on restoring some of the functions and performance characteristics that were available with the older versions of the product. We are making progress, but there is more work to do. Revenue in our Storage and Availability Management business increased 1% year-over-year as we see customers continuing to deploy more mission-critical applications on Linux and virtualized infrastructures. Headwinds from the decline in our customer's usage of the Solaris platform are being offset by increased penetration in both the Linux and Windows platforms. This business continues to be highly profitable, generating strong cash flow for the company.
The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year and generated revenue of $512 million, driven by double-digit growth in all of our emerging security businesses, and our continued leadership in Endpoint Protection. In particular, SEP 12 continued its success in the large Enterprise segment. This was particularly true in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, where we won several competitive tenders with large governments and corporations.
Data Loss Prevention was one of our security businesses that recorded double-digit growth. EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan, both geographies that have traditionally been slower to adopt DLP are now seeing an uptick in demand for our solution, as demonstrated by several large financial services wins. Our Trust Services business continues to perform well, in part because SSL authentication is now being used to protect all interactions with many corporate websites, not just those web pages involving monetary transactions.
Our Services business grew 7% year-over-year to $64 million in revenue.
Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 80 basis points to 84.6%. Given the higher cost of goods sold associated with these businesses, we expect this gross margin trend to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin grew 250 basis points year-over-year to 27.5%. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenue and lower spending across the company.
Net income of $322 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45. Improved operating leverage from better-than-projected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.04. Lower-than-forecasted PC OEM fees accounted for $0.01 per share of improvement and tighter spending across the company accounted for approximately $0.02 of benefit to EPS.
Continued growth in our subscriptions and maintenance businesses drove deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.62 billion. We exited the September quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments driven, in part, by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14.
As we exited the September quarter, approximately 42% of our cash balance resided in the U.S. which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from the June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 23% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $200 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 12.1 million shares at an average price of $16.48. Symantec has $483 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.
Cash flow from operating activities was lower year-over-year, driven by higher tax and severance payments, as well as lower previous quarter billings which, in turn, impacted September quarter cash collections. Foreign currency movements also negatively impacted operating cash flow by $18 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $178 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2012 quarter. We expect GAAP revenue for the December 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion, flat to up 2% on an as-reported basis, and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 73% or $1.27 billion of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.17 and $0.19 as compared to $0.32 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.38 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period. EPS is projected to be lower due to our decision to spend more in the coming quarter in areas that will better serve our customers' needs.
In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our interest expense is higher by approximately $0.01 due to our recent debt offering, and we're expecting another $0.02 impact driven by a higher tax rate, foreign exchange movements, and the liquidation of certain accounting entities as we work to further simplify our operating structure. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.765 billion and $3.825 billion, up 3% to 4% on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.35 and the end-of-period rate of $1.30 per euro in the December 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 4% from our weighted average rate in the year ago period. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 700 million shares.
And now I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

I think I basically had very little to do with the performance of the organization in this last quarter. I give the credit just to the volume, the profitability came from the volume leverage that came in very stronger than frankly we expected. I think that the big area of opportunity, and we'll talk more about this in January, is we have an inordinate amount of complexity in this company. Complexity and redundancy as we've basically grown through acquisition that we didn't integrate and assimilate and has made us unwieldy in terms of complexity, as I've said, and extra costs. And we're not leveraging our size and scale. So I think we'll talk about that more in January, and I want to answer the second question too, because I made the decision that we needed to invest more money to put out -- to deal with some legitimate and real customer issues and challenges we have supporting our customers. We have been reducing costs in areas that were hurting our position with customers, and I decided to turn that around. And no matter where we come out in January, these are strategy-independent decisions to do a better job of serving our existing customers and start earning some of the goodwill back that we've been eroding over the last period of time. And so I will more than fund for this investment as a result of things we're going to announced in January. So that was my decision to stem the bleeding, frankly, in terms of how we were delivering. A big part of it is technical support because we can't grow if we don't do a better job supporting our existing customers with our existing products. And so that's what the big investment is, and it's the right thing for our company to do."

And unfortunately, we've been actually managing it, in my opinion, as a declining asset. So we're thinking now about what would happen if we managed it is an asset that could really help solve important customer problems and focused on it these resources to help us drive accelerated growth, solving new customer problems. Now while I say that, I mean, we've been selling SAMG with a generalist sales force which, I think, may not be the accurate go-to-market strategy given that this is a million-dollar-plus architecture-driven decision. So I think we could execute a lot better, and why I say that, we're still looking at all of the strategic options, but we've never played in the last few years our A game in this business. Using this as, as not necessarily a product, but as a set of assets that we could deploy to solve important customer problems and grow faster. So we're going to compare that strategy against the strategy of inorganic options and see how that fits. So hopefully, that shed some light on my latest thinking which is in line with your question."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates.
For the September 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.25 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.29 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.23 per euro. These compared to the September 2011 quarter, where the actual weighted average rate was $1.41 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary of actual and currency-adjusted growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information which are available on the IR website.
Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on the IR website.
And now I'll turn it over to our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett."

When a company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to rep",785,"Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When a company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to report that the team stepped up during this transition. While working on our plan to change and improve the company for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders, we executed well in the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results. While the team focused on delivering in the current quarter, we are also working on creating value over a longer term time horizon.
Starting with a clean sheet of paper, the team is hard at work developing a strategy and operational plan that will help us deliver even more value for our customers and partners. So we win in the market and improve our financial performance. Our goal is to deliver a strategy and plan that will consistently deliver greater than 5% organic growth and 30% operating margins within the next 2 to 3 years. At this point, we believe we will reach sustained greater than 30% operating margins faster than 5% sustained organic growth. This plan will be one that both the leadership team and the board believe we can deliver against in the short and long term.
In the meantime, we are also -- we also continue to evaluate all of our strategic alternatives to create shareholder value and believe we are on track to share our new strategic direction and operational plan in late January of 2013. We are moving to quickly change so we can continue to improve our performance on a global basis. With more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., we can no longer operate like a U.S.-based company with global distribution.
As you can see from our recent history, our growth rates are higher outside the U.S. Our head of worldwide sales will be leaving the company. To better position us to win globally, we've decided to elevate the geo leadership roles and have them report directly to me. This move expands the scope of our regional leaders, making them ambassadors and general managers of their geographies. While their primary focus will be sales in their geographies, they will also play an expanded Symantec leadership role. We believe this will allow us to accelerate our pace of change and make better and faster decisions so we perform at a higher level on both a global and local basis.
I'd like to spend a moment on our guidance for the December quarter. We're pleased that revenue and deferred revenue continue to grow year-over-year and sequentially, especially in this uncertain global economic environment. However, operating margin is lower in the December quarter than either the September or year ago December quarters. This may seem counter to what I told you in September, that we would self-fund investments without reducing operating margin. And that's still my commitment.
After our January announcement, we will self-fund this and future investments without reducing operating margin. But we need to make these investments now and not wait until after the January announcement to set the foundation for longer term organic growth. The investments will be allocated to areas like technical support, so we better serve our customers and partners. This is the right thing to do to create long term shareholder value, no matter where we come out on our strategy and operational plan announcement in late January.
Over the past 90 days, I met with front-line employees, customers and partners, industry experts and shareholders all around the world. Our customer is saying what you probably already know. They want us and need us to become better and to win, but think we're getting in our own way. We must become more customer and partner solutions focused rather than product-specific. We must move faster to solve their future versus their past problems. And we must become easier to do business with and less fragmented as a company to become a better and stronger partner.
I've been positively surprised by the amount of unmet and underserved needs customers have in this challenging and fast-moving security and information management market. And while I still have a lot to learn, I can say with confidence that there are plenty of big opportunities for Symantec. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need to think and act differently, both strategically and operationally in ways that leverage all of our significant assets to better solve our customers' most important problems. And that's what the January announcement will be all about.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our quarterly results."
35000,222385649,369585,"Symantec Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. We posted better-than-expected second quarter results with record September revenue and deferred revenue, as well as strong operating margins and EPS. These results drove our organic constant currency revenue growth t",1282,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. We posted better-than-expected second quarter results with record September revenue and deferred revenue, as well as strong operating margins and EPS. These results drove our organic constant currency revenue growth to 3% for the September quarter year-over-year. GAAP revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion, driven by strengthen in our Security and Information Management businesses. Our hosted archiving acquisition of LiveOffice contributed $10 million in revenue, which was better than expected. Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, content, maintenance and subscription revenue grew 7%, while license revenue declined 9%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and SaaS offerings grew 10% and accounted for 45% of total revenue as compared to 42% of revenue in the year ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year ago period.
We recorded a strong quarter in our Consumer business despite the challenges we've seen across the PC industry. The Consumer business grew 3% year-over-year to $528 million and generated its 16th consecutive quarter of growth. These results were driven by up-selling customers to our premium suites at improved pricing and growing our emerging backup, NortonLive Services and mobile businesses.
Our Consumer business is ready for the release of Windows 8. In third-party testing, Windows 8 ran 50% faster and 20% safer when paired with our new Norton solutions versus machines running the Windows Defender alternative. PCs with pre-installed Norton trialware will begin shipping with the Windows 8 launch on October 26.
Moving on to the Enterprise. The Storage and Server Management segment, which consists of our Information Management and Storage and Availability Management businesses grew 2% and generated revenue of $595 million. Revenue from the Information Management business increased 2% year-over-year, driven by NetBackup and appliances, but offset by weakness in our Backup Exec product. Sales of our backup appliances continued their momentum as we expanded our footprint across more geographies. Customers continue to be attracted to our integrated backup and deduplication offering, which is proving to be an easier to deploy solution with a lower total cost of ownership.
We are also seeing good traction building for our Backup Exec Appliance which was just launched last quarter. We continue to work through our Backup Exec software challenges. We are focusing on restoring some of the functions and performance characteristics that were available with the older versions of the product. We are making progress, but there is more work to do. Revenue in our Storage and Availability Management business increased 1% year-over-year as we see customers continuing to deploy more mission-critical applications on Linux and virtualized infrastructures. Headwinds from the decline in our customers' usage of the Solaris platform are being offset by increased penetration in both the Linux and Windows platforms. This business continues to be highly profitable, generating strong cash flow for the company.
The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year and generated revenue of $512 million, driven by double-digit growth in all of our emerging security businesses, and our continued leadership in Endpoint Protection. In particular, SEP 12 continued its success in the large Enterprise segment. This was particularly true in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, where we won several competitive tenders with large governments and corporations.
Data Loss Prevention was one of our security businesses that recorded double-digit growth. EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan, both geographies that have traditionally been slower to adopt DLP are now seeing an uptick in demand for our solution, as demonstrated by several large financial services wins. Our Trust Services business continues to perform well, in part because SSL authentication is now being used to protect all interactions with many corporate websites, not just those web pages involving monetary transactions.
Our Services business grew 7% year-over-year to $64 million in revenue.
Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 80 basis points to 84.6%. Given the higher cost of goods sold associated with these businesses, we expect this gross margin trend to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin grew 250 basis points year-over-year to 27.5%. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenue and lower spending across the company.
Net income of $322 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45. Improved operating leverage from better-than-projected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.04. Lower-than-forecasted PC OEM fees accounted for $0.01 per share of improvement and tighter spending across the company accounted for approximately $0.02 of benefit to EPS.
Continued growth in our subscriptions and maintenance businesses drove deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.62 billion. We exited the September quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments driven, in part, by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14.
As we exited the September quarter, approximately 42% of our cash balance resided in the U.S. which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from the June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 23% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $200 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 12.1 million shares at an average price of $16.48. Symantec has $483 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.
Cash flow from operating activities was lower year-over-year, driven by higher tax and severance payments, as well as lower previous quarter billings which, in turn, impacted September quarter cash collections. Foreign currency movements also negatively impacted operating cash flow by $18 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $178 million.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2012 quarter. We expect GAAP revenue for the December 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion, flat to up 2% on an as-reported basis, and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 73% or $1.27 billion of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.17 and $0.19 as compared to $0.32 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.38 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period. EPS is projected to be lower due to our decision to spend more in the coming quarter in areas that will better serve our customers' needs.
In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our interest expense is higher by approximately $0.01 due to our recent debt offering, and we're expecting another $0.02 impact driven by a higher tax rate, foreign exchange movements, and the liquidation of certain accounting entities as we work to further simplify our operating structure. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.765 billion and $3.825 billion, up 3% to 4% on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.35 and the end-of-period rate of $1.30 per euro in the December 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 4% from our weighted average rate in the year ago period. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 700 million shares.
And now I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions."

I think I basically had very little to do with the performance of the organization in this last quarter. I give the credit just to the volume, the profitability that came from the volume leverage that came in very stronger than frankly we expected. I think that the big area of opportunity, and we'll talk more about this in January, is we have an inordinate amount of complexity in this company. Complexity and redundancy as we've basically grown through acquisition that we didn't integrate and assimilate and has made us unwieldy in terms of complexity, as I've said, and extra costs. And we're not leveraging our size and scale. So I think we'll talk about that more in January, and I want to answer the second question too, because I made the decision that we needed to invest more money to put out -- to deal with some legitimate and real customer issues and challenges we have supporting our customers. We have been reducing costs in areas that were hurting our position with customers, and I decided to turn that around. And no matter where we come out in January, these are strategy-independent decisions to do a better job of serving our existing customers and start earning some of the goodwill back that we've been eroding over the last period of time. And so I will more than fund for this investment after -- as a result of things we're going to announce in January. So that was my decision to stem the bleeding, frankly, in terms of how we were delivering. A big part of it is technical support because we can't grow if we don't have -- if we don't do a better job supporting our existing customers with our existing products. And so that's what the big investment is, and it's the right thing for our company to do."

And unfortunately, we've been actually managing it, in my opinion, as a declining asset. So we're thinking now about what would happen if we managed it is an asset that could really help solve important customer problems and focused on it as resources to help us drive accelerated growth, solving new customer problems. Now while I say that, I mean, we've been selling SAMG with a generalist sales force which, I think, may not be the accurate go-to-market strategy given that this is a million-dollar-plus architecture-driven decision. So I think we could execute a lot better, and why I say that, we're still looking at all of the strategic options. But we've never played, in the last few years, our A game in this business using this as, as not necessarily a product, but as a set of assets that we could deploy to solve important customer problems and grow faster. So we're going to compare that strategy against the strategy of inorganic options and see how that fits. So hopefully, that sheds some light on my latest thinking which is in line with your question."

I think that would be a big change from what we performed in the last few years. And so I would say that my focus at this point, as I said at the Citi Conference in New York is, 5% sustained organic revenue growth. Depending on how you define the markets, that's probably still share loss. But in the next 2 to 3 years, if we can deliver a plan and execute against a plan to deliver 5% or more organic growth, that would be a big positive statement. But that wouldn't be ultimately my end goal. So I think let's stay tuned for the details on that. I mean, you ultimately will have to be the ones to decide whether we'll become a share gainer or not. My short-term metric defined is 2 to 3 years is 5% sustained organic growth."

I'm actually thrilled with how this team performed in this transition. It performed better than I thought. I think I am the one that made these hard decisions to sacrifice short-term profitability to invest in doing the right thing for the long term. I know that's the right thing for our company. I know it will yield benefits long term. And you got my commitment that I will fund that through the things I'm going to announce in January. So you understand based on my track record how sensitive I am to margin expansion and margin rate improvement, I just needed to make this decision now to keep our customer service at a level that I'll be proud of, as opposed to embarrassed about. And that's one of the advantages when you travel around the world and talk to your employees and customers. You don't grow if you're not delivering for customers, and we have not been doing as good a job as we needed to do, and that's why I'm spending more money here. Strategy independent, which I will fund through the January announcement. So that's my big message. I could have taken the short term and delivered more EPS. That would not have been the right thing to do to create long-term value. And so that's why we made the decision that we made. I think that's a decision that would not have been made in the past, but I know it's the right decision. So thanks for all your support, and I look forward to a much more robust decision or discussion in January after we announce both our new strategy and operating plan. Appreciate your support. Thank you."
