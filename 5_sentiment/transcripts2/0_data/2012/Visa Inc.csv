And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Following that, I'll walk through our progress with growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments in innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams. 
Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectation during the first quarter and encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross-border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011. 
Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe. 
Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say that the dust is still settling. 
Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens. 
As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the breadth of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. 
We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. 
Looking ahead, our Board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States. 
Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court system, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues. After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion. 
Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. Now let's turn to the business update. 
During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding the acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology. 
Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event. 
That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we've always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. But the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. 
The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact driven by slower growth in transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards. 
While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment. 
To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies to issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we are poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter. 
At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships and in fact have extended for majority of those major relationships 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offered greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our Signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter. 
On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transactions costs. 
As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. 
As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully. 
Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the 8th consecutive quarter of positive growth and 3rd consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, our credit in the United States postal particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters. 
The key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of, brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term. 
Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in the 2 of the fastest-growing segments of the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefits program. 
For example, we expanded our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C.  Department of Employment Services, recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards. 
In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of the states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid card. Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide. 
Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies boasted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenue from International businesses by 2015. 
Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country. 
Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Raji Bank covering around 50% of all payments volume in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product. 
We are also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with the footprint and technical expertise in emerging economy. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. 
An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally operable electronic payment account. MTM group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTM mobile money customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country. 
And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose reloadable and travel products. We also want to mandate with AM ZED for a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up 10 different currencies on a single card at, exchange rates giving the cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with AM ZED helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide. 
Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest to new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. 
In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at the point-of-sale, with a card or phone or by digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service with global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization. 
And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and touch-to-buy functionalities including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs. 
So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require a buy in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource Gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners. 
At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers who were showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters. 
We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS that monetize global applications and immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account. These could be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community. 
Immediately available services include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. We have plans to deploy additional offerings including mobile check deposit, NEC payments, global offers and support for V.me. 
We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the world, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping and our acquisitions of CyberSource have placed them favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled $1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago. 
We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, Autotrader.com and Shutter Play. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction. 
For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99 Bill, one of that country's leading electronic payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country. 
99 Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager and was using CyberSource services to complement their existing security system to process cross-border transactions safely as they expand business overseas. 
So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the feature. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?"
38043467,145924332,217780,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and callouts.

I'll begin with some overall observations and callouts. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 10%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years. 
Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16%, below our full year guidance as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of fuel activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter. 
Fourth, note that we are recording the quarter using a 36% tax rate above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin recording at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. 
Finally, 5th, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation but will have a full effect for the balance of the year. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our Global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently enacted debt rules. 
Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rate in both debit and credit. More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%, credit growth was 10% while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. 
Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter with the U.S. growing 11% and the Rest of World 14%. The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track. In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and Rest of World to 17%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule. 
For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. Now turning to the income statement. 
Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year driven by strong growth in Global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive. 
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. Moving to the individual revenue line item. 
Service revenue is $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. 
On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth which approximated 24% for the quarter. 
International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustment outside the United States. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investment and our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp up in investment spending and marketing associated with the summer Olympic. 
Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from the lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results retroactive to 1, thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range. 
As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million share effective December 29. 
At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter. 
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned in the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan. 
Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter. 
As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. Global and Global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

I think that most of them have made their decision. There is no other major issuer that has Interlink on the back of the card that's contemplating taking it off. And we have had several wins on putting mark on the back of non-Visa debit cards and that will manifest itself certainly no later than April 1 but I can't really talk about it.

I would say out of our largest merchants there are a significant number of them that have signed contracts with us that anticipate the fixed fee. And they're fine with it. I mean I supposed that doesn't mean that they won't complain about it later but that's kind of the history of our business. As it relates to that, we're officially will put out the classifications for that in about the next week. As it relates to fully activating the PIN capability on the Visa debit card, that would begin on April 1. And all of those things are going along as we anticipated as we had planned. We're very happy with the way that it turned out. And as you might expect, I mean there's been a lot and a lot of it has gone under the bridge. They're both obligated paradigms. As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases.

And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell looking at the volumes exactly what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course, you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. I obviously, issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other.

First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012.
Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams.
Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011.
Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. 
We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe.
Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling.
Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. 
Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens.
As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders.
We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan.
Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. 
Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States.  Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's systems, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues.  After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion.
Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. 
Now let's turn to the business update.  During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding the acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology.
Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. 
In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event.
That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. 
The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. 
A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards.
While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment.
To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter.
At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter.
On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. 
Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. 
As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. 
Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully.
Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters.
The key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of code brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term.
Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs. 
For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards.
In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid card. 
Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide.
Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment of volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015.
Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. 
In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product.
We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economy. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. 
An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. 
Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country.
And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products.
We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide.
Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients.
In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or by digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization.  And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. 
As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs.
So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be extending the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require a buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. 
To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners.
At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.
We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, that monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community.
Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me.
We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago.
We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction.
For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country.
99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas.
So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. 
Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?"
38043467,145924332,217891,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of wo",1187,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years.
Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of fee activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter.
Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. 
Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.
Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently enacted debit rules.
Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit. 
More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.
Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%. 
The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track.  In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule.
For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. 
Now turning to the income statement.  Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive.
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item.  Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.
On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter.
International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustment outside the United States.
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. 
Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range.
As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million share effective December 29.
At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter.
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan.
Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter.
As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

And then the rate of deal activity, which has nothing to do with Durbin, but has to do with the ongoing course of our business, primarily credit, both in the United States and outside the United States, that level of deal activity was just less than we anticipated in the first quarter. And so that will just carry forward into quarters 2, 3 and 4. So we are -- we reaffirmed our guidance as 17% to 18%. We still feel good about that. No real call-outs, just timing."

As it relates to activate -- fully activating the PIN capability on the Visa debit card, that would begin on April 1. And all of those things are going along as we anticipated, as we had planned. We're very happy with the way that it turned out. And as you might expect, I mean there's been a lot of water that's gone under the bridge. They're both complicated paradigms. As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases. As we speak today, as it relates to the PIN capability on the signature card, that seems to be the way things are moving.

And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other. But I think it's pretty clear that you're going to see strong credit card growth at least from Visa in the foreseeable future."

And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012.
Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams.
Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011.
Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. 
We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe.
Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling.
Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. 
Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens.
As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders.
We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan.
Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. 
Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States.  Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's assistance, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues.  After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion.
Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. 
Now let's turn to the business update.  During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology.
Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. 
In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event.
That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. 
The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. 
A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards.
While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment.
To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter.
At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter.
On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. 
Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. 
As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. 
Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully.
Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters.
A key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of co-brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term.
Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs. 
For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards.
In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid cards. 
Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide.
Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015.
Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. 
In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product.
We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economies. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. 
An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally inter-operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. 
Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country.
And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products.
We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up to 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide.
Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients.
In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or buying digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization.  And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. 
As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs.
So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. 
To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners.
At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.
We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, and monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account holders. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community.
Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me.
We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago.
We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction.
For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country.
99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas.
So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. 
Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?"
38043467,145924332,218002,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of wo",1187,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years.
Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of deal activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter.
Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. 
Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.
Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently-enacted bed [ph] rules.
Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit. 
More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.
Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%. 
The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track.  In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule.
For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. 
Now turning to the income statement.  Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive.
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item.  Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.
On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter.
International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States.
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. 
Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range.
As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million shares effective December 29.
At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter.
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan.
Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter.
As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

And so the guidance adjustments are more a function of having a portion of our year with a clear line of sight.

And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other.

And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012.
Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams.
Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011.
Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. 
We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe.
Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling.
Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. 
Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens.
As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders.
We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan.
Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. 
Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States.  Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's assistance, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues.  After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion.
Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. 
Now let's turn to the business update.  During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology.
Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. 
In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event.
That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. 
The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. 
A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards.
While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment.
To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter.
At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter.
On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. 
Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. 
As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. 
Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully.
Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters.
A key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of co-brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term.
Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs. 
For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards.
In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid cards. 
Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide.
Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015.
Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. 
In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.
Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product.
We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economies. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. 
An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally inter-operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. 
Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country.
And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products.
We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up to 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide.
Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients.
In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or buying digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization.  And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. 
As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs.
So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. 
To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners.
At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.
We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, and monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account holders. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community.
Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me.
We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago.
We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction.
For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country.
99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas.
So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. 
Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?"
38043467,145924332,219103,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of wo",1187,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years.
Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of deal activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter.
Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. 
Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.
Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently-enacted bed [ph] rules.
Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit. 
More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.
Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%. 
The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track.  In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule.
For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. 
Now turning to the income statement.  Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive.
The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item.  Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.
On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter.
International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States.
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. 
Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range.
As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million shares effective December 29.
At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter.
Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan.
Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter.
As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

Recognizing that we have a one quarter lag on our service fees, that means we've already got a line of sight into 7 months of that revenue. Cross border volumes have held up very well. With regards to both the U.S. and the global economy, both have demonstrated sustained momentum. The exciting drama unfolding in Europe has yet to really play out on the volumes. And so the guidance adjustments are more a function of having a portion of our year with a clear line of sight.

It doesn't have anything to do with our pricing. It's much more a function of currency volatility, and that has largely been courtesy of Europe and the unfolding drama around the euro. With regards to -- let me see if I understand the question. On balance in U.S. debit, when you combine the fixed acquiring network fee with the lower variable transaction fees associated with U.S. debit, this constitutes a net price reduction.

As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases. As we speak today, as it relates to the PIN capability on the signature cards, that seems to be the way things are moving. It's a capability that we have, and we're very comfortable with that as well."

And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other. But I think it's pretty clear that you're going to see strong credit card growth at least from Visa in the foreseeable future."

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross border activity. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period of last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. 
Visa's Global business continues to expand at a healthy pace, a strong March followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. 
In the U.S. payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer offer fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2013 and beyond. 
From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3 quarters of our U.S. red volume secured into the 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success winning important new credit business for multiple U.S. issuers. 
On the card brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit cobranded partnership with Alaska Airlines, importantly the benefits from a large number of affluent card holders and a high cross border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under Mileage Plus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued Mileage Plus cards. 
As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no signature required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available through the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. 
Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. with the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. 
So far, the situation is playing out as we expected and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth, and as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. 
To really understand what's happening in our debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, the Visa debit and Interlink, independently. Visa debit also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest albeit slowing payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. 
Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind though that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue, and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. 
We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes in recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. 
For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitors brand. More importantly, our comprehensive integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. 
On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that goal until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority expanding beyond that. 
As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. 
Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working, and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for the healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. 
On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN authenticated Visa debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we have now look at that department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and our response to the DOJ supports that. But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. 
Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007. Each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the Department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. 
So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we plan for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013 take everything I discussed into account. 
Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I've said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily extending Visa's International business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. 
Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant-dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. 
With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. 
This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals; ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa and just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. 
At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these expanding regions. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions and CyberSource, and Fundamo are paying off, and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. 
This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to expand Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. 
Vodafone, the second-largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. 
Orange Telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East of Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Nearfield communication technology. 
Our previously announced agreement to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isys are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. 
Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter included an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new LUMIA smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. 
To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we've executed a deal with Arbiter Technologies to rollout Visa's Mobile Provisioning Service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. 
It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource. And I'm pleased to say that quarter-after-quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. 
At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by coselling Visa processing and services CyberSource Merchant, gateway and fraud services. 
For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and Direct Connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, CELO, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. 
These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visas's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we're providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. 
Together, Fundamo and CyberSource, build the commerce for a simple account, checkout and authorization process. 
I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance market, and another example of how we're applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. 
A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways in places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and rewards. 
It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations. And we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. 
This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reputenantsbuy.com. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. 
Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers. And we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and our engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. 
In parallel, we need to bring in additional merchants on board. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants on board to hold the full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda and flawless execution would be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. 
And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in was both highly competitive and dynamic. We remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. 
Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,183961569,295537,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax lia",1359,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. 
We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. 
Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. Second, Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad-based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in rest of world. Third, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. 
Fourth, as expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth built modestly positive for the March quarter will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes primarily on Interlink volumes picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. 
Fifth, client incentives for the quarter. As a percent of gross revenue was 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as the U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. 
Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. 
As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate at this point in time growth in the high teens. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. 
Several call-outs. First, credit in both the U.S. and rest of world picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1. Second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1. Third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. 
More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. 
While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning of the year projections. Global cross border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appear solid. Through April 28, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with the U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. 
Four call-outs. First, Visa processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rate for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. Second, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. Third, given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning of year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. 
Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volumes with midteen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. 
Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. 
Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect as second half ramp up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter given an expected ramp up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for our full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. 
Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. 
At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. 
Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But it's also removing payment volume for which there are no service fees. So that will actually boost the service fee yield on the transactions that remain.

But our expectation at that point in our guidance at that time on 2012 was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we begin to in effect outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we want to make it clear that when we talk about 2013, our expectation was more high teens recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or impossible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS. And that we would be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that we wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven b",2690,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you for joining us today. 
Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. 
Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. 
Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. 
In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3 quarters of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers. 
On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio [ph] of the benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards. 
As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available through the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. 
Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. 
So far, the situation is playing out, as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. 
To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. 
Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month over the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes in recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. 
Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. 
For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. 
On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that. 
As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. 
Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. 
On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we've met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that. 
But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. 
So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account. 
Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. 
Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. 
With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. 
We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. 
This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. 
At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. 
This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. 
Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. 
At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. 
Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. 
To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. 
It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. 
At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing and services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services. 
For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. 
These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visas's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource, fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process. 
I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance market, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. 
A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. 
It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. 
Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. 
This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. 
On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. 
In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. 
And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. 
Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,183961569,295710,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax l",1346,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. 
First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. 
Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. 
Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World. 
Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. 
Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. 
Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. 
Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. 
Several call-outs. First, credit in both the U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. 
More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appear solid. 
Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. 
Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. 
Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. 
Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. 
Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. 
Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. 
Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this was largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. 
Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. 
At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. 
Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

One of the natural effects of pulling out Interlink transactions is since it only affects the DP line, there will be a natural drop just because it will be generating last DP fees. But it's also removing payment volume for which there are no service fees. So that will actually boost the service fee yield on the transactions that remain. And we will give some thought as to how to talk about that with you all by the next earnings call to help sort that out.

So whatever the growth rate in revenue is for 2012, everything else being equal, we would expect it to be somewhat higher in 2013. With regards to EPS growth, if you recall, back in the October earnings call when we reaffirmed the '13 guidance, what we said was we expected EPS to also grow off of 2000 levels, but our expectation at that point, and our guidance at that time on 2012, was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, to outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS. In that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13.

38043467,183961569,295842,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven b",2687,"Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you for joining us today. 
Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. 
Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. 
Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March quarter followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. 
In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3/4 of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers. 
On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards. 
As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available to the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. 
Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. 
So far, the situation is playing out as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. 
To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. 
Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes and recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. 
Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. 
For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. 
On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that. 
As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. 
Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. 
On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that. 
But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. 
So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account. 
Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. 
Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. 
With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. 
We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. 
This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. 
At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions in CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. 
This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. 
Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. 
At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. 
Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. 
To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. 
It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. 
At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services. 
For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. 
These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visa's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process. 
I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance mark, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. 
A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. 
Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. 
This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. 
On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. 
In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. 
And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. 
Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,183961569,295842,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax l",1346,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. 
First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. 
Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. 
Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World. 
Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. 
Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. 
Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. 
Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. 
Several call-outs. First, credit in both U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. 
More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears solid. 
Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. 
Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. 
Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. 
Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. 
Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. 
Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. 
Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. 
Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. 
At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. 
Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS, and  that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year.

Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. 
Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. 
With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. 
Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March quarter followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. 
In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3/4 of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers. 
On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards. 
As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available to the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. 
Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. 
So far, the situation is playing out as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. 
To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. 
Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes and recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. 
Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. 
For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. 
On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that. 
As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. 
Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. 
On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that. 
But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. 
So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account. 
Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. 
Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. 
Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. 
With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. 
We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. 
This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. 
At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions. 
On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions in CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. 
This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. 
Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. 
At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. 
Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. 
To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. 
It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. 
At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services. 
For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. 
These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. 
Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visa's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process. 
I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance mark, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. 
A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. 
Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. 
This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. 
On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. 
In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. 
And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. 
Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,183961569,295899,"Visa, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax l",1346,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. 
First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. 
Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. 
Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World. 
Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. 
Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. 
Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. 
Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. 
Several call-outs. First, credit in both U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. 
More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears solid. 
Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. 
Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. 
Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. 
Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. 
Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. 
Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. 
International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. 
Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. 
Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. 
At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. 
Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So whatever the growth rate in revenue is for 2012, everything else being equal, we would expect it to be somewhat higher in 2013. With regards to EPS growth, if you recall, back in the October earnings call when we reaffirmed the '13 guidance, what we said was we expected EPS to also grow off of 2000 levels, but our expectation at that point, and our guidance at that time on 2012, was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS, and  that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13. And so that's why we want to make very clear that, at least at this point in time, our earnings growth guidance should be in the high teens range."

We are pleased to have the opportunity to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy. Visa had another quarter of strong financial performan",2110,"Thank you, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy. 
Visa had another quarter of strong financial performance posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year. After adjusting for previously announced litigation reserve, net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.56, a 25% increase over the fiscal quarter of 2011. So with 3 strong quarters of operational performance behind us, which include insights and both the initial adverse Durbin impacts and our fiscal fourth quarter services revenues, we are now adjusting our 2012 EPS growth guidance to low 20s. And we continued to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $461 million of our excess cash to repurchase 4 million shares during the fiscal third quarter.  Looking ahead, our Board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. 
You heard this before but it's worth repeating, the shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a global trend that we expect to continue well into the future. Today, more than 30% of global consumer spending, almost $10 trillion, remains on cash and checks worldwide. Interestingly, despite Visa's success increasing penetration of electronic payments over the past several years, the total opportunity to take share from cash and checks worldwide has actually expanded since our IPO, driven primarily by global population growth and expansion of many emerging economies where electronic payments currently represent a relatively small percentage of personal consumption expenditures. 
Though we're never content just to benefit from evolving demographics. Visa is taking action to accelerate growth beyond the secular trend. To do so, we are focused on building and expanding the entire Payments category in every market that we operate. That means in our partnership -- that means in partnership with our financial institution clients, putting more payment products in more people's hands, tapping entirely new market segments with diverse product offerings, expanding the places where Visa products are accepted and innovating next-generation payment technologies that create a superior payment experience for account holders and add value to financial institutions and merchants.  And as we are successful in expanding the overall Payments category, Visa's business benefits through diversity and resiliency, which helped us continue to grow through the past economic cycles.  So while we are closely watching economic conditions that could impact Visa's business, including fallout from continued volatility in Europe and softening outlooks for both China and Brazil, our underlying business drivers remains strong. 
To begin my business review, let's first discuss the United States where credit posted yet another strong quarter with payment volumes increasing 10%, Visa's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. In addition to strengthen the overall category, I'm confident we picked up share in credit as we've added new clients and build upon Visa's strong existing client relationships. 
Turning to U.S. Debit, the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 and '13. During the June quarter, Visa's aggregate debit payment volume growth in the U.S. was negative 9% as our clients complied with the April regulatory deadlines. This was driven by the fall off of Interlink payment volumes, which came in line with our projections. Meanwhile, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, posted healthy mid-single-digit payment volume growth, which we expect to continue. 
As predicted during last quarter's call, I am confident Visa experienced the trough for U.S. debit payment volumes during the fiscal quarter. And we are now seeing signs of improved performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. That being said and as we have stated previously, we recognize that some debit share loss resulting from this regulation will be permanent. 
As for implementation of our debit strategies to compete for merchant routing and win issuer business, I will simply say I am pleased with our progress and confident in our long-term position. Our efforts remain on track, and our strategies are gaining traction. We are absolutely delivering the value we promised to our merchant and financial institution clients, and equally important, the strategies are delivering on Visa's own financial and operational expectations. 
As for the CID, the status is essentially unchanged since our last call. I remain comfortable our actions appropriate and we continue to be in regular contact with the department providing information as requested. I'll keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. 
Switching gears, I'd like to briefly provide my perspective on the proposed merchant litigation settlement announced earlier this month. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States. Importantly, our current guidance for fiscal 2012 and '13 fully takes this agreement into account. I am pleased that we have settlements after an extensive process coordinated by court-appointed mediators, which have been approved by class representatives, class counsel and the retailers who filed separate suits. We anticipate these will have support among the retail community in the U.S. because it is a fair and an appropriate compromise for all parties and that the agreement will be approved by the court.  As for the next steps, preliminary court approval of this agreement is expected in the fall and Visa is preparing to begin implementation in the early part of 2013. Bottom line, we are moving towards ending a 7-year dispute with an important constituency of our client base: merchants; and we are doing so in a reasonable and responsible way. Looking ahead, we are actively looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with the U.S. merchant community to advance our mutual agendas. In particular, we believe that investments we are making in next-generation payment technologies, V.me, mobile payments and merchant offers, will drive considerable value to merchants. 
Now let's shift the discussion to Visa's international business where we continue to focus on driving long-term growth. Breaking down our specific regions, in constant dollars, payment volumes in Asia Pacific grew 13%; Canada at 8%; whilst EMEA and Latin America posted gains of 41% and 20% respectively in the June quarter. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, a top priority is building the Payments category globally. To that end, we continue to execute a targeted investment strategy in several geographies with significant growth potential, deploying locally tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year horizon. 
So let me give you a few specific examples to demonstrate our progress. In Russia, over 80% of consumer spending is still cash-based, which presents a significant opportunity. To drive future growth, Visa is intensely focused on expanding usage in everyday spend merchant categories, including supermarkets, a strategy that aligns particularly well with our strong stable of debit cards in that country.  During the most recent quarter, Visa launched acceptance at Mutney, the largest grocery chain with more than 5,000 stores. In fact, with the addition of the Mutney, Visa now is accepted at the 4 largest food retail chains in Russia, a major step towards accelerated growth in that country. 
At the same time in the Middle East we are building on our traditionally strong position with a full within Manchuria compliant credit products, working with clients to expand debits. As one example of our success, Visa recently secured a significant multiproduct extension with the National Bank of Kuwait. 
The key element of our strategy is increased investment in local expertise and local engagement. To that end, we recently opened our first offices in Doha, in Abu Dhabi as well as a double the size of our presence in Dubai to serve clients better across the Middle East in the SEMEA region generally. And in East Africa, a region I recently visited, we are investing now to reap long-term returns. We recently opened a regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, an important opportunity in that geographies using our Fundamo platform to deploy mobile solutions and drive long-term growth. 
We are also making steady progress in Rwanda, which offers a case study of how Visa can proactively engage governments and align our own growth agenda with domestic priorities. In that regard, we are working with the Rwandan government to increase access to and usage of electronic payments in that country.  A key priority is financial inclusion and literacy using mobile technology. Additionally, Visa is now processing domestic payments and interbank ATM withdrawals, an important step forward for this emerging economy. Also, our efforts will help increase tourism volumes from international travelers, the key driver of economic activity and a top government priority. Finally, this effort should be the foundation for our activities in the entire East African region.  Expect us to talk to you more about this in the future. 
We're also making steady progress in Indonesia, a rapidly expanding economy with a growing affluent middle class and a population fast approaching 250 million. A key element of our strategy here is growing acceptance. To that end, Visa signed a multiphase, multiyear card acceptance promotion with the country's largest petrol chain, Percambina, with more than 4,000 gas stations nationwide and approximately $30 billion in sales volume annually, the promotion will help expand the acceptance of Visa credit debit cards over the next few years. Most recently, during the last quarter's CyberSource, Visa's 2010 acquisition signed a number of deals to accelerate e-commerce acceptance, including one with the national airline, Garuda, to provide payment, gateway and fraud management services. 
Meanwhile, in China, I know you are already aware of the World Trade Organization's final report containing the findings of the case between the U.S. and Chinese governments concerning China's domestic electronic payments marketplace. While we are still assessing its implications, we are hopeful that ruling ultimately could provide for more global entrants into China's payment marketplace. Although a number of additional steps still need to be taken in the WTO process before we have any clarity or certainty. Most importantly to Visa, we continue to make strategic investments to expand our existing business in China. To that end, we executed several long-term client partnerships during the quarter, including multiyear extensions with China and Banking Corporation. We also secured a new relationship with Bank of Communication. Overall, our focus is on advancing our partnership with local banks and China UnionPay to serve consumers and businesses using our existing 78 million Pro Badge cards when traveling abroad. 
In fact, earlier this week, Visa cosponsored a payment securities symposium with China UnionPay. The symposium was hosted by the payment in the Association of China. It was under the endorsement of the People's Bank of China. During this event, Alan Ritchie, our Chief Enterprise Risk Officer joined banking executives, regulators and law enforcement in Beijing to speak about Visa's role in payment security in the fast-growing Chinese market. 
And finally, we are 2 days away from the start of the 2012 Olympic Games. There's a region that Visa has been the sponsor of the Olympic games for more than a quarter of a century. No sponsorship platform offers a better opportunity to help our clients around the world grow their businesses while also driving incremental transaction revenue for Visa. Over the past 13 Olympic summer games and winter Olympic games, this sponsorship has provided Visa with the global platform to amplify our brand message among a passionate global fan base then drive tangible business results. We work with our clients to tailor their Olympic-related activities to address the unique needs of their own business and geography, including cardholder acquisition, retention or increasing usage. 
This year, I'm pleased that Visa has engaged a record number of clients in our program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions of merchants worldwide activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. This represents a 70% increase from our program in Beijing and positions us for a highly successful event over the next 2 weeks. 
So to wrap up our strong performance during the fiscal quarter demonstrates the underlying strength and resilience of Visa's business model. We continued to accelerate the migration away from cash and check to electronic payments. We helped our clients grow their core business lines. We expanded our footprint in international markets, both emerging and established. We advanced our innovation agenda. And we took significant steps to resolve credit business issues. As always, I remain highly confident in the future of the Visa. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,212665146,330849,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU and the merchants li",1578,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU and the merchants litigation and the preliminary agreement with the individual plaintiff since both of these events are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan. These accruals, which totaled $4.1 billion, resulted in a quarterly after tax loss of $1.8 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding these litigation accruals, we reported solid earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter. 
Second, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. We expect a similar if not slightly higher impact in the next few quarters as more of our debit volume is exposed to lower variable fees and incentive agreements. As we have stated before, this is already incorporated into our guidance. 
Third, foreign tax credits resulted in a benefit of $56 million or $0.08 to our adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. These tax credits were contemplated in our full year guidance, with the amount recognized in the third quarter representing the total for the year. 
Fourth, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently 10% in the quarter. Through the 21st of July, credit payment volume growth has comped at a 9% rate, consistent with a somewhat tepid but sustained U.S. economic recovery. 
Fifth, as anticipated, aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 9% growth rate in the third quarter, led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 54%. So far, the month of April has proven to be the trough in debit payment volume loss. And since then, we have seen sequential monthly progress during the quarter and recapturing portions of this Interlink volume.  Importantly, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, continued to post solid mid-single digit payment volume growth. 
Sixth, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 19%, consistent with our full-year guidance Range, which is weighted to the back half of the year. Higher incentives had 2 drivers. First, pricing adjustments linked to our U.S. debit mitigation strategies, which are expected to continue and potentially grow as our merchant and acquirer agreements take hold. And second, certain Rest of World incentives, which are not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, in late May, we received from the IRS a notice of proposed adjustment for our fiscal 2008 Federal income tax return. This notice would disallow the reduction and associated tax benefit related to payments made in 2008 toward the American Express litigation. We disagree with this proposed adjustment. We are comfortable defending our position, and importantly, we made no changes to our tax estimates relating to this deduction or any similar deductions for covered litigation in subsequent fiscal years.  Resolution of these types of tax matters generally take some time to conclude. 
Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global, payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 6%, down from the March quarter's normalized 10% after adjusting for the leap year. Several call-outs: first, combined credit growth for both the U.S. and Rest of World held steady versus a normalized prior quarter. Both produced double-digit growth; second, Rest of World debit growth was unchanged at 28%, same as the normalized second quarter rate; third, more recently through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth was flat comprised of 9% credit growth and minus 7% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a normalize to 15% rate in the second quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and the Rest of World, 16%. 
We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and SEMEA regions. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 12% with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and the Rest of World at 13%. Transactions processed over the next network totaled $13.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. A debit lead decline of 3% in the U.S. was offset by 18% growth in Rest of World. For the month of July through the 21, processed transaction growth was a positive 2%, driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.3 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. Three call-outs: First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the rules next year; second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. Card it and Rest of World; finally, although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time. 
Now turning to the income statement, net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior-year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the March quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the June quarter. Data processing revenue was $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates. For CyberSource transactions and Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S., as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective in the quarter. As a reminder, this fixed acquirer network fee initiated in the third quarter is booked to data processing revenue.  Offsetting merchant and acquirer incentives, are reflected in the contra revenue incentive line, which I'll cover in a moment. 
Turning to a different metric, we saw a step up in the gross revenue data processing yield, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the steep decline in Interlink transactions in the quarter, which are by far, our lowest yielding product. 
International transaction revenue was up 13% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with low double-digit growth rates in the U.S. and midteen growth in the Rest of World as measured on a constant dollar basis. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 19%. The fourth fiscal quarter will also see an elevated level, but is likely to be slightly less than Q3. Together, these intensive levels are consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. While we are not yet prepared to offer a more detailed view of fiscal 2013 incentives, we do expect a modest increase from the 2012 level of 17% to 18%. 
Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our investments in growth-related technology projects. Marketing expenses of $242 million reflect a heavier weighting of spend in the second half of the year timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 58%, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to 61%, consistent with our guidance of about 60% for the year. The third quarter's margin is in line with our expectation for expense timing as we realize a second ramp up incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. 
Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter and are $235 million year to date. Given our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year, we will likely come in at the lower end of that rage. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q3 was 29.2%, and as I mentioned at the outset, was positively impacted by a $56 million benefit from foreign tax credits. The amount recognized represent the total for the year. 
During the quarter, we spent $461 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $115.51 per share. Our board recently authorized a new repurchase plan totaling $1 billion, effective through July of 2013. Separate from the share repurchase program, on July 24, we added an incremental $150 million to the escrow account. The fourth quarter event were reduced the b share conversion ratio to 0.4206, thereby reducing the a equivalent share count by 1.2 million shares. 
At the end of the June quarter, we had 670 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the third quarter totaled $675 million. Finally, we are making only one adjustment to our outstanding 2012 fiscal guidance other than the minor notes I've addressed. Given where we are year-to-date, we are eliminating high teens from our EPS growth guidance and going with just low 20s. As is our custom, we plan to fully address our 2013 guidance on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So no change on that front. As a evidenced by the approval by the board to authorize a new billion dollar share repurchase program. Second, with regards to margins -- let me reframe that, last year, we delivered about a 60% operating margin. That is our guidance for this year. The lower margins that operating margins you're seeing in this quarter and we'll see again in the next quarter are all consistent with our guidance of about 60 for this year. As you may recall from our -- at the beginning of year earnings call, beginning of fiscal year, we indicated that it would be about 60 for the year but that would be a little higher in the first half of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year, largely due to a ramp-up in technology investments and awaited marketing spend for the Olympics timed with the second half. So this year, past year, about 60 and we'll let you know what '13 looks like in another quarter."

That's the extent to which we've guided to '13. And remember, when we said we expect revenues to generate, that's everything else being equal. We expect to have debit -- the U.S. debit part of the business annualized halfway in through the year. So in order -- I mean honestly, to give a much more informed perspective on revenue growth for next year, we'll wait to the fourth quarter call, at which point we'll have much better visibility of what we're looking at going in. Meanwhile, we are reconfirming the guidance that we currently have for fiscal year '13. With regards to incremental wins, you can say we have some, certainly on the credit side. We don't have -- we have the opposite, so to speak, courtesy of the U.S. government on the debit side. And so in balancing those and looking at the current underlying revenue drivers of cross border volume growth, transaction growth, inside the U.S., outside the U.S., that's really what's underpinning our guidance comments for '13, for balance of year and '13 to date.

We were, in the fourth fiscal quarter of '11, we were kind of at the upper end of mid-single digits in that category. We've remained in that range for Qs 1, 2 and 3. And if you look at Q2 on a normalized basis pulling out the leap year, the growth rates for Q2 and Q3 are identical. So I would say with the overlay of what Joe said in terms of a modest level of impact, it has been relatively sustained during this fiscal year."

So whatever impact, with the exception of 2 countries which I'll turn to in a moment, we can dampen the impact on affects.

The outlook for devaluation I would say certainly is nothing's in certainty, but at some point, it looks like we're heading to that. And you can't -- there's no economic hedge for either one of those 2 currencies. So is that a bit of a drag on our Latin America business, yes. Is it hedgeable, no. But that's baked into the numbers we reported. With regards to any other country callout, I would say Brazil has tempered a bit. There has been a tax placed on credit usage for cross-border travel, which has definitely put a bit of a break on the exuberance of the Brazilians to see the world. That tax is not applied to debit, but it is applied to credit. And so I would say overall, particularly the rest of Latin America that the business is strong. It has very, very healthy growth rates, unimpeded by shifts in currency. Average credit ticket, no substantive change in that metric for the moment. But if you'd like something more specific, I'm sure if you call our IR group, Jack or Victoria will be able to give you something more specific."

So the yield increase in the data processing category absolutely was expected. Remember a couple of things as perspective, that as part of our Durbin mitigation strategies, we implemented a fixed acquiring network fee, which is completely captured in the DP category. We also reduced variable transaction fees, which are also included in the DP category. But we then introduced a degree of incentive offset and that appears in a completely different line. So while the growth yield for DP goes up, it's not a true picture. And instead, you really ought to be looking at net yield, which I'll come back to in a minute as it relates to Visa Inc. revenue yield. With regards to the DP yield, there's one other factor involved, which has an impact on the calculation, which is our lowest yielding product is Interlink. So as -- and that has borne the brunt of the loss as we conform to the new rules. And so as Interlink moves out of the denominator in terms of yield calculation, it has the least impact on the numerator and automatically, the yield moves up. And so you have both of those indicators going forward. There are a number of factors impacting the DP line. Debit is one, including Interlink; CyberSource booked into the DP line. And so I think what it's going to take is the next 2 or 3 quarters or so in order for us to kind of reset what the base trend lines ought to be projected off of with regards to data processing. So I think -- wish I could be more helpful, but I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before this sorts out. When you put all of this together and you look at the Visa Inc. revenue yield, of which DP is an important component, but that captures the incentives, in the way that we capture and measure yield, our yield for the third fiscal quarter of '12 is actually flat with the yield we experienced in the third quarter of '11, fiscal year '11. So a lot of moving parts. This is where we are sorting out and I'm afraid is just going to take 2 or 3 quarters before we can we set the different trend lines on the different be categories."

We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy.Visa had another quarter of strong financial perf",2118,"Thank you, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy.
Visa had another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year. 
After adjusting for our previously announced litigation reserve, net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.56, a 25% increase over the fiscal quarter of 2011. 
So with 3 strong quarters of operational performance behind us, which include insights in both the initial adverse Durbin impacts and our fiscal fourth quarter services revenues, we are now adjusting our 2012 EPS growth guidance to low 20s. And we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $461 million of our excess cash to repurchase 4 million shares during the fiscal third quarter.  Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program.
You heard this before but it's worth repeating, the shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a global trend that we expect to continue well into the future. Today, more than 30% of global consumer spending, almost $10 trillion, remains on cash and checks worldwide. Interestingly, despite Visa's success in increasing penetration of electronic payments over the past several years, the total opportunity to take share from cash and checks worldwide has actually expanded since our IPO, driven primarily by global population growth and expansion of many emerging economies where electronic payments currently represent a relatively small percentage of personal consumption expenditures.
But we're never content just to benefit from evolving demographics, Visa is taking action to accelerate growth beyond the secular trend. To do so, we are focused on building and expanding the entire payments category in every market that we operate. That means in our partnership -- that means in partnership with our financial institution clients, putting more payment products in more people's hands, tapping entirely new market segments with diverse product offerings, expanding the places where Visa products are accepted and innovating next-generation payment technologies that create a superior payment experience for account holders and add value to financial institutions and merchants.  
And as we are successful in expanding the overall payments category, Visa's business benefits through diversity and resiliency, which helped us continue to grow through the past economic cycles.  So while we are closely watching economic conditions that could impact Visa's business, including fallout from continued volatility in Europe and softening outlooks for both China and Brazil, our underlying business drivers remain strong.
To begin my business review, let's first discuss the United States where credit posted yet another strong quarter, with payment volumes increasing 10%, Visa's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. 
In addition to strengthen the overall category, I'm confident we picked up share in credit as we've added new clients and build upon Visa's strong existing client relationships.
Turning to U.S. debit, the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 and '13. During the June quarter, Visa's aggregate debit payments volume growth in the U.S. was negative 9%, as our clients complied with the April regulatory deadlines. This was driven by the fall off of Interlink payment volumes, which came in line with our projections. 
Meanwhile, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, posted healthy mid single-digit payment volume growth, which we expect to continue.
As predicted during last quarter's call, I am confident Visa experienced the trough for U.S. debit payment volumes during the fiscal quarter, and we are now seeing signs of improved performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. That being said and as we have stated previously, we recognize that some debit share loss resulting from this regulation will be permanent.
As for implementation of our debit strategies to compete for merchant routing and win issuer business, I will simply say I am pleased with our progress and confident in our long-term position. Our efforts remain on track, and our strategies are gaining traction. We are absolutely delivering the value we promised to our merchant and financial institution clients, and equally important, the strategies are delivering on Visa's own financial and operational expectations.
As for the CID, the status is essentially unchanged since our last call. I remain comfortable our actions are appropriate, and we continue to be in regular contact with the department providing information as requested. I'll keep you updated if and when the situation warrants.
Switching gears, I'd like to briefly provide my perspective on the proposed merchant litigation settlement announced earlier this month. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States.  Importantly, our current guidance for fiscal 2012 and '13 fully takes this agreement into account. 
I am pleased that we have settlements after an extensive process, coordinated by court-appointed mediators, which have been approved by class representatives, class counsel and the retailers who filed separate suits. We anticipate these will have support among the retail community in the U.S. because it is a fair and an appropriate compromise for all parties, and that the agreement will be approved by the court.  
As for the next steps, preliminary court approval of this agreement is expected in the fall, and Visa is preparing to begin implementation in the early part of 2013. 
Bottom line, we are moving towards ending a 7-year dispute with an important constituency of our client base: merchants; and we are doing so in a reasonable and responsible way. Looking ahead, we are actively looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with the U.S. merchant community to advance our mutual agendas. In particular, we believe that investments we are making in next-generation payment technologies, V.me, mobile payments and merchant offers, will drive considerable value to merchants.
Now let's shift the discussion to Visa's international business where we continue to focus on driving long-term growth. Breaking down our specific regions in constant dollars, payment volumes in Asia Pacific grew 13%, Canada at 8%, whilst EMEA and Latin America posted gains of 41% and 20%, respectively, in the June quarter. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, our top priority is building the payments category globally. To that end, we continue to execute a targeted investment strategy in several geographies with significant growth potential, deploying locally tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year horizon.
So let me give you a few specific examples to demonstrate our progress. In Russia, over 80% of consumer spending is still cash-based, which presents a significant opportunity. To drive future growth, Visa is intensely focused on expanding usage in every day spend merchant categories, including supermarkets, a strategy that aligns particularly well with our strong stable of debit cards in that country.  
During the most recent quarter, Visa launched acceptance at Mutney [ph], the country's largest grocery chain, with more than 5,000 stores. In fact, with the addition of Mutney [ph], Visa now is accepted at the 4 largest food retail chains in Russia, a major step towards accelerated growth in that country. 
At the same time, in the Middle East, we are building on our traditionally strong position with affluent [indiscernible] compliant credit products, working with clients to expand debits. 
As one example of our success, Visa recently secured a significant multiproduct extension with the National Bank of Kuwait.
A key element of our strategy is increased investment in local expertise and local engagement. To that end, we recently opened our first offices in Doha, in Abu Dhabi, as well as double the size of our presence in Dubai to serve clients better across the Middle East and the CEMEA region generally. 
And in East Africa, a region I recently visited, we are investing now to reap long-term returns. We recently opened a regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, an important opportunity in that geography using our Fundamo platform to deploy mobile solutions and drive long-term growth. 
We are also making steady progress in Rwanda, which offers a case study of how Visa can proactively engage governments and align our own growth agenda with domestic priorities. In that regard, we are working with the Rwandan government to increase access to and usage of electronic payments in that country.  A key priority is financial inclusion and literacy using mobile technology. 
Additionally, Visa is now processing domestic payments and interbank ATM withdrawals, an important step forward to this emerging economy. 
Also, our efforts will help increase tourism volumes from international travelers, a key driver of economic activity and a top government priority. 
Finally, this effort should be the foundation for our activities in the entire East African region.  Expect us to talk to you more about this in the future. 
We're also making steady progress in Indonesia, a rapidly expanding economy with a growing affluent middle class and a population, fast approaching 250 million. A key element of our strategy here is growing acceptance. To that end, Visa signed a multiphase, multiyear card acceptance promotion with the country's largest petro chain, Pertamina, with more than 4,000 gas stations nationwide and approximately $30 billion in sales volume annually, the promotion will help expand the acceptance of Visa credit, debit cards over the next few years. 
Most recently, during the last quarter's CyberSource, Visa's 2010 acquisition, signed a number of deals to accelerate e-commerce acceptance, including one with a national airline, Garuda, to provide payment, gateway and fraud management services.
Meanwhile, in China, I know you are already aware of the World Trade Organization's final report containing the findings of the case between the U.S. and Chinese governments concerning China's domestic electronic payments marketplace. While we are still assessing its implications, we are hopeful the ruling ultimately could provide for more global entrants into China's payment marketplace. Although, a number of additional steps still need to be taken in the WTO process before we have any clarity or certainty. 
Most importantly to Visa, we continue to make strategic investments to expand our existing business in China. To that end, we executed several long-term client partnerships during the quarter, including multiyear extensions with CITIC Bank and China Minsheng Banking Corporation. We also secured a new relationship with Bank of Communication. 
Overall, our focus is on advancing our partnership with local banks and China UnionPay to serve consumers and businesses using our existing 78 million pro badge cards when traveling abroad. 
In fact, earlier this week, Visa cosponsored a payment security symposium with China UnionPay. The symposium was hosted by The Payment and Clearing Association of China. It was under the endorsement of the People's Bank of China. 
During this event, Ellen Richey, our Chief Enterprise Risk Officer joined banking executives, regulators and law enforcement in Beijing to speak about Visa's role in payment security in the fast-growing Chinese market.
And finally, we are 2 days away from the start of the 2012 Olympic Games. There's a reason that Visa has been a sponsor of the Olympic games for more than a quarter of a century. No sponsorship platform offers a better opportunity to help our clients around the world grow their businesses while also driving incremental transaction revenue for Visa. 
Over the past 13 Olympic Summer Games and Winter Olympic Games, this sponsorship has provided Visa with a global platform to amplify our brand message among a passionate global fan base, then drive tangible business results. 
We work with our clients to tailor their Olympic-related activities to address the unique needs of their own business and geography, including cardholder acquisition, retention or increasing usage.
This year, I am pleased that Visa has engaged a record number of clients in our program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions of merchants worldwide activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. This represents a 70% increase from our program in Beijing and positions us for a highly successful event over the next 2 weeks.
So to wrap up, our strong performance during the fiscal quarter demonstrates the underlying strength and resilience of Visa's business model. We continued to accelerate the migration away from cash and check to electronic payments. We helped our clients grow their core business lines. We expanded our footprint in international markets, both emerging and established. We advanced our innovation agenda. And we took significant steps to resolve critical business issues. 
As always, I remain highly confident in the future of Visa. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,212665146,330988,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants lit",1573,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants litigation and the preliminary agreement with the individual plaintiff, since both of these events are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan. 
These accruals, which totaled $4.1 billion, resulted in a quarterly after-tax loss of $1.8 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding these litigation accruals, we reported solid earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter. 
Second, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. We expect this similar, if not slightly higher impact in the next few quarters, as more of our debit volume is exposed to lower variable fees and incentive agreements. As we have stated before, this is already incorporated into our guidance.
Third, foreign tax credits resulted in a benefit of $56 million or $0.08 to our adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. These tax credits were contemplated in our full year guidance, with the amount recognized in the third quarter representing the total for the year.
Fourth, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently 10% in the quarter. Through the 21st of July, credit payment volume growth has comped at a 9% rate, consistent with a somewhat tepid but sustained U.S. economic recovery.
Fifth, as anticipated, aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 9% growth rate in the third quarter, led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 54%. So far, the month of April has proven to be the trough in debit payment volume loss. And since then, we have seen sequential monthly progress during the quarter in recapturing portions of this Interlink volume.  
Importantly, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, continued to post solid mid single-digit payment volume growth. 
Sixth, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19%, consistent with our full year guidance range, which is weighted to the back half of the year. 
Higher incentives had 2 drivers: First, pricing adjustments linked to our U.S. debit mitigation strategies, which are expected to continue and potentially grow as our merchant and acquirer agreements take hold; and second, certain Rest of World incentives, which are not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, in late May, we received from the IRS a notice of proposed adjustment for our fiscal 2008 federal income tax return. This notice would disallow the deduction and associated tax benefit related to payments made in 2008 toward the American Express litigation. We disagree with this proposed adjustment. We are comfortable defending our position, and importantly, we made no changes to our tax estimates relating to this deduction or any similar deductions for covered litigation in subsequent fiscal years.  Resolution of these types of tax matters generally take some time to conclude.
Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global, payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 6%, down from the March quarter's normalized 10% after adjusting for the leap year. 
Several call-outs: first, combined credit growth for both the U.S. and Rest of World held steady versus a normalized prior quarter, both produced double-digit growth; second, Rest of World debit growth was unchanged at 28%, same as the normalized second quarter rate; third, more recently through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth was flat, comprised of 9% credit growth and minus 7% for debit. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a normalized 15% rate in the second quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and the Rest of World, 16%. 
We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions. Through July 21, cross-border volumes, on a constant dollar basis, grew 12%, with the U.S. growth rate of 9% and the Rest of World at 13%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. A debit-led decline of 3% in the U.S. was offset by 18% growth in Rest of World. 
For the month of July through the 21, processed transaction growth was a positive 2%, driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. 
Separately, CyberSource reported 1.3 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. 
Three call-outs: First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the rules next year; second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. Credit and Rest of World; finally, although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time.
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the March quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the June quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter, based on solid growth rates for CyberSource transactions and Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S., as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective in the quarter. 
As a reminder, the fixed acquirer network fee initiated in the third quarter is booked to data processing revenue.  Offsetting merchant and acquirer incentives are reflected in the contra revenue incentive line, which I'll cover in a moment. 
Turning to a different metric. We saw a step-up in the gross revenue data processing yield, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments, but also driven by the steep decline in Interlink transactions in the quarter, which are by far, our lowest yielding product.
International transaction revenue was up 13% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, with low double-digit growth rates in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in the Rest of World as measured on a constant dollar basis. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 19%. The fourth fiscal quarter will also see an elevated level, but is likely to be slightly less than Q3. Together, these incentive levels are consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. While we are not yet prepared to offer a more detailed view of fiscal 2013 incentives, we do expect a modest increase from the 2012 level of 17% to 18%.
Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our investments in growth-related technology projects. 
Marketing expenses of $242 million reflect a heavier weighting of spend in the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 58%, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to 61%, consistent with our guidance of about 60% for the year.  The third quarter's margin is in line with our expectation for expense timing, as we realize a second ramp up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics.
Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter and are $235 million year-to-date. Given our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year, we will likely come in at the lower end of that range. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q3 was 29.2%, and as I mentioned at the outset, was positively impacted by a $56 million benefit from foreign tax credits. The amount recognized represents the total for the year.
During the quarter, we spent $461 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $115.51 per share. Our board recently authorized a new repurchase plan totaling $1 billion, effective through July of 2013. 
Separate from the share repurchase program, on July 24, we added an incremental $150 million to the escrow account. The fourth quarter event will reduce the B share conversion ratio to 0.4206, thereby reducing the A equivalent share count by 1.2 million shares. 
At the end of the June quarter, we had 670 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the third quarter totaled $675 million. 
Finally, we are making only one adjustment to our outstanding 2012 fiscal guidance, other than the minor notes I've addressed. Given where we are year-to-date, we are eliminating high teens from our EPS growth guidance and going with just low 20s. As is our custom, we plan to fully address our 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We have no change whatsoever in our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders. To the extent that we are not placing cash in the escrow account, the alternative would be open market repurchases of our A shares, and that is exactly what we intend to focus on. So no change on that front, as further evidenced by approval by the board to authorize a new billion dollar share repurchase program. Second, with regards to margins -- let me reframe that, last year, we delivered about a 60% operating margin. That is our guidance for this year. The lower margins, that operating margins you're seeing in this quarter and we'll see again in the next quarter are all consistent with our guidance of about 60% for this year. As you may recall from our -- at the beginning of the year earnings call, beginning of fiscal year, we indicated that it would be about 60% for the year, but that we would be a little higher in the first half of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year, largely due to a ramp-up in technology investments and a weighted marketing spend for the Olympics timed with the second half. So this year, past year, about 60%, and we'll let you know what '13 looks like in another quarter."

So the guidance, the specific quantitative guidance we have for next year for '13, number one, is EPS growth in high teens; number two, incentives that are modestly, slightly higher than what we expect to experience this year. That's the extent to which we've guided to '13. And remember, when we said we expect revenues to generate, that's everything else being equal. We expect to have debit -- the U.S. debit part of the business annualized halfway in through the year. So in order -- I mean honestly, to give a much more informed perspective on revenue growth for next year, we'll wait to the fourth quarter call at which point we'll have much better visibility of what we're looking at going in. Meanwhile, we are reconfirming the guidance that we currently have for fiscal year '13. With regards to incremental wins, you can say we have some, certainly on the credit side. We don't have -- we have the opposite, so to speak, courtesy of the U.S. government on the debit side. And so in balancing those and looking at the current underlying revenue drivers of cross-border volume growth, transaction growth, inside the U.S., outside the U.S., that's really what's underpinning our guidance comments for '13 -- for balance of year and for '13 to date.

So whatever impact, with the exception of 2 countries, which I'll turn to in a moment, we can dampen the impact on FX.

The outlook for devaluation, I would say, is nothing's in certainty, but I would -- at some point, it looks like we're heading to that. And you can't -- there's no economic hedge for either one of those 2 currencies. So is that a bit of a drag on our Latin America business? Yes. Is it hedgeable? No. And so -- but that's baked into the numbers we reported. With regards to any other country call-out, I would say Brazil has tempered a bit. There has been a tax placed on credit usage for cross-border travel, which has definitely put a bit of a break on the exuberance of the Brazilians to see the world. That tax is not applied to debit, but it is applied to credit. And so I would say overall, particularly the rest of Latin America that the business is strong. It has very, very healthy growth rates, unimpeded by shifts in currency. Average credit ticket, no substantive change in that metric for the moment.

So the yield increase in the data processing category absolutely was expected. Remember a couple of things as perspective that as part of our Durbin mitigation strategies, we are -- we implemented a fixed acquiring network fee, which is completely captured in the DP category. We also reduced variable transaction fees, which are also included in the DP category. But we then introduced a degree of incentive offset, and that appears in a completely different line. So while the growth yield for DP goes up, it's not a true picture. And instead, you really ought to be looking at net yield, which I'll come back to in a minute, as it relates to Visa Inc. revenue yield. With regards to the DP yield, there's one other factor involved, which will -- which has an impact on the calculation, which is our lowest yielding product is Interlink. So as -- and that has borne the brunt of the loss as we conform to the new rules. And so as Interlink moves out of the denominator in terms of yield calculation, it has the least impact on the numerator and automatically, the yield moves up. And so you have both of those indicators going forward. There are a number of factors impacting the DP line. Debit is one, including Interlink; CyberSource booked into the DP line. And so I think what it's going to take is the next 2 or 3 quarters or so in order for us to kind of reset what the base trend lines ought to be projected off of with regards to data processing. So I think -- wish I could be more helpful, but I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before this sorts out. When you put all of this together and you look at the Visa Inc. revenue yield, of which DP is an important component, but that captures the incentives. In the way that we capture and measure yield, our yield for the third fiscal quarter of '12 is actually flat with the yield we experienced in the third quarter of '11, fiscal year '11. So a lot of moving parts. This is where we're sorting out, and I'm afraid it's just going to take 2 or 3 quarters before we can we reset the different trend lines on the different fee categories."

Visa had another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year. 
After adjusting for our previously announced litigation reserve, net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.56, a 25% increase over the fiscal quarter of 2011. 
So with 3 strong quarters of operational performance behind us, which include insights into both the initial adverse Durbin impacts and our fiscal fourth quarter services revenues, we are now adjusting our 2012 EPS growth guidance to low 20s. And we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $461 million of our excess cash to repurchase 4 million shares during the fiscal third quarter. Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program.
You've heard this before but it's worth repeating, the shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a global trend that we expect to continue well into the future. Today, more than 30% of global consumer spending, almost $10 trillion, remains on cash and checks worldwide. Interestingly, despite Visa's success increasing penetration of electronic payments over the past several years, the total opportunity to take share from cash and checks worldwide has actually expanded since our IPO, driven primarily by global population growth and expansion of many emerging economies where electronic payments currently represent a relatively small percentage of personal consumption expenditures.
But we're never content just to benefit from evolving demographics, Visa is taking action to accelerate growth beyond the secular trend. To do so, we are focused on building and expanding the entire payments category in every market that we operate. That means in our partnership -- that means in partnership with our financial institution clients, putting more payment products in more people's hands, tapping entirely new market segments with diverse product offerings, expanding the places where Visa products are accepted and innovating next-generation payment technologies that create a superior payment experience for account holders and add value to financial institutions and merchants.  
And as we are successful in expanding the overall payments category, Visa's business benefits through diversity and resiliency, which helped us continue to grow through the past economic cycles. So while we are closely watching economic conditions that could impact Visa's business, including fallout from continued volatility in Europe and softening outlooks for both China and Brazil, our underlying business drivers remain strong.
To begin my business review, let's first discuss the United States where credit posted yet another strong quarter, with payment volumes increasing 10%, Visa's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. 
In addition to strength in the overall category, I'm confident we picked up share in credit as we've added new clients and built upon Visa's strong existing client relationships.
Turning to U.S. debit, the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 and '13. During the June quarter, Visa's aggregate debit payments volume growth in the U.S. was negative 9%, as our clients complied with the April regulatory deadlines. This was driven by the fall off of Interlink payment volumes, which came in line with our projections. 
Meanwhile, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, posted healthy mid single-digit payment volume growth, which we expect to continue.
As predicted during last quarter's call, I am confident Visa experienced the trough for U.S. debit payment volumes during the fiscal quarter, and we are now seeing signs of improved performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. That being said and as we have stated previously, we recognize that some debit share loss resulting from this regulation will be permanent.
As for implementation of our debit strategies to compete for merchant routing and win issuer business, I will simply say I am pleased with our progress and confident in our long-term position. Our efforts remain on track, and our strategies are gaining traction. We are absolutely delivering the value we promised to our merchant and financial institution clients, and equally important, the strategies are delivering on Visa's own financial and operational expectations.
As for the CID, the status is essentially unchanged since our last call. I remain comfortable our actions are appropriate, and we continue to be in regular contact with the department providing information as requested. I'll keep you updated if and when the situation warrants.
Switching gears, I'd like to briefly provide my perspective on the proposed merchant litigation settlement announced earlier this month. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States.  Importantly, our current guidance for fiscal 2012 and '13 fully takes this agreement into account. 
I am pleased that we have settlements after an extensive process, coordinated by court-appointed mediators, which have been approved by class representatives, class counsel and the retailers who filed separate suits. We anticipate these will have support among the retail community in the U.S. because it is a fair and an appropriate compromise for all parties, and that the agreement will be approved by the court.  
As for the next steps, preliminary court approval of this agreement is expected in the fall, and Visa is preparing to begin implementation in the early part of 2013. 
Bottom line, we are moving towards ending a 7-year dispute with an important constituency of our client base: merchants. And we are doing so in a reasonable and responsible way. Looking ahead, we are actively looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with the U.S. merchant community to advance our mutual agendas. In particular, we believe that investments we are making in next-generation payment technologies, V.me, mobile payments and merchant offers, will drive considerable value to merchants.
Now let's shift the discussion to Visa's international business where we continue to focus on driving long-term growth. Breaking down our specific regions in constant dollars, payment volumes in Asia Pacific grew 13%, Canada at 8%, while CEMEA and Latin America posted gains of 41% and 20%, respectively, in the June quarter. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, a top priority is building the payments category globally. To that end, we continue to execute a targeted investment strategy in several geographies with significant growth potential, deploying locally tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year horizon.
So let me give you a few specific examples to demonstrate our progress. In Russia, over 80% of consumer spending is still cash-based, which presents a significant opportunity. To drive future growth, Visa is intensely focused on expanding usage in every day spend merchant categories, including supermarkets, a strategy that aligns particularly well with our strong stable of debit cards in that country.  
During the most recent quarter, Visa launched acceptance at Mutney [ph], the country's largest grocery chain, with more than 5,000 stores. In fact, with the addition of Mutney [ph], Visa now is accepted at the 4 largest food retail chains in Russia, a major step towards accelerated growth in that country. 
At the same time, in the Middle East, we are building on our traditionally strong position with a fluent [ph] and Shariah-compliant credit products, working with clients to expand debits. 
As one example of our success, Visa recently secured a significant multiproduct extension with the National Bank of Kuwait.
A key element of our strategy is increased investment in local expertise and local engagement. To that end, we recently opened our first offices in Doha, in Abu Dhabi, as well as doubled the size of our presence in Dubai to serve clients better across the Middle East and the CEMEA region generally. 
And in East Africa, a region I recently visited, we are investing now to reap long-term returns. We recently opened a regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, an important opportunity in that geography is using our Fundamo platform to deploy mobile solutions and drive long-term growth. 
We are also making steady progress in Rwanda, which offers a case study of how Visa can proactively engage governments and align our own growth agenda with domestic priorities. In that regard, we are working with the Rwandan government to increase access to and usage of electronic payments in that country. A key priority is financial inclusion and literacy using mobile technology. 
Additionally, Visa is now processing domestic payments and interbank ATM withdrawals, an important step forward for this emerging economy. 
Also, our efforts will help increase tourism volumes from international travelers, a key driver of economic activity and a top government priority. 
Finally, this effort should be the foundation for our activities in the entire East African region.  Expect us to talk to you more about this in the future. 
We're also making steady progress in Indonesia, a rapidly expanding economy with a growing affluent middle class and a population, fast approaching 250 million. A key element of our strategy here is growing acceptance. To that end, Visa signed a multiphase, multiyear card acceptance promotion with the country's largest petrol chain, Pertamina, with more than 4,000 gas stations nationwide and approximately $30 billion in sales volume annually, the promotion will help expand the acceptance of Visa credit and debit cards over the next few years. 
Most recently, during the last quarter, CyberSource, Visa's 2010 acquisition, signed a number of deals to accelerate e-commerce acceptance, including one with a national airline, Garuda, to provide payment, gateway and fraud management services.
Meanwhile, in China, I know you are already aware of the World Trade Organization's final report containing the findings of the case between the U.S. and Chinese governments concerning China's domestic electronic payments marketplace. While we are still assessing its implications, we are hopeful the ruling ultimately could provide for more global entrants into China's payment marketplace. Although, a number of additional steps still need to be taken in the WTO process before we have any clarity or certainty. 
Most importantly to Visa, we continue to make strategic investments to expand our existing business in China. To that end, we executed several long-term client partnerships during the quarter, including multiyear extensions with CITIC Bank and China Minsheng Banking Corporation. We also secured a new relationship with Bank of Communication. 
Overall, our focus is on advancing our partnership with local banks and China UnionPay to serve consumers and businesses using our existing 78 million co-badge cards when traveling abroad. 
In fact, earlier this week, Visa cosponsored a payment security symposium with China UnionPay. The symposium was hosted by The Payment and Clearing Association of China. It was under the endorsement of the People's Bank of China. 
During this event, Ellen Richey, our Chief Enterprise Risk Officer joined banking executives, regulators and law enforcement in Beijing to speak about Visa's role in payment security in the fast-growing Chinese market.
And finally, we are 2 days away from the start of the 2012 Olympic Games. There's a reason that Visa has been a sponsor of the Olympic games for more than a quarter of a century. No sponsorship platform offers a better opportunity to help our clients around the world grow their businesses while also driving incremental transaction revenue for Visa. 
Over the past 13 Olympic Summer Games and Winter Olympic Games, this sponsorship has provided Visa with a global platform to amplify our brand message among a passionate global fan base, then drive tangible business results. 
We work with our clients to tailor their Olympic-related activities to address the unique needs of their own business and geography, including cardholder acquisition, retention or increasing usage.
This year, I am pleased that Visa has engaged a record number of clients in our program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions and merchants worldwide activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. This represents a 70% increase from our program in Beijing and positions us for a highly successful event over the next 2 weeks.
So to wrap up, our strong performance during the fiscal quarter demonstrates the underlying strength and resilience of Visa's business model. We continued to accelerate the migration away from cash and check to electronic payments. We helped our clients grow their core business lines. We expanded our footprint in international markets, both emerging and established. We advanced our innovation agenda. And we took significant steps to resolve critical business issues. 
As always, I remain highly confident in the future of Visa. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,212665146,331087,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants lit",1571,"Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants litigation and the preliminary agreement with the individual plaintiff, since both of these events are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan. 
These accruals, which totaled $4.1 billion, resulted in a quarterly after-tax loss of $1.8 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding these litigation accruals, we reported solid earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter. 
Second, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. We expect a similar, if not slightly higher impact in the next few quarters, as more of our debit volume is exposed to lower variable fees and incentive agreements. As we have stated before, this is already incorporated into our guidance.
Third, foreign tax credits resulted in a benefit of $56 million or $0.08 to our adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. These tax credits were contemplated in our full year guidance, with the amount recognized in the third quarter representing the total for the year.
Fourth, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently 10% in the quarter. Through the 21st of July, credit payment volume growth has comped at a 9% rate, consistent with a somewhat tepid but sustained U.S. economic recovery.
Fifth, as anticipated, aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 9% growth rate in the third quarter, led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 54%. So far, the month of April has proven to be the trough in debit payment volume loss. And since then, we have seen sequential monthly progress during the quarter in recapturing portions of this Interlink volume.  
Importantly, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, continued to post solid mid-single-digit payment volume growth. 
Sixth, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19%, consistent with our full year guidance range, which is weighted to the back half of the year. 
Higher incentives had 2 drivers: First, pricing adjustments linked to our U.S. debit mitigation strategies, which are expected to continue and potentially grow as our merchant and acquirer agreements take hold; and second, certain Rest of World incentives, which are not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, in late May, we received from the IRS a notice of proposed adjustment for our fiscal 2008 federal income tax return. This notice would disallow the deduction and associated tax benefit related to payments made in 2008 toward the American Express litigation. We disagree with this proposed adjustment. We are comfortable defending our position, and importantly, we made no changes to our tax estimates relating to this deduction or any similar deductions for covered litigation in subsequent fiscal years. Resolution of these types of tax matters generally take some time to conclude.
Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global, payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 6%, down from the March quarter's normalized 10% after adjusting for the leap year. 
Several call-outs: first, combined credit growth for both the U.S. and Rest of World held steady versus a normalized prior quarter, both produced double-digit growth; second, Rest of World debit growth was unchanged at 28%, same as the normalized second quarter rate; third, more recently through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth was flat, comprised of 9% credit growth and minus 7% for debit. 
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a normalized 15% rate in the second quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and the Rest of World, 16%. 
We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions. Through July 21, cross-border volumes, on a constant dollar basis, grew 12%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and the Rest of World at 13%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. A debit-led decline of 3% in the U.S. was offset by 18% growth in Rest of World. 
For the month of July through the 21, processed transaction growth was a positive 2%, driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. 
Separately, CyberSource reported 1.3 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. 
Three call-outs: First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the rules next year; second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. Credit and Rest of World; finally, although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time.
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the March quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the June quarter. 
Data processing revenue was $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter, based on solid growth rates for CyberSource transactions and Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S., as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective in the quarter. 
As a reminder, the fixed acquirer network fee initiated in the third quarter is booked to data processing revenue. Offsetting merchant and acquirer incentives are reflected in the contra revenue incentive line, which I'll cover in a moment. 
Turning to a different metric. We saw a step-up in the gross revenue data processing yield, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments, but also driven by the steep decline in Interlink transactions in the quarter, which are by far our lowest yielding product.
International transaction revenue was up 13% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, with low double-digit growth rates in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in the Rest of World as measured on a constant dollar basis. 
As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 19%. The fourth fiscal quarter will also see an elevated level, but is likely to be slightly less than Q3. Together, these incentive levels are consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. While we are not yet prepared to offer a more detailed view of fiscal 2013 incentives, we do expect a modest increase from the 2012 level of 17% to 18%.
Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our investments in growth-related technology projects. 
Marketing expenses of $242 million reflect a heavier weighting of spend in the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 58%, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to 61%, consistent with our guidance of about 60% for the year. The third quarter's margin is in line with our expectation for expense timing, as we realize a second ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics.
Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter and are $235 million year-to-date. Given our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year, we will likely come in at the lower end of that range. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q3 was 29.2%, and as I mentioned at the outset, was positively impacted by a $56 million benefit from foreign tax credits. The amount recognized represents the total for the year.
During the quarter, we spent $461 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $115.51 per share. Our board recently authorized a new repurchase plan totaling $1 billion, effective through July of 2013. 
Separate from the share repurchase program, on July 24, we added an incremental $150 million to the escrow account. The fourth quarter event will reduce the B share conversion ratio to 0.4206, thereby reducing the A equivalent share count by 1.2 million shares. 
At the end of the June quarter, we had 670 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the third quarter totaled $675 million. 
Finally, we are making only one adjustment to our outstanding 2012 fiscal guidance, other than the minor notes I've addressed. Given where we are year-to-date, we are eliminating high teens from our EPS growth guidance and going with just low 20s. As is our custom, we plan to fully address our 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We have no change whatsoever in our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders. To the extent that we are not placing cash in the escrow account, the alternative would be open market repurchases of our A shares, and that is exactly what we intend to focus on. So no change on that front, as further evidenced by the approval by the board to authorize a new $1 billion dollar share repurchase program. Second, with regards to margins -- let me reframe that, last year, we delivered about a 60% operating margin. That is our guidance for this year. The lower margins, that operating margins you're seeing in this quarter and we'll see again in the next quarter are all consistent with our guidance of about 60% for this year. As you may recall from our -- at the beginning of the year earnings call, beginning of fiscal year, we indicated that it would be about 60% for the year, but that we would be a little higher in the first half of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year, largely due to a ramp-up in technology investments and a weighted marketing spend for the Olympics timed with the second half. So this year, past year, about 60%, and we'll let you know what '13 looks like in another quarter."

That's the extent to which we've guided to '13. And remember, when we said we expect revenues to generate, that's everything else being equal. We expect to have debit -- the U.S. debit part of the business annualized halfway in through the year. So in order -- I mean honestly, to give a much more informed perspective on revenue growth for next year, we'll wait to the fourth quarter call at which point we'll have much better visibility of what we're looking at going in. Meanwhile, we are reconfirming the guidance that we currently have for fiscal year '13. With regards to incremental wins, you can say we have some, certainly on the credit side. We don't have -- we have the opposite, so to speak, courtesy of the U.S. government on the debit side. And so in balancing those and looking at the current underlying revenue drivers of cross-border volume growth, transaction growth, inside the U.S., outside the U.S., that's really what's underpinning our guidance comments for '13 -- for balance of year and for '13 to date.

And I'm sure, as Byron has pointed out, that everybody understands, a lot of our '13 guidance was a reflection on how we would fare given the Durbin legislation. Right now, our metrics in every other regard are quite strong. And we will, as Byron said, address our expectations next quarter."

No. And so -- but that's baked into the numbers we reported. With regards to any other country call-out, I would say Brazil has tempered a bit. There has been a tax placed on credit usage for cross-border travel, which has definitely put a bit of a break on the exuberance of the Brazilians to see the world. That tax is not applied to debit, but it is applied to credit. And so I would say overall, particularly the rest of Latin America that the business is strong.

So the yield increase in the data processing category absolutely was expected. Remember a couple of things as perspective, that as part of our Durbin mitigation strategies, we are -- we implemented a fixed acquiring network fee, which is completely captured in the DP category. We also reduced variable transaction fees, which are also included in the DP category. But we then introduced a degree of incentive offset, and that appears in a completely different line. So while the growth yield for DP goes up, it's not a true picture. And instead, you really ought to be looking at net yield, which I'll come back to in a minute, as it relates to Visa Inc. revenue yield. With regards to the DP yield, there's one other factor involved, which will -- which has an impact on the calculation, which is our lowest yielding product is Interlink. So as -- and that has borne the brunt of the loss as we conform to the new rules. And so as Interlink moves out of the denominator in terms of yield calculation, it has the least impact on the numerator and automatically, the yield moves up. And so you have both of those indicators going forward. There are a number of factors impacting the DP line. Debit is one, including Interlink; CyberSource booked into the DP line. And so I think what it's going to take is the next 2 or 3 quarters or so in order for us to kind of reset what the base trend lines ought to be projected off of with regards to data processing. So I think -- wish I could be more helpful, but I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before this sorts out. When you put all of this together and you look at the Visa Inc. revenue yield, of which DP is an important component, but that captures the incentives. In the way that we capture and measure yield, our yield for the third fiscal quarter of '12 is actually flat with the yield we experienced in the third quarter of '11, fiscal year '11. So a lot of moving parts. This is where we're sorting out, and I'm afraid it's just going to take 2 or 3 quarters before we can we reset the different trend lines on the different fee categories."

Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of the $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our litigation. This was due to the withdrawal by the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide you additional commentary. 
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payment volume growth products in the United States as well as continued expansion of our core business in growth of processed transactions in international markets. Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year. 
Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get in to the specifics of broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year. With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent growth for the time being. 
Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Not only is he a proven leader, he has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not to miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call. 
Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion of Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis. 
Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. The credit products Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose and payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively. 
Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance. 
Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we secured our top 50 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements. In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefits to our clients. 
As to the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops. But we remain comfortable in our position on this issue. 
At the same time, we are making steady progress toward completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed the motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable by last week, [ph] which calls for hearings on the motion on November the 9th. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved. 
Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter, but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we'll continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon. 
In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future. 
Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services. 
Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, MPMC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States.  Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months. 
At the same time, we're making progress this signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. E-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012. 
As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified, secure e-commerce experience for consumers, no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solutions to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases. 
At the same time, Visa is the leader in enabling payments at the point of sale in the United States. Just one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless is currently enabling Visa payments by NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage from this long-term shift in consumer behavior. 
Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled 1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge. 
To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished for Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: to be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to the fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States. 
Today I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be the leader of our industry. And with Charlie as a CEO, I'm confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients. I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors with the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead. And with that, we turn the call over to Byron, Chief Financial Officer."
38043467,217824265,374591,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or notice of proposed adjustment, in connection with t",2063,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or notice of proposed adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008 had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6th consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has come at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently. 
Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off [ph] 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we were pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving. Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated in to our guidance. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11% with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S.
Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. 
Three callouts: first, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and the general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending. 
Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step up in gross revenue, data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are by far our lowest yielding product. 
International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes with mid-single digit growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis. 
Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%. 
While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year. 
As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4 associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. Finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus.  Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which as noted earlier was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33% and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July.  As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the 865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization. 
We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings. 
At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million and for the full fiscal year, 678 million. 
Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal '12, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013. 
That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers. 
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our AP SEMEA region as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives. 
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year. 
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as merged 2 [ph] business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned 1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date.

So today, as we enter into the -- new fiscal year, we have $865 million of previously authorized but unspent open to buy on share repurchase. We have $1.5 billion new program that was just announced.

There are different blips in a few countries around the world and in Asia in particular that are associated with specific events. Some of the noise between China, Japan has hurt some of the volume between those 2 countries in the cross-border volume and the payment volume in particular. And there have been other examples of similar situations. On the bias though, things are proceeding as well as we expected, given the overriding macroeconomic situation. We're very happy at where we wound up in 2012 including the fourth quarter and we'll have to go from there.

Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of a $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our covered litigation. This was due to the withdrawal of the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide additional commentary. 
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payments volume growth for credit products in the United States, as well as continued expansion of our core business and growth of processed transactions in international markets. 
Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year. 
Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get into specifics on broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year. 
With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent road for the time being. 
Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Charlie is a proven leader. He has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and that he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call. 
Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion for Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis. 
Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. For credit products Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose of payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively. 
Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to pull to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance. 
Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we've secured our top 15 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements. 
In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefit to our clients. 
As for the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops, but we remain comfortable in our position on this issue. 
At the same time, we are making steady progress towards completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable last week, which calls for hearings on the motion on November 9. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved. 
Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon. 
In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions, as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future. 
Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. But most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services. 
Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, PNC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States. Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months. 
At the same time, we're making progress to signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. e-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012. 
As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified and secure e-commerce experience for consumers no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solution to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases. 
At the same time, Visa is a leader in enabling NFC payments at the point of sale in the United States. As one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless is currently enabling Visa payments via NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage of this long-term shift in consumer behavior. 
Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions total $1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge.
To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished toward Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: To be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to a fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States. 
Today, I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be a leader of our industry. And with Charlie as CEO, I am confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients. 
I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors for the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,217824265,374712,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or notice of proposed adjustment, in connection with t",2059,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or notice of proposed adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008, had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has comped at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently. 
Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we are pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving. 
Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated into our guidance. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently, through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World, 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based, with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by a 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S.
Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. 
Three callouts. First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and a general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending. 
Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step-up in gross revenue data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are, by far, our lowest-yielding product. 
International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes, with mid-single-digit-growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis. 
Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%. 
While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year. 
As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4, associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. And finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus. Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which, as noted earlier, was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33%, and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July. As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the $865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization. 
We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings. 
At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million, and for the full fiscal year, 678 million. 
Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal 2012, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013. 
That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers. 
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our APCEMEA region, as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives. 
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year. 
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as a merge to business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date. Lastly, over that same period of time, we have reduced our common share count through litigation escrow funding and open market purchases by 180 million shares, representing $9 billion returned to shareholders. 
with that, operator, for the 19th time since going public, we are ready to take questions."

Now recognize, Brian, these are still, for the most part, robust growth rates with that we would love to aspire to here in the United States. But in terms of feeling light there, at least in the fourth quarter, there was a bit of a downshift that's -- I think it's economically driven. And with regards to just -- I know 4 weeks does not a trend make, but October was a bit encouraging as it looks like there was a bit of a bounceback in the month of October as it relates to Rest of World cross-border, as well as Rest of World processed transactions, both of which we have real-time visibility too. With regards to international revenue, let's see. We had nominal cross-border growth of 7%, and we had international fee growth of 5%. And if I look back over the last 3 or 4 quarters, there is always kind of plus or minus 2 or 3 percentage points of noise. I don't think there is any particular callout as I look at the drivers of international fees. It's just -- so I think we're pretty close to the nominal cross-border growth and no real callouts."

People expect that to move to $327 billion by 2016, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. We have a extraordinarily significant share of that volume. It is the fastest-growing category we have without V.me. And I think V.me will enable us to increase our share of the transactions. So not only are we going to be dealing in a category that's increasing, and even though that category may be taking some sales away from in-store sales, I think we will get a larger share of those sales than we have in the past. Any time you do something like we're doing with V.me, it's a chicken-and-egg kind of a thing. What comes first, all the merchants or all the customers? We're running at a pretty rapid rate as it relates to putting both on, and I think we'll have a successful start-up this holiday season. I think that by the middle of the year, we will have a much more robust environment. And by the -- and by a year from now, we'll be poised to take significant advantage of what we've done.

Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of a $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our covered litigation. This was due to the withdrawal of the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide additional commentary. 
Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payments volume growth for credit products in the United States, as well as continued expansion of our core business and growth of processed transactions in international markets. 
Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year. 
Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get into specifics on broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment, including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year. 
With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent road for the time being. 
Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Charlie is a proven leader. He has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and that he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call. 
Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion for Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis. 
Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. For credit products, Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose of payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively. 
Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to pull to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance. 
Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we've secured our top 15 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements. 
In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefit to our clients. 
As for the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops, but we remain comfortable in our position on this issue. 
At the same time, we are making steady progress towards completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable last week, which calls for hearings on the motion on November 9. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved. 
Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon. 
In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions, as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future. 
Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. But most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services. 
Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, PNC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States. Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months. 
At the same time, we're making progress to signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. e-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012. 
As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified and secure e-commerce experience for consumers no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solution to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases. 
At the same time, Visa is a leader in enabling NFC payments at the point of sale in the United States. As one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, is currently enabling Visa payments via NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage of this long-term shift in consumer behavior. 
Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions total $1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge.
To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished toward Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: To be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to a fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States. 
Today, I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be a leader of our industry. And with Charlie as CEO, I am confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients. 
I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors for the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron."
38043467,217824265,374769,"Visa, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2012",2012-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or Notice of Proposed Adjustment, in connection with t",2060,"Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or Notice of Proposed Adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008, had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million. 
Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has comped at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently. 
Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we are pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving. 
Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated into our guidance. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013. 
Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently, through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World, 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based, with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by a 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S.
Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year. 
Three callouts. First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and a general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending. 
Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step-up in gross revenue data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are, by far, our lowest-yielding product. 
International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes, with mid-single-digit-growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis. 
Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%. 
While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year. 
As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4, associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. And finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus. Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which, as noted earlier, was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33%, and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July. As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the $865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization. 
We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings. 
At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million, and for the full fiscal year, 678 million. 
Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal 2012, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013. 
That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers. 
Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our APCEMEA region, as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives. 
Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as a merge to business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date. Lastly, over that same period of time, we have reduced our common share count through litigation escrow funding and open market purchases by 118 million shares, representing $9 billion returned to shareholders. 
And with that, operator, for the 19th time since going public, we are ready to take questions."

We also have a habit of readdressing the opportunity for buyback at every single board meeting. So today, as we enter into the fiscal -- new fiscal year, we have $865 million of previously authorized but unspent open to buy on share repurchase. We have $1.5 billion new program that was just announced. So that gives us a little over $2.3 billion of open to buy. And then, of course, later in the year, should circumstances warrant, we have the opportunity to go back to the board and ask for additional share repurchase opportunity.

And so it's a little hard for us on the margin to comment on the PIN. However, on the Signature debit, or what we refer to as Visa Debit, I can tell you that our business has, since the implementation of the rules, I think in prior quarters, we have experienced solid mid-single digit growth. And that growth rate is on balance, drifting a little north in the most recent quarter."

I'd say our growth in the United States, particularly in the credit business, which is our highest-yielding business, is significantly stronger than any of our competition, and it continues to grow. And I mentioned that in my remarks earlier. We have strong growth outside of the United States as well. MasterCard deals in Europe, and we don't. They have quite a bit of strength in Europe, but our Asian and Latin American businesses are growing at very robust rates. We continue to believe that we'll have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in a very short period of time. I think that there is tough competition to deal with. I mean, I don't think there's any question about that, but we're doing very well. And in the parts of the world in which we do business, we are competitively advantaged, and we intend to maintain that."

Now recognize, Brian, these are still, for the most part, robust growth rates with that we would love to aspire to here in the United States. But in terms of feeling light there, at least in the fourth quarter, there was a bit of a downshift that's -- I think it's economically driven. And with regards to just -- I know 4 weeks does not a trend make, but October was a bit encouraging as it looks like there was a bit of a bounce back in the month of October as it relates to Rest of World cross-border, as well as Rest of World processed transactions, both of which we have real-time visibility too. With regards to international revenue. Let's see. We had nominal cross-border growth of 7%, and we had international fee growth of 5%. And if I look back over the last 3 or 4 quarters, there is always kind of plus or minus 2 or 3 percentage points of noise. I don't think there is any particular callout as I look at the drivers of international fees. It's just -- so I think we're pretty close to the nominal cross-border growth and no real callouts."

There are different blips in a few countries around the world and in Asia in particular that are associated with specific events. Some of the noise between China and Japan has hurt some of the volume between those 2 countries in the cross-border volume and the payment volume in particular. And there have been other examples of similar situations. On the bias, though, things are proceeding as well as we expected given the overriding macroeconomic situation. And we're very happy where we wound up in 2012, including the fourth quarter, and we'll have to go from there.

I mean, going back to the Internet, there were $327 billion spent on the -- or, excuse me, there was $226 billion spent in 2012. People expect that to move to $327 billion by 2016, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. We have a extraordinarily significant share of that volume. It is the fastest-growing category we have without V.me. And I think V.me will enable us to increase our share of the transactions. So not only are we going to be dealing in a category that's increasing, and even though that category may be taking some sales away from in-store sales, I think we will get a larger share of those sales than we have in the past. Any time you do something like we're doing with V.me, it's a chicken-and-egg kind of a thing. What comes first, all the merchants or all the customers? We're running at a pretty rapid rate as it relates to putting both on, and I think we'll have a successful start-up this holiday season. I think that by the middle of the year, we will have a much more robust environment. And by the -- and by a year from now, we'll be poised to take significant advantage of what we've done. As it relates to closing the gap in the top 10, I don't like to speak for my customers before they speak for themselves. But I am looking forward to and I think you could legitimately look forward to hearing a lot more about new additions in the very near future."
