I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvested the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation",933,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvested the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, the 1x in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store manage and access this flood of information. This megatrend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated nights corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business, we saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011 as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. Looking back of the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35% versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of home of the world's first 32 nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be associated on the China Unicom network in Q2 and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0  threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap [ph], whose the location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to a differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed the benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the market.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from 1 year ago and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data",774,"Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from 1 year ago and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% year-on-year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments and industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from 1 year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping Leading Edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 million, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth-quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortages. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected.
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit cost. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is a slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact to our business in the first quarter.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63% but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volume when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012, we are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and margin and high-end of our historical range at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we're making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011 and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the buildout of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend it 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down and we're still going to do use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to into our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like and things that differentiate us from the market and we get paid in a richer mix and so that's where our strategy going forward is we'll have cost-reduced products and we'll have a portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up."

Our view and the view from our customers and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggest that anyone on earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store but all of our channels are still channeling pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our preannouncement. And it's also a driver, Stacy said, for the under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories which is always very good for us. As a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded here this year than we've seen for quite some time in terms of CPU shipments, not necessarily for a PC shipments."

And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment actually comes out from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards more 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortages that we did some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generated older generation product in inventory and these allies that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to go offset to go faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012."

I think the thing is, it's tablets are a little bit better about hardware and an awful lot about software. And I think that until we get to Ice Cream Sandwich, the offering isn't as possible as what's out there with Apple. And as the Ice Cream Sandwich tablets start shipping, we'll be seeing better receptivity, Google has added the music store, the videos are better, everything got a little bit better bit ICS. And so I think the better test is year 2 here in terms of is there anyone that can compete with the iPad? And the other part of that test, of course, is the Windows 8 tablets that are being queued up for production. So I don't know that the whole tablet thing is settled down by any stretch, and I do have a lot of interest in, if you heard me at CES  about these hybrid and convertible designs as they apply to keep clamshells, where there's a significant blurring what people do with tablets and what people do with PCs. So the jury is out on I think the long-term segmentation by form factor. But I do think you'll see more progress on the Android type as a result of ICS."

I think Stacy talked about that last quarter. Those sales were lumpy. They tend to be a function of when Facebook or Google or Amazon decides to turn on a new Data Center and paid by x hundred thousand units. So there's a new generation and they want to have a complete swap out. And as a result, we're seeing a change to the historical linearity that we signed enterprise Data Center business for many years.

If you look at the spending of CapEx for 2012, and this is consistent with what we said last year. It's a big component of it, historically large component of it, is actually building the facilities, the 4 factory model that we've been talking about. We've got big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our CapEx, really, will be a portion of 2 things: the unit growth that we see going forward and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology and I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty -- a more traditional relationship going forward."

But our balance sheet certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount of debt for a company our size. So if we had a strategic need or decide that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that of our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development and CapEx. We bought it, we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 up fairly low interest rates, high dividend yields to accelerate that some and probably didn't ask a escape your level $4.1 million in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it."

I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation",929,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, D1X in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business. We saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35% versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's first 32-nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Unicom network in Q2 and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0  threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating the low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed the benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the markets.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

Our PC Client Group and our Data",777,"Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year ago and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% year-on-year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected.
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start-up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit costs. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact to our business in the first quarter.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63% but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volume when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and gross margin at the high end of our historical range at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build-out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

The CapEx that we're spending doesn't increase our cadence of Moore's Law.

Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to end -- to our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the market, and we get paid in a richer mix.

Our view and the view from our customers and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggest that anyone on earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channels are still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see -- we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our pre-announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories which is always very good for us. As a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded year this year than we've seen for quite some time in terms of CPU shipments, not necessarily for a PC shipments."

So first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that we've kind a -- it's a 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortage. We took some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to offset -- to go a little faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012."

Right now, the stuff that's sold in Christmas and into January were a very good mix of i5s and i7s, but the price points were $8.99, $9.99. As we move towards the second half of the year, and price points come down maybe as low as $6.99, the mix may come down a bit to i3s.

From here, our CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: that's the unit growth that we see going forward and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology and I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less.

But our balance sheet certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount of debt for a company of our size. So if we had a strategic need or decided that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development and CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low interest rates, high dividend yields to accelerate that some and it probably didn't escape, you noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it."

I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation",929,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, D1X in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business. We saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. 
Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35%, versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's first 32-nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Unicom network in Q2, and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0 threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating the low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed to benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the markets.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year ago, and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data",776,"Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year ago, and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% year-on-year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. 
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start-up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit costs. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63%, but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volumes, when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and gross margin at the high end of our historical range, at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build-out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

The CapEx that we're spending doesn't increase our cadence of Moore's Law. We're still on a 2-year cadence, and as we have shown you in investor meetings, we would go faster if we could but we don't think the industry can keep up with us. Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to end -- to our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the market, and we get paid in a richer mix. And so that's where our strategy going forward is we'll have cost-reduced products, and we'll have then also a portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up."

Our view and the view from our customers, and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggests that anyone on Earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channels are still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see -- we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our pre-announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories, which is always very good for us. As a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded year this year than we've seen for quite some time, in terms of CPU shipments, not necessarily for a PC shipments."

So first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that we've kind a -- it's a 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortage. We took some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to offset -- to go a little faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012."

And then the other part of that test, of course, is the Windows 8 tablets that are being queued up for production. So I don't know that the whole tablet thing is settled down by any stretch, and I do have a lot of interest in, if you heard me at CES about these hybrid and convertible designs as they apply to clamshells, where there's a significant blurring between what people do with tablets and what people do with PCs.

There's other elements in there around storage and networking equipment. And the other big element of that is the sales to the large Internet data centers that are being built up around the world. I think Stacy talked about that last quarter. Those sales were lumpy. They tend to be a function of when Facebook or Google or Amazon decides to turn on a new Data Center and they buy x 100,000 units. Or there's a new generation and they want to have a quick complete swap out. And as a result, we're seeing a change to the historical linearity that we saw in this -- in the enterprise Data Center business for many years.

We've got big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: it's the unit growth that we see going forward, and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology. And I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty -- a more traditional relationship going forward."

So if we had a strategic need or decided that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development in CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low interest rates and high dividend yields to accelerate that some,  and it probably didn't escape you noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it."

I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation",929,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, D1X in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business. We saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. 
Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35%, versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's first 32-nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Unicom network in Q2, and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0 threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating the low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed to benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the markets.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. 
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start-up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit costs. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63%, but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volumes, when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and gross margin at the high end of our historical range, at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build-out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to end -- to our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the market, and we get paid in a richer mix. And so that's where our strategy going forward is we'll have cost-reduced products, and we'll have then also a portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up."

Our view and the view from our customers, and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggests that anyone on Earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channels are still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see -- we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our pre-announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories, which is always very good for us.

So first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that we've kind a -- it's a 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortage. We took some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to offset -- to go a little faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012."

And what we can't yet predict is the mix between i3, i5 and i7. Right now, the stuff that's sold in Christmas and into January were a very good mix of i5s and i7s, but the price points were $8.99, $9.99. As we move towards the second half of the year, and price points come down maybe as low as $6.99, the mix may come down a bit to i3s. But I still think you're going to see people position this as a premium product. Their industry is enjoying a little sell-up around it.

Or there's a new generation and they want to have a quick complete swap out. And as a result, we're seeing a change to the historical linearity that we saw in this -- in the enterprise Data Center business for many years. So I think you should probably get used to a little bit more lumpiness here and look at the overall year-on-year growth, which is what we've been trying to discuss at the last couple of analyst meetings."

It's a big component of it, but historically large component of it, is actually building the facilities, these 4 factory model that we've been talking about. We've got big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: it's the unit growth that we see going forward, and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology. And I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty -- a more traditional relationship going forward."

But our balance sheet certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount of debt for a company of our size. So if we had a strategic need or decided that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development in CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low interest rates and high dividend yields to accelerate that some,  and it probably didn't escape you noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it."

PC consumption in",804,"Thanks, Mark and good afternoon everyone. The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions from servers to networking to storage across both mature and emerging markets. Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact in our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples.
We are ramping our 22 nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high key metal gate in the industry's first 3D tri-gate transistors. The move to tri-gate transistors delivers roughly twice the pavement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power application by smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our item roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014. We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior generation 32 nanometer processor. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages and power, performance and cost. Ultrabooks are reinventing computing the low form factors, high-performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in the decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect that touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no compromise devices and experiences. Global trends and data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world. The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming atom-based micro-server System on Chip code-named, Center 10. Center 10 will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores:64 bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility. This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lova, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender for security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration also successfully blocked the day 0 Pride x worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software's security strategy. Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-value high-volume shipments of Ivy Bridge products and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain. Despite discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged. For the second quarter of 2012, we were forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth.
This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain, as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin is 64%, was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22 nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs. As we progressed through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half. For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets, and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results in our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforced our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong. We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22 nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business, which bring us competitive advantage and we are using the cash flow we're generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Maybe it's worthwhile -- it's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition that was the 32 nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through tutorial and how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories, and at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories and in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sellthrough. And so the result of that from the cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter and will come down nicely into Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost. The difference there was there was 2 factories and today, it's 3 factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge."

We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March. And that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2 extra volume at Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a low on the Halem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers, as they know this Nehalem customer was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember last year we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet Data Center customers that I think Stacy, described as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that was Q1 of last year as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that puts us off-track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR.

Actually, I'd characterize Q2 forecast as being pretty consistent with underlying demand and I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me could talk through hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously, impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reducing our hard disk drives out there and as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with the hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe is pretty indicative of end demand just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And I think what's happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs and it's a combination of, they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older generation technology and its anticipation of a good Q4, where we have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for our sales can go at the end of this year."

We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touchscreens to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are quite frankly, just competition. When you -- when I talk about 21 designs shipping now, another over 100 more coming to the second half of this year. That is -- that's driving volume and that's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technology. I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500 gig hard drive into an Ultrabook. Something that we didn't was possible, and yet they have found the technology to do this and that helps give them an advantage and I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change and one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch-enabled. And up to now, that touch has been fairly almost a $100 add to the cost, to the materials cost. And we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we worked it, and has more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things of the OEMs and Taiwan, Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities, is really what's driving prices and costs down."

I think at the base of your question, is probably going up less than you are anticipating. This comes back to my comment in the January call, you have to keep in mind that a pretty large proportion of our capacity or CapEx in 2012 is in building factories. And they have a much longer depreciation schedule than as putting equipment in the factories. I think back in January, I said it was over 1/3. I actually refine that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and Fabs, as opposed to equipment.

And the relationships that we have with carriers globally are pretty strong, and they go back a number of years. And those are -- those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in their data centers and the reconfiguration of the cellular network infrastructure.
As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation from what's out there and service platforms serve as platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? What's our location-based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset? All of those are really hardware-centric features that employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity strength. That discussion is much more sophisticated and complex than just showing a roadmap and that's the level that we're at today with most customers."

We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin.
And that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as well as we can fill up all the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry, yes, perhaps. And I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where some companies with some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use QuickTime to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some outside -- third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how our way the need to work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is not for profit. It is not done strictly for just to get to know how to do this, and in terms of where it feels long term, I'll leave that point open."

And the answer is universally, no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we predicted so far. So 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight into Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD, morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some of our inventory we feel about Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that, traditionally, has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate -- it was a mainstream operating system around touch. And I'm very excited about that. So when you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- it's not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps it was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated by the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us. So what are we looking for, a relatively decent year with strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially, the United States markets."

PC consumption i",794,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and emerging markets.
Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3D Tri-Gate Transistors.
The move to Tri-Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power applications like smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior-generation, 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages and power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no-compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming  Atom-based microserver System on Chip code-named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope, delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility.
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day-0 Cridex worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.  Despite this discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain, as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs.
As we progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition, that was the 32-nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories. And at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories and in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sell-through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost. The difference there was it was 2 factories and today, it's 3 factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge."

We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember, last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that -- I think Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that puts us off-track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR.

And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being -- our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and that I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in-demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older-generation technology, and its anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year."

The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in towards yielding near-term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, quite frankly, just competition. When you -- I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another -- over 100 more coming through the second half of this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500-gig hard drive into an Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change, and the one that we're really focused on, is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly -- almost a $100 add of the cost, the bill of materials cost, and we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down."

To that end, as you're able to pull further ahead of the competition on Moore's Law, how should we think about that benefit manifesting itself, either strategically for Intel or on the types of markets you can address, the revenue growth margins or even the business model implications that you can do with things like potentially entering the foundry biz, et cetera?"

As compared to other non-integrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin.
And that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up all of the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, perhaps, and I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and I would ask you to look at those, as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how -- or where they need some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done strictly for -- just to get to know how to do this. And in terms of where it goes the long term, I'll leave that point open."

And the question I've been asked everyone as they come through here is do you see the year any differently than you did 3 months ago? The last time we were all together face-to-face? And the answer is universally, no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us. Also, we're looking for a relatively decent year, with strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially, United States markets."

PC consumption i",794,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and emerging markets.
Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3D Tri-Gate Transistors.
The move to Tri-Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power applications like smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior-generation, 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages in power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no-compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming Atom-based microserver System on Chip, code-named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility.
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day-0 Cridex worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.  Despite this discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs.
As we progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting.

It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition; that was the 32-nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories. And at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sell-through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost. The difference there was it was 2 factories and today it's 3 factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge."

We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that -- I think Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week.

And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being -- our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and that I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in-demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older-generation technology, and it's anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year."

The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near-term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, quite frankly, just competition. When you -- I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another -- over 100 more coming through the second half of this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500-gig hard drive into an Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change and the one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly -- almost a $100 adder to cost, the bill of materials cost, and we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down."

I think back in January I said it was over 1/3. I actually refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and fabs as opposed to equipment.

And those are -- those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in their data centers and in the reconfiguration of the cellular network infrastructure. As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation from what's out there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? What's our location-based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset?

As compared to other non-integrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin and that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up all of the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, perhaps, and I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how -- or where they need some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done strictly for -- just to get to know how to do this. And in terms of where it goes long term, I'll leave that point open."

And the answer is universally no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us.

PC consumption i",794,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and emerging markets.
Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3D Tri-Gate Transistors.
The move to Tri-Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power applications like smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior-generation, 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages in power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no-compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming Atom-based microserver System on Chip, code-named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility.
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day-0 Cridex worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy."

From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.  Despite this discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs.
As we progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting.

It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition; that was the 32-nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories. And at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sell-through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost.

We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that -- I think Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that puts us off-track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR.

And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being -- our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and that I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in-demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older-generation technology, and it's anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year."

I mean, how did that ramp versus what's going now compare with your original expectations as in back in January when you gave the gross margin guidance for the quarter?"

The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near-term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, quite frankly, just competition. When you -- I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another -- over 100 more coming through the second half of this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500-gig hard drive into an Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change and the one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly -- almost a $100 adder to cost, the bill of materials cost, and we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down."

I think at the base of your question, it's probably going up less than you were anticipating. This comes back to my comment in the January call. You have to keep in mind that a pretty large proportion of our capacity or our CapEx in 2012 is in building factories, and that has a much longer depreciation schedule than does putting equipment into the factories. I think back in January I said it was over 1/3. I actually refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and fabs as opposed to equipment. So I think that's why you're seeing less of an impact to depreciation than maybe your historical models would suggest."

There's obviously the traditional OEM manufacturers, and we've announced a number of those; but there's also carriers that are interested in doing a private label, and we've announced one of those with Orange in Europe. And the relationships that we have with carriers globally are pretty strong, and they go back a number of years. And those are -- those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in their data centers and in the reconfiguration of the cellular network infrastructure. As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation from what's out there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? What's our location-based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset? All of those are really hardware-centric features that employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity stream. That discussion is much more sophisticated and complex than just showing a roadmap. And that's the level that we're at today with most customers."

As compared to other non-integrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin and that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up all of the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, perhaps, and I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how -- or where they need some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done strictly for -- just to get to know how to do this. And in terms of where it goes long term, I'll leave that point open."

And the question I've been asking everyone as they come through here is do you see the year any differently than you did 3 months ago, the last time we were all together face-to-face? And the answer is universally no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us. Also, we're looking for a relatively decent year with strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially United States markets."

I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.
In a moment we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com. So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul."

Against a backdrop of mixed macroeconomic trends, our business in the second quarter played out largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both the PC and Data Center Group and our distributor channel had it's best Q2 in 5 years.
Our Technology and Manufacturing group once again delivered fantastic results. Our 22 nanometer process is ahead of where 32 nanometers was at the same point in its ramp, and ahead of our own plans. That enabled us to ramp Ivy Bridge to nearly 1/4 of our PC volume, our fastest ramp ever. We also announced an important agreement with ASML last week that we expect will accelerate the developments and deployment of 450-millimeter and EUV lithography technologies by up to 2 years and deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum and achieved our volume goals for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge-based designed in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be touch-enabled and 12 will be convertibles. With visibility into this many designs, we are very confident that we'll see $699 systems at retail this fall. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 tablet designs based on our low-power and low-cost clover trail Atom SoC in addition to a number of core-based tablets. In our Data Center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove record server revenues. In fact, the mix of 2 of our highest performing Romley product was more than 2x than that of the prior generation Westmere at the same point in its ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second quarter last year, with cloud volume growing at more than twice the rate of the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the Data Center on track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
High-Performance Computing continued to be one of the fastest-growing segments within our Data Center business. And earlier this quarter, we announced more technical details behind our new many integrated core processor due out later this year. Branded Xeon 5, this new product family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. 5 will be an important product for the HTC market segment with more than 50 cores, manufactured on our 22-nanometer tri-gate process technology. We already have more than 40 customers signed up to support the architecture.
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield-based phones from Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further established Intel in the market, building on the wide presence we have in base spends.
Overall, our business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, consumer market growth in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as we had anticipated. Worldwide enterprise demand is growing as expected. Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely. But are moderating due to EDB adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second half. We are now expecting full-year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range versus our prior expectation of high single digits. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate that having a deep and long-established presence in every geography, combined with leading technology, manufacturing and products are important in any environment. But there are especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. With a wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel-based tablets expected to be available this year and an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we remain optimistic about our future. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy."

Second quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Enterprise and emerging markets contributed to the year-on-year growth, somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core business came in as expected, though we saw softness in our NAND memory business. At our segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from a year ago and the Data Center Group grew 15%.
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy but are being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release. For the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range.
Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
As expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in the cost increase in the second quarter. We expect that the second quarter was the peak in terms of platform unit cost, with costs coming down in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, we have taken actions to slow hiring and as a result, are lowering our spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the third and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion, approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had a roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge ramp with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
While macroeconomic weakness in our expectation that our customers will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has led us to reduce our expectations to 3% to 5% revenue growth for the year, we continue to make great progress market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing lead continues to generate leading products and low costs. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Over the last several years, our distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you think it's shut now 5 years ago, most of the business was us, them distributing desktop microprocessors and motherboards then went into white box builds. And as the PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks, they became less of a driver of the PC volume, they picked up skill sets to do systems integration and are now among our larger server channels. So the distribution channel has ordered reinvested itself and reinvented and it's now a fairly significant force in not just the desktops in emerging markets or preassembled notebooks but increasingly into servers and storage systems."

So let me take those as 2 separate things. The inventory build, yes, it's directionally what we expected.
I think the one thing that, were able to fill Ivy Bridge a little faster than we thought, and Ivy Bridge is -- it comes from all the inventory growth at both units and dollars this quarter. And when I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is now more than 1/2 of the inventory that's been sitting in there. As I think about the next quarter, I think we'll be pretty flat and we'll see business levels start to grow and so days of inventory most will start to come down from year will be my expectation. The gross margin story for us is really a cost story. And I talked about this last quarter. We have this phenomenon where we ramped multiple factories at the same time on 22-nanometer. Those early products coming out of the factories are pretty expensive products. That led to a peak in cost in Q2. As we move into Q3, we now have where cost comes down rapidly on Ivy Bridge but as Paul talked about, it's about 1/4 of our volume in Q2. We're going to more or less double that volume in Q3. And so in this phenomena where cost come down but the volume doubles, cost good news in Q3 to be between 0.5 and 1 point. And then I got more cost good news in Q4 as that ramp starts to flatten out of it. And so really, the thing on gross margin is are we on the path of cost reduction of Ivy Bridge and on the ramp rate, we're doing great on the cost ahead forecast, that gives me the confidence that we'll see gross margin in Q4 that's kind of around 65%.
And that gives me the 64% for the year."

And we're forecasting a stronger second half than first half. And I gave you the year-over-year numbers. The -- what we had expected that we would see by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses will be recovering from sort of the softness that we've seen for several quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, 2 things are happening:one of the PC sales to be as robust as we once thought but the inventory replenishment coming out of the hard drive shortage is not as deep as we thought or as large as we thought, because people are expecting to sell into a smaller overall TAM growth. In terms of China and Brazil, which I think about -- I could have also spoken a little bit about maybe Russia in that, and India. In some of the countries we're seeing the prices of computers go up as a result of the currency fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC companies including ours are sold globally and dollars in PCs are typically priced in dollars, at least of the distributors of these countries, so the price goes up a bit as currency changes. In China it's a little bit different, we're seeing there is the abatement of GDP growth sort of a big in the quarter down to 7%, 7.25% and while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as much as before stock. We add all those together plus the fact that the enterprises are doing pretty good. You come down to a more muted growth scenario than we first thought."

What we're seeing is that in a time of tight consumer budgets, people buy quality, and they tend to buy the high end of the line, and reasonably higher end of the product lines.

Against a backdrop of mixed macroeconomic trends, our business in the second quarter played out largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both the PC and Data Center Group, and our distributor channel had its best Q2 in 5 years.
Our Technology and Manufacturing Group, once again, delivered fantastic results. Our 22-nanometer process help [ph] is ahead of where our 32 nanometers was at the same point in its ramp, and ahead of our own plans. That enabled us to ramp Ivy Bridge to nearly 1/4 of our PC volume, our fastest ramp ever. We also announced an important agreement with ASML last week that we expect will accelerate the developments and deployment of 450-millimeter and EUV lithography technologies by up to 2 years and deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum and achieved our volume goals for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge-based designs in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be touch-enabled and 12 will be convertibles. With visibility into this many designs, we are very confident that we'll see $699 systems at retail this fall. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 tablet designs based on our low-power and low-cost Clover Trail Atom SoC in addition to a number of core-based tablets. 
In our Data Center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove record server revenues. In fact, the mix of 2 of our highest-performing Romley products was more than 2x that of the prior generation Westmere at the same point in its ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second quarter last year, with cloud volume growing at more than twice the rate of the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the Data Center on track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
High-performance computing continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within our Data Center business. And earlier this quarter, we announced more technical details behind our new many integrated core coprocessor due out later this year. Branded Xeon Phi, this new product family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. Phi will be an impressive product for the HPC market segment with more than 50 cores, manufactured on our 22-nanometer tri-gate process technology. We already have more than 40 customers signed up to support the architecture.
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield-based phones from Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further established Intel in the market, building on the wide presence we have in base spends.
Overall, our business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, consumer market growth in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as we had anticipated. 
Worldwide enterprise demand is growing as expected. Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely, but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second half. We are now expecting full year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range versus our prior expectation of high-single digits. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate that having a deep and long-established presence in every geography, combined with leading technology, manufacturing and products are important in any environment. But they are especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. 
With a wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel-based tablets expected to be available this year and an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we remain optimistic about our future. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy."

Second quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Enterprise and emerging markets contributed to the year-on-year growth, somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core business came in as expected, though we saw softness in our NAND memory business. At a segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from 1 year ago and the Data Center Group grew 15%.
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy, but are being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release. For the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
As expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in a cost increase in the second quarter. We expected the second quarter was the peak in terms of platform unit cost, with costs coming down in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, we have taken actions to slow hiring, and as a result, are lowering our spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the third and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion, approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had a roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge ramp with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
While macroeconomic weakness and our expectation that our customers will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has led us to reduce our expectations to 3% to 5% revenue growth for the year, we continue to make great progress in the market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing lead continues to generate leading products and low costs. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Over the last several years, our distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you take a snapshot 5 years ago, most of the business was us -- them distributing desktop microprocessors and motherboards then went into white box builds. And as the PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks, they became less of a driver of the PC volume. They picked up skill sets to do systems integration and they're now among our larger server channels. So the distribution channel has sort of reinvented itself and is now a fairly significant force in not just the desktops in emerging markets or preassembled notebooks, but increasingly for servers and storage systems."

So let me take those as 2 separate things. The inventory build is directionally what we expected. I think the one thing that we're doing is we're able to fill Ivy Bridge a little faster than we thought, and Ivy Bridge is -- it counts for all of the inventory growth. It's both units and dollars this quarter. And when I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is now more than half of the inventory that's sitting in there. As I think about the next quarter, I think we'll be pretty flat and we'll see business levels start to grow, and so days of inventory most will start coming down from here would be my expectation. The gross margin story for us really is a cost story, and I talked about this last quarter. We have this phenomenon where we'll ramp multiple factories at the same time on 22-nanometer. Those early products coming out of the factories are pretty expensive products. That led to a peaking cost in Q2. As we move into Q3, we now have the phenomenon where cost comes down rapidly on Ivy Bridge, but as Paul talked to you about, it's about 1/4 of our volume in Q2. We're going to more or less double that volume in Q3. And so this phenomenon where costs come down but the volume doubles, I'll see some cost good news in Q3, it's between 0.5 point and 1 point, and then I get more cost good news in Q4 as that ramp starts to flatten out a bit. And so really, the thing I'm watching on gross margin is are we on the path of cost reduction of Ivy Bridge? And on the ramp rate, we're doing great on the cost. The ramp rate's a little ahead of forecast. That gives me the confidence that we'll see a gross margin in Q4 that's kind of around 65%, and that gets me to 64% for the year."

Well, first of all, let me color it by saying that we still see growth in all of these geographies and we're forecasting a stronger second half than first half. And I gave you the year-over-year numbers. The -- what we had expected that we would see by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses would be recovering from sort of a softness that we were seeing for several quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, 2 things are happening. One, we don't see the PC sales to be as robust as we first thought, but the inventory replenishment coming off of the hard drive shortage is not as deep as we thought or as large as we thought, because there are people expecting to sell into a smaller overall TAM growth. In terms of China and Brazil, which I singled out and -- but I could have also spoken a little bit about maybe Russia in that, and India, in some of the countries we're seeing the prices of computers go up as a result of the currency fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC components, including ours, are sold globally in dollars and the PCs are typically priced in dollars, so -- at least to the distributors in those countries, so the price goes up with the currency changes. In China, it's a little bit different. What we're seeing there is an abatement of the GDP growth, sort of 8.8% in the quarter down to 7%, 7.25%. And while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as much as we first thought. So you add all those together plus the fact that the enterprise is doing pretty good, you come down to a more muted growth scenario than we first thought."

The fact that we now have process technology leadership and we've transitioned all of our shipments to higher-margin segments of the NAND market like [ph] SSDs and compute-NAND. So that even though while it's impacting us at the top line, it's a business that still is generating positive profit and it's still generating positive cash flow.

Against a backdrop of mixed macroeconomic trends, our business in the second quarter played out largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both the PC and Data Center Group, and our distributor channel had its best Q2 in 5 years.
Our Technology and Manufacturing Group, once again, delivered fantastic results. Our 22-nanometer process help [ph] is ahead of where 32 nanometers was at the same point in its ramp and ahead of our own plans. That enabled us to ramp Ivy Bridge to nearly 1/4 of our PC volume, our fastest ramp ever. We also announced an important agreement with ASML last week that we expect will accelerate the developments and deployment of 450-millimeter and EUV lithography technologies by up to 2 years and deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum and achieved our volume goals for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge-based designs in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be touch-enabled and a dozen will be convertibles. With visibility into this many designs, we are very confident that we'll see $699 systems at retail this fall. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 tablet designs based on our low-power and low-cost Clover Trail Atom SoC in addition to a number of core-based tablets. 
In our Data Center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove record server revenues. In fact, the mix of 2 of our highest-performing Romley products was more than 2x that of the prior generation Westmere at the same point in its ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second quarter last year, with cloud volume growing at more than twice the rate of the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the Data Center on track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
High-performance computing continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within our Data Center business. And earlier this quarter, we announced more technical details behind our new Many Integrated Core coprocessor due out later this year. Branded Xeon Phi, this new product family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. Phi will be an impressive product for the HPC market segment with more than 50 cores, manufactured on our 22-nanometer tri-gate process technology. We already have more than 40 customers signed up to support the architecture.
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield-based phones from Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further established Intel in the market, building on the wide presence we have in base spends.
Overall, our business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, consumer market growth in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as we had anticipated. 
Worldwide enterprise demand is growing as expected. Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely, but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second half. We are now expecting full year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range versus our prior expectation of high-single digits. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate that having a deep and long-established presence in every geography, combined with leading technology, manufacturing and products are important in any environment. But they are especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. 
With a wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel-based tablets expected to be available this year and an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we remain optimistic about our future. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy."

Second quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Enterprise and emerging markets contributed to the year-on-year growth, somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core business came in as expected, but we saw softness in our NAND memory business. At a segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from a year ago and the Data Center Group grew 15%.
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy but are being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release. For the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
As expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in a cost increase in the second quarter. We expected the second quarter was the peak in terms of platform unit cost, with costs coming down in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, we have taken actions to slow hiring, and as a result, are lowering our spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the third and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion, approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge ramp with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
While macroeconomic weakness and our expectation that our customers will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has led us to reduce our expectations to 3% to 5% revenue growth for the year, we continue to make great progress in the market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing lead continues to generate leading products and low costs. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Over the last several years, our distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you take a snapshot 5 years ago, most of the business was them distributing desktop microprocessors and motherboards then went into white box builds. And as the PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks, they became less of a driver of the PC volume.

So let me take those as 2 separate things. The inventory build is directionally what we expected. I think the one thing that we're doing is we're able to fill Ivy Bridge a little faster than we thought, and Ivy Bridge is -- it counts for all of the inventory growth. It's both units and dollars this quarter. And when I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is now more than half of the inventory that's sitting in there. As I think about the next quarter, I think we'll be pretty flat and we'll see business levels start to grow, and so days of inventory will start coming down from here would be my expectation. The gross margin story for us really is a cost story, and I talked about this last quarter. We have this phenomenon where we'll ramp multiple factories at the same time on 22-nanometer. Those early products coming out of the factories are pretty expensive products. That led to a peaking cost in Q2. As we move into Q3, we now have the phenomenon where cost comes down rapidly on Ivy Bridge, but as Paul talked to you about, it's about 1/4 of our volume in Q2. We're going to more or less double that volume in Q3. And so this phenomenon where costs come down but the volume doubles, I'll see some cost good news in Q3, it's between 0.5 point and a point, and then I get more cost good news in Q4 as that ramp starts to flatten out a bit. And so really, the thing I'm watching on gross margin is are we on the path of cost reduction of Ivy Bridge? And on the ramp rate, we're doing great on the cost. The ramp rate's a little ahead of forecast. That gives me the confidence that we'll see a gross margin in Q4 that's kind of around 65%, and that gets me to 64% for the year."

Well, first of all, let me color it by saying that we still see growth in all these geographies and we're forecasting a stronger second half than first half. And I gave you the year-over-year numbers. What we had expected that we would see by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses would be recovering from sort of a softness that we were seeing for several quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, 2 things are happening. One, we don't see the PC sales to be as robust as we first thought, but the inventory replenishment coming off of the hard drive shortage is not as deep as we thought or as large as we thought, because there are people expecting to sell into a smaller overall TAM growth. In terms of China and Brazil, which I singled out and -- but I could have also spoken a little bit about maybe Russia in that, and India, in some of the countries we're seeing the prices of computers go up as a result of the currency fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC components, including ours, are sold globally in dollars and the PCs are typically priced in dollars, so -- at least to the distributors in those countries, so the price goes up as the currency changes. In China, it's a little bit different. What we're seeing there is an abatement of the GDP growth, sort of 8%, 8.25% down to 7%, 7.25%. And while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as much as we first thought. So you add all those together plus the fact that the enterprise is doing pretty good, you come down to a more muted growth scenario than we first thought."

I don't think it's just us. I think you're seeing that from other companies. It's led to us being a little lower in revenue. I think that continues as part of the lowering of expectations into the back half. There's a chunk of that that's NAND-related. I want to contrast it, though, it's really different compared to the last downturn we went through, which I think was about 4 years ago. You really see the impact of the strategy that we've been pursuing in that business. The fact that we now have process technology leadership and we've transitioned all of our shipments to higher-margin segments of the NAND market like SSDs and compute-NAND. So that even though while it's impacting us at the top line, it's a business that still is generating positive profit and it's still generating positive cash flow. I was a fairly new CFO when the last big downturn hit NAND and it was quite different because we didn't have that cost leadership and we were shipping into the commodity segments of the business. So I think it's a real testament to what they have accomplished in the business, but it's definitely soft."

Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance, as PC related billings improved in September over the July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately 1/2 of the seas",574,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance, as PC related billings improved in September over the July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately 1/2 of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise sales. The billings upside we saw late in the quarter reflected our customers beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later this month. As we look into to Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at about half of what we would expect from normal seasonality. Our revenue forecast growth is below these levels as our customers are taking a cautious inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes that incremental decrease in inventory at our customers going into year-end.
Our Data Center business saw the corporate servers segment softening over the course of the quarter, with the Cloud segment growing 50% over last year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record. During the last month, I've met with all of our major customers, although the market remains tough, I'd been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for innovation across the entire ecosystem. Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take advantage of our newest microprocessors, combined with Microsoft's new touch-enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
In the coming months, consumers will see tremendous form factor and industrial design innovation. There will be more than 140 core-based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that the combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of the tablet. Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price but with some SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom-based tablets from 6 or more OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand-new SoC that will enable tablets to send 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds. With 3 weeks of Connected Standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect, I'm excited about these products and the capabilities they bring to the consumers and the enterprise.
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next-generation core processor code-named Haswell. We originally targeted at 15 watts, we've made significant advancements significant advancements in micro architecture and process technology that will allow us to move Haswell down into the 10-watt envelope, clustering even more integration in form factor, as well as new usage models by computing and voice-recognition. We continue to make progress in handhelds, with Motorola's launch of the Razor I, the world's only 2 gigahertz smartphone that delivers better battery life than similar competing devices. In general, I see the computing market in a period of transition but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity. Intel has a history of navigating the industry's transitions and emerging better and stronger. With the hardware and software roadmap that spans the smallest portable devices to the most powerful Data Center servers and world-leading silicon process technology, we're excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy."

For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 1% from",559,"Thanks, Paul. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, flat from the second quarter and slightly better than our revised expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution that we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global environment, ongoing customer consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing enterprise market segment. As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking several actions. We significantly cut factory loading at the end of the quarter, and we're maintaining low factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustment to be helping done our total inventory levels by approximately $0.5 billion. Additionally, we are redirecting equipment and space to 40-nanometer from older generation technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July forecast for capital spending with the midpoint of our capital spending forecast for the year, now at $11.3 billion.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. 2/3 of the gross margin decline is the result of the excess capacity charges. In addition, we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation microarchitecture product code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter.
We generated over $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML. As a result of lower than expected sales in the third quarter, inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More of all -- more than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp, with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and redirect space and equipment of 14-nanometer but we're also seeing some important positive trends in the market. In the client space, we are seeing innovative products coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from Ultrabooks to smartphones to tablets. In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the buildout of the cloud and a substantial performance cost and power benefit that our enterprise customers get from our leadership products. Underlying all of this, our manufacturing advantage is extending in the rest of the industry as we start the ramp of Haswell, our new microarchitecture 22-nanometer and began to build out our 40-nanometer factory effort. The combination of the technical actions we are taking coupled with new products and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will all benefit our business over the coming quarters. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

So again, similar to the prior question, yes, I think it's premature to provide a forecast at this point across revenue, gross margin or CapEx for '13. We need to fight through Q4 first. There's a couple of things that I think you can model for '13 though that are helpful. We'll just talk about the start up costs. We're starting up 14-nanometer. So historically, that's worth 2 to 3 points of gross margin. In terms of the excess capacity charges that we're taking, we're taking a lot in Q4. I think you'll see that significantly better in Q1 and then by the time we get to Q2, I don't expect really any excess capacity charges. So you'll see that play out. And just to size those 2 things, in Q1, I think the excess capacity charges in the start up costs are kind of roughly similar orders of magnitude. So those 2 things should offset. Beyond that, I'll wait until we get to January because there's just many moving parts for 2013."

What we saw really specifically in the client side of it -- it played out roughly as we thought when we did the preannouncement. And if you step back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption but our customers continuing to manage inventories very lean and in fact, we saw across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall inventory levels in Q3 and normally in Q3, you see an increase. So we can kind of see a sense of how we're managing things. In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the Internet IP Data Centers, the cloud. It was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was offset but we started to see some weakness on the enterprise side, and that's where you're seeing a lower ASP just because of the difference in ASP between those 2 segments. As we go into Q4 in terms of the overall mix of our business, when I look at the gross -- when I -- I'll direct you to the gross margin Recon. There's an issue there with excess capacity charges direct you we have some builds on Haswell, really ASP has not impact in gross margin. And so you can take from that, that we expected to continue to be kind of similar mix and are roughly benign ASP environment."

The innovation is going to start pouring in now that you have widely available SKUs on a widely distributed operating system that's now -- that will come from multiple vendors that can unleash their creativity. What I can't predict is what form factor is going in here. But I do think that some of these things that have sort of the best of both worlds, the performance and the capability of a laptop and the form factor and convenience of a tablet, are likely to be the things that are -- are the most high-volume runners.

I went into Tier 3 cities. You don't see things stocked up or stacked up on pallets and stuff. People are generally -- I think most of our customers worldwide spent a lot of Q3 thinning out their Windows 7 inventory, so they wouldn't have an overhang at the launch.

What that reflects was really us going after some incremental share at the bottom of the market. So then we changed pricing but it changed the mix. And we thought it was time we could do some of that and we did it opportunistically. That's more the driver on that side. In terms of demand stimulation, a lot of what we're doing is really to make sure that the feature set of this season's Ultrabooks are really consistent with where the market is. That's why we're so focused on working on our customers and the ecosystems, for example, bringing the touch SKUs in. Six to 8 months ago, that we did not have the line of sight to 40 out of 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touched-enabled, that was probably 5 or 10. We're up to 40 now.

Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance, as PC-related billings improved in September over their July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately 1/2 of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise sales. The billings upside we saw late in the quarter reflected our customers beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later this month. As we look into Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at about 1/2 of what we would expect from normal seasonality. Our revenue forecast growth is below these levels as our customers are taking a cautious inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes an incremental decrease in inventory at our customers going into year end.
Our Data Center business saw the corporate servers segment softening over the course of the quarter, with the cloud segment growing 50% over last year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record.
During the last month, I've met with all of our major customers. And while the market remains tough, I've been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for innovation across the entire ecosystem. Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take advantage of our newest microprocessors, combined with Microsoft's new touch-enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
In the coming months, consumers will see tremendous form factor and industrial design innovation. There will be more than 140 Core-based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of a tablet. Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point, with some burst SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom-based tablets from 6 or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand-new SoC that will enable tablets as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds, with 3 weeks of Connected Standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect. I'm excited about these products and the capabilities they bring to consumers and the enterprise.
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next-generation Core processor codenamed Haswell. Originally targeted at 15 watts, we've made significant advancements in microarchitecture and process technology that will allow us to move Haswell down into the 10-watt envelope, fostering even more innovation in form factor, as well as new usage models like gesture computing and voice recognition. We continue to make progress in handhelds, with Motorola's launch of the RAZR i, the world's only 2 gigahertz smartphone that delivers better battery life than similar competing devices. In general, I see the computing market in a period of transition, but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity. Intel has a history of navigating the industry's transitions and emerging better and stronger. With a hardware and software roadmap that spans the smallest portable devices, to the most powerful data center servers and world-leading silicon process technology, we're excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy."

Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, flat from the second quarter and slightly better than our revised expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global economic environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing enterprise market segment. As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking several actions. We significantly cut factory loading at the end of the quarter and will maintaining low factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustment to help bring down our total inventory levels by approximately $0.5 billion. Additionally, we are redirecting equipment and space to 14-nanometer from older generation technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July forecast for capital spending, with the midpoint of our capital spending forecast for the year now at $11.3 billion.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. 2/3 of the gross margin decline is the result of the excess capacity charges. In addition, we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation microarchitecture product codenamed Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter.
We generated over $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML. As a result of lower-than-expected sales in the third quarter, inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More of all -- more than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp, with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and redirect space and equipment to 14-nanometer, but we're also seeing some important positive trends in the market. In the client space, we are seeing innovative products coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from Ultrabooks to smartphones to tablets. In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the buildout of the cloud and a substantial performance, cost and power benefit that our enterprise customers get from our leadership products. Underlying all of this, our manufacturing advantage is extending over the rest of the industry as we start the ramp of Haswell, our new microarchitecture on 22-nanometer, and begin to build out our 14-nanometer factory network. The combination of the tactical actions we are taking, coupled with new products and design wins across all segments, and our manufacturing leadership will all benefit our business over the coming quarters.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

What we saw specifically in the client side -- it played out roughly as we thought when we did the pre-announcement. And if you step back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption, but our customers continuing to manage inventories very lean. And in fact, we saw across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall inventory levels in Q3. And normally in Q3, you'd see an increase. So you can kind of get a sense of how lean they're managing things. In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the Internet IP data centers, the cloud. It was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was offset when we started to see some weakness on the enterprise side, and that's where you're seeing the lower ASP, just because of the difference in ASP between those 2 segments. As we go into Q4, in terms of the overall mix of our business, when I look at the gross -- when I -- I'll direct you to the gross margin recon. There's an issue there with the excess capacity charges. We have some builds on Haswell, really ASP is not a impact in gross margin. And so you can take from that, that we expect it to continue to be kind of similar mix in a roughly benign ASP environment."

And we thought it was time we could do some of that, and we did it opportunistically. That's more the driver on that side. In terms of demand stimulation, a lot of what we're doing is really to make sure that the feature set of this season's Ultrabooks are really consistent with where the market is. That's why we've been so focused on working with our customers and the ecosystem, just for example, bringing the touch SKUs in. 6 to 8 months ago, that we did not have line of sight to 40 out of 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touched-enabled.

And then the other thing I'd point to that's different is, while the decline is significant and we're taking some excess capacity charges, if you compare 2000 -- what we're going through now with 2009. In 2009, we were into the mid-to-high 40s, now we're in the mid-to-high 50s, and I think that really points to the structural improvements we've made in our business in terms of cost and mix and the competitiveness of our products. So while it may seem the same to you, it actually I think is faster, and we are still maintaining a higher gross margin."

So that may be a roadmap planning opportunity that they're pushing, but the products that are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets. You can look at some the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim, that would be conducive to, let me say, an array of microservers. And those can easily be run on Atom. We've got our second generation of the Atom microserver chips out now, with the first one on -- the first one's on 32 nanometers now, we're now sampling the 22-nanometer one. And we've decided that we're just going to push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about all the reliability features."

The work in process and finished goods that we're expecting to come down over this quarter are our Ivy Bridge products, which is the mainstream, high-end product we have today. So -- and as the market picks up, Windows 8 launches, Ultrabooks pickup and so forth, that just consumes that inventory. And as I said earlier, in my comments and Stacy's, our OEMs are running very lean right now. So any kind of demand blip would cause us to be able to reduce that even more perhaps. In terms of the mix, there's really not much more to add than we put in our prerelease and in the comments today, which is that, the U.S. and Western Europe PC markets remain soft in terms of consumers. The change that we have seen, and we talked about at the pre-announcement, was that the enterprise PC market has gone relatively flat now. And I think that's just a reflection of large corporations making hard decisions on CapEx versus people and where they want to put their investments. And now that seems to have spilled over from the client side of the enterprise to also the data center server part of the enterprise. And I think we'll see how that sorts out over the next quarter or so as CEOs and CIOs make their next round of decisions. In terms of China, the slowdown there was -- it's principally a notebook business, and the slowdown there was in consumer notebooks."

Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance, as PC-related billings improved in September over their July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately 1/2 of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise sales. The billings upside we saw late in the quarter reflected our customers beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later this month. As we look into Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at about 1/2 of what we would expect from normal seasonality. Our revenue forecast growth is below these levels, as our customers are taking a cautious inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes an incremental decrease in inventory at our customers going into year end.
Our Data Center business saw the corporate servers segment softening over the course of the quarter, with the cloud segment growing 50% over last year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record.
During the last month, I've met with all of our major customers. And while the market remains tough, I've been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for innovation across the entire ecosystem. Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take advantage of our newest microprocessors, combined with Microsoft's new touch-enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
In the coming months, consumers will see tremendous form factor and industrial design innovation. There will be more than 140 Core-based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of a tablet. Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point, with some burst SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom-based tablets from 6 or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand-new SoC that will enable tablets as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds with 3 weeks of Connected Standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect. I'm excited about these products and the capabilities they bring to consumers and the enterprise.
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next-generation Core processor codenamed Haswell. Originally targeted at 15 watts, we've made significant advancements in micro architecture and process technology that will allow us to move Haswell down into the 10-watt envelope, fostering even more innovation in form factor, as well as new usage models like gesture computing and voice recognition. We continue to make progress in handhelds, with Motorola's launch of the RAZR i, the world's only 2-gigahertz smartphone that delivers better battery life than similar competing devices. In general, I see the computing market in a period of transition, but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity. Intel has a history of navigating the industry's transitions and emerging better and stronger. With a hardware and software roadmap that spans the smallest portable devices, to the most powerful data center servers and world-leading silicon process technology, we're excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve.

For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global economic environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing enterprise market segment. As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking several actions. We significantly cut factory loading at the end of the quarter and will maintain low factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustments to help bring down our total inventory levels by approximately $0.5 billion. Additionally, we are redirecting equipment and space to 14-nanometer from older generation technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July forecast for capital spending, with the midpoint of our capital-spending forecast for the year now at $11.3 billion.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. 2/3 of the gross margin decline is the result of the excess capacity charges. In addition, we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation micro architecture product codenamed Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter.
We generated over $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML. As a result of lower-than-expected sales in the third quarter, inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More of all -- more than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp, with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and redirect space and equipment to 14-nanometer, but we're also seeing some important positive trends in the market. In the client space, we are seeing innovative products coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from Ultrabooks to smartphones to tablets. In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the buildout of the cloud and a substantial performance, cost and power benefit that our enterprise customers get from our leadership products. Underlying all of this, our manufacturing advantage is extending over the rest of the industry as we start the ramp of Haswell, our new micro architecture on 22-nanometer, and begin to build out our 14-nanometer factory network. The combination of the tactical actions we are taking, coupled with new products and design wins across all segments, and our manufacturing leadership will all benefit our business over the coming quarters.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

There's a couple of things that I think you can model for '13, though, that are helpful. We just talked about the start-up costs. We're starting up 14-nanometer. So historically, that's worth 2 to 3 points of gross margin. In terms of the excess capacity charges that we're taking, we're taking a lot in Q4. I think we'll see that significantly better in Q1 and then by the time we get to Q2, I don't expect really any excess capacity charges. So you'll see that play out. And just to size those 2 things in Q1, I think the excess capacity charges and the start-up costs are kind of roughly similar orders of magnitude. So those 2 things should offset. Beyond that, I'll wait until we get to January because there's just many other moving parts for 2013."

What we saw specifically in the client side -- it played out roughly as we thought when we did the pre-announcement. And if you step back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption, but our customers continuing to manage inventories very lean. And in fact, we saw across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall inventory levels in Q3. And normally in Q3, you'd see an increase. So you can kind of get a sense of how lean they're managing things. In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the Internet IP data centers, the cloud. It was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was offset when we started to see some weakness on the enterprise side, and that's where you're seeing the lower ASP, just because of the difference in ASP between those 2 segments. As we go into Q4, in terms of the overall mix of our business, when I look at the gross -- when I -- I'll direct you to the gross margin recon. There's an issue there with the excess capacity charges. We have some builds on Haswell, really ASP is not an impact in gross margin. And so you can take from that, that we expect it to continue to be kind of similar mix in a roughly benign ASP environment."

It doesn't change the fact that our planning model -- we're always looking to make sure we have the ability in terms of what we call white space, so some unallocated factory space, as well as some equipment to respond to upsides. It's -- the risk of being caught short and the cost of being caught short is much more than the cost of being long. Because as you can see when we get a little long, we can take actions and within a 6-month period we can get back aligned. If you're short, it can take you 2 years to get caught back up."

It's priced I think aggressively to move into the mainstream price points in terms of the stuff I talked about. If you look at our PC group numbers quarter-over-quarter, the ASP was about flat year-over-year. It was down a bit. Mobile was down a bit. What that reflects was really us going after some incremental share at the bottom of the market. So it didn't really change pricing, but it changed the mix. And we thought it was time we could do some of that, and we did it opportunistically. That's more the driver on that side. In terms of demand stimulation, a lot of what we're doing is really to make sure that the feature set of this season's Ultrabooks are really consistent with where the market is. That's why we've been so focused on working with our customers and the ecosystem, just for example, bringing the touch SKUs in. 6 to 8 months ago, that we did not have line of sight to 40 out of 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touched-enabled. It was probably 5 or 10. We're up to 40 now. And that's just going to get bigger as we go into 2013. So working with the vendors and the glass manufacturers to bring the cost of touch as an increment down has been one of the key things we think we can do to drive demand."

But if you go back before that, as opposed to a couple of quarters, you were sometimes talking about a couple of years to get capacity back in line. I think that's different. And then the other thing I'd point to that's different is, while the decline is significant and we're taking some excess capacity charges, if you compare 2000 -- what we're going through now with 2009. In 2009, we were into the mid-to-high 40s, now we're in the mid-to-high 50s, and I think that really points to the structural improvements we've made in our business in terms of cost and mix and the competitiveness of our products.

So -- and as the market picks up, Windows 8 launches, Ultrabooks pickup and so forth, that just consumes that inventory.

In terms of the mix, there's really not much more to add than we put in our prerelease and in the comments today, which is that, the U.S. and Western Europe PC markets remain soft in terms of consumers. The change that we have seen and we talked about at the pre-announcement, was that the enterprise PC market has gone relatively flat now. And I think that's just a reflection of large corporations making hard decisions on CapEx versus people and where they want to put their investments. And now that seems to have spilled over from the client side of the enterprise to also the data center server part of the enterprise.
