Joining me today are President and CEO, Timothy Main; and Chief Financial Officer, Forbes Alexander. This call is being recorded and will be posted for audio playback on the Jabil website, jabil.com, in the Investors section.
Our second quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2, our forward-looking statements.
During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected third quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earning results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and on other securities filings.
Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
And I just realized I must misspoke it, August 31, 2011, not 2012. As we indicated last quarter, we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we currently are still reporting and publishing core results, it is also our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we will also be providing guidance on long-term year-over-year outlook. This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we run the business, making strategic, long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our second quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander as well as guidance on our third fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with macroenvironment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from the call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

GAAP operating",1385,"Thank you, Beth. Good evening, everyone. As you're following along, I'd like you to -- if you would turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. Our net revenue for the second quarter is $4.2 billion, an increase of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $150 million or 3.5% of revenue which compares to $105 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in the prior year. Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 4.6% to $176.2 million and represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to  $168.4 million or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal quarter was $0.46, an increase of 84% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.58, an increase of 7.4% over the prior year.
If you now turn to Slide 4 for some discussion on our segments. In the second quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 33% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income is 5.9% of revenue. While our Specialized Services group exceeded our expectations from a revenue standpoint, most of the outperformance was driven by the Materials Technology Group. Gains from this group were offset by continued design investments in our health care business and weakness in our Aftermarket Services group where an internal site transition negatively impacted both revenue and segment profitability for the quarter by some 40 to 50 basis points. We expect this transition to be resolved and operating performance within our Aftermarket Services group to return to previous historical levels in the upcoming quarter.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue and core operating income for the segment was 1.7% revenue. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure performance remained below our previous expectations. As a result, continued end market weakness across our telecoms and networking customer base. I shall provide more color towards the end of my prepared remarks on our plans to return this segment to within long term operating range target.
Our High Velocity segment once again operated very efficiently during the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 10% on a year-over-year basis and represents an approximately 20% -- 27%, excuse me, total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 4% of revenue. The sequential and year-over-year margin outperformance in this segment is primarily associated with a more favorable mix of product. For the second straight quarter, we have 110% customer in each of those 3 segments. While our top 10 customers comprise 61.8% of revenue in the fiscal quarter.
If you now turn to Slide 5, I will review some of our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the quarter, we have cash balances of $707 million. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Telmar for $128 million in cash on the 1st of December. And during the course of the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for an average price of $22.73 per share or approximately $40 million. The impact to EPS for the quarter as a result of these repurchases. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP return on invested capital expanded by 2% to 22% in the first half of fiscal 2012. EBITDA for the same period expanded by $45 million to  $535 million or 6.2%, while cash flows from operations was $5 million. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $77 million or $180 million in the first half of the year.
In the quarter, inventory decreased by 1% to  $2.35 billion, and inventory turns remained at 7. Cash used in operations for the quarter was $109 million as a result of a more nonlinear quarter than we previously anticipated, causing average and period and working capital levels to be elevated. We expect working capital levels to return within recent historical ranges in the coming quarter, and as a result, a return to positive operating cash flows in both our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
I'm also pleased to announce that we have recently amended our bank revolver, adding capacity of $300 million to a total of $1.3 billion and expanding this facility into 2017. This continues to provide us flexibility in our capital structure as we continue to position the company for growth in 2013 and beyond.
You should now turn to Slide 6. We're pleased with our second quarter's results. Core operating margin performance was 4.2%, the midpoint of our guidance while revenues were at the high end of our range. Both core and GAAP EPS also is at the midpoint of our guidance.
If you now turn to Slide 8, 9 and 10. I would like to discuss the outcome the upcoming third quarter's guidance. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 2% to the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Core operating income is estimated to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million. Core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%.
Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59 per diluted share. This is based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. And based upon the current estimate to production, our tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18%.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment was expected to increase 25% as a result of growth across all areas within this segment. On a sequential basis, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to grow modestly 2% as we commenced product transitions and additional capital investments in our manufacturing technologies group. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 8% on a year-over-year basis.  declines in networking and telecommunications product set, offset by growth in storage. On a sequential basis, the segment is expected to grow 5%, with growth across networking, storage and telecommunications.
And finally, our High Velocity segment, we expect it to decline 14% on a year-over-year basis as a result of continued declines in handset volumes, offset by growth in automotive, point-of-sale printing and our set-top box business.
Capital expenditures in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be approximately $320 million. The growth of this investment is associated with continued investments in our Materials Technology Group, the group's capacity and capabilities. Total capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are now expected to be approximately $500 million with an excess of 75% of expenditures being invested in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, positioning this segment for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'd now like to ask you to turn to Slide 11 for a discussion on our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment operating margin performance. This slide shows 2 charts, the top being expected operating margin progression in the upcoming quarter, and the bottom, progression of the return to 4% operating margins in this segment during the first fiscal quarter of 2013 or 9 months from now. We expect the operating margin performance in our third fiscal quarter to improve by some 70 basis points, 25 basis points coming from both the growth in revenues in networking, program wins and product launch and storage and the recovery to growth in the telecommunications sector. The sites we acquired in France and Italy during fiscal '11 and targeted overhead reductions shall contribute 10 basis points each or 0.1% each.
Turning to the chart at the bottom of the slide, we have line of sight to return to growth over the balance of calendar 2012 with revenue growth in storage and networking contributing 1% and 0.35% telecoms revenue growth. Sites in France and Italy are expected to contribute 0.3% to the addition of revenues and cost reduction programs, while targeted overhead reductions across the segment shall yield an additional 0.65%, returning this segment to 4% operating margin performance.
With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment and growth by business group, and also for the first time, provide you some perspective on how we're thinking about fiscal year '13.
If you please turn to Slide 13. The Materials & Technology group is really about ingenuity and innovation, and we have invested for growth both in 2010, 2011, 2012, and we expect further growth in 2013. Typically, from the investment of CapEx, there's a lag time of approximately 3 to 6 months as the install the equipment, begin production and manage to higher levels of expected yields in that 4 to 6 month period. Currently managing through significant expansion of our capacity and introducing new product families across a broad range of customers. We're very bullish on another great year of growth and we expect over $3 billion -- roughly $3 billion in fiscal year '12 and hope to grow to approximately $4 billion in FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 14. In our Healthcare & Life Sciences business, Jabil is really a safe pair of hands. We pursue business in essentially 6 modalities: patient bedside, portable on and in-body, surgical and procedural devices, analytical lab equipment, imaging and single-use devices. We're very proud of the customer base that we have and we've spent a lot of time developing new relationships over the last few years. Although there was roughly a flat Europe growth in fiscal year '12, we do expect that rate of growth to accelerate year of as we enter FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 15. This rate of growth is expected to accelerate through the pipeline of growth, particularly to these large portfolios of products that are in our design labs today which will be introduced to production over the course of fiscal '12 and fiscal '13, and we have well over 20 designed with wins in this health care business area, and we're very happy that when those products go into manufacturing, they tend to have typically have a 10-year average product lifecycle. This leads to very sustained growth and gives us a great deal of confidence that our fiscal year '13 and '14 revenue growth should be at the top end of our 20% to 30% revenue guidance for the Diversified Manufacturing Services area.
Turn to Slide 16, please. In Industrial & Clean Tech market, we're really about solving global complexity and enabling innovation. We have business in energy generation, infrastructure, heavy machinery, light goods and a broad range of industrial products. We have some of the leading companies in the world as our customers, spanning activity from smart metering to agriculture, light goods and other types of Clean Tech areas.
Turning to Slide 17, please. We really are developing a global expertise that simplifies complexity. This is a really very high-mix business. Nearly 50% of Jabil's industrial energy manufacturing is in lot sizes of 50 or less. And remember that Jabil's business overall table builds about 70% of its output in large quantities of 100 or less. We need to have very advanced mining tools and to optimize production for these customers and we have very high performance, standardized inter- plant transfer process for business continuity and low transfer costs. We're very excited about continued growth in the Industrial & Clean Tech area.
Please turn to Slide 18. We're enjoying continued success of our core  repair activity in the Aftermarket Services area, and we are seeing additional growth in worldwide parts fulfillment, developing new capabilities that are really taking off now, including diagnostics, distributed screening and customer facing activities. And we expect our growth in Aftermarket Services to continue to be 15% to 20% on an organic basis. Taking our Diversified Manufacturing Services group in total, as we look at fiscal year '13, we see growth in our High Velocity area of approximately 0%; and Enterprise & Infrastructure, 10%; and then you can see Industrial & Clean Tech, Healthcare & Instrumentation and Aftermarket Services, we think these businesses can grow year-over-year on a 15% basis.
Materials Technology Group, as I've mentioned previously, now we expect to have another very robust Europe growth. This will easily support 10% to 15% growth in our fiscal year '13 and we're very excited about our prospects on a longer-term basis. I think we've spent a lot of time focusing on the short term, and we're very pleased with how our business is coming together from a long-term basis and looking forward in FY '13, '14 and '15 and continued growth of 10% to 15%."

Revenue wo",465,"Okay. In terms of Materials Technology Group investments, the slide that we developed and included in our presentation is, yes, Slide 13, is intended to give investors an idea of the lag time between capital investment in the advent of revenue. Revenue would typically commence approximately 3, 4, 5 months after the investment, and we'd expect to ramp into production through months 4, 5 and 6 and get to more mature yield levels and profitability levels by approximately the 6th months. We're going through our product transition now with new product families that are romping ramping, and we'll be doing that over the course of the spring and the summer and will be making some significant investments. So I would expect the margins in the Materials Technology Group to continue to be in the expected ranges. They'll certainly be better when you reach mature levels of production, a little bit on the lower side during periods of product transitions but still within the targeted range. It's getting to be a very big business, obviously. In half-year it commence we're looking at $1.5 billion for a 6-month period pace in fiscal '12 moving to $2 billion or more on half-year pace in fiscal year '13. So we're very pleased with how that business is coming together and we are adding capacity as we speak. And in the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, there's not a whole heck of a lot to report, Steve, except that revenue was a little bit lower than expected. And we think it's important to really focus on how we get back to 4% from where we are today. And I think we have a good line of sight. My own -- when I look at this business, there has been a very significant slowdown in overall Enterprise & Infrastructure spending from the spring of 2011 when the European debt crisis first emerged, a lot of caution throughout the summer. And as the U.S. had its debt crisis, government spending has been on the decline. That's impacted some of our higher-end government-related types of products. 2,500 spending had collapsed in certain areas of Asia. All of those provided significant headwinds over the last 2 quarters. My experience having been in the business as long as I have is that you have these periods of under investment, a little bit of excess inventory, people work through those and then spending starts to pick up. So provided that the U.S., particularly the U.S. market, continues to not be stable and grow even at a lower rate, I would expect IT Enterprise-related spending to start to pick up midyear and show some more normal levels of at least secular growth rate of 5% to 10% as we exit fiscal '12 and begin our fiscal year '13."

In terms of overall revenue, what I -- getting the guidance for the full second half of the year, it's somewhere in the region of $210 million, or $250 million, something of that nature. We are seeing a sequential uptick of 5 points this coming 90-day period. And we see any a little bit of tailwind groups to be better than that. But we feel pretty comfortable that the telecommunications business starting to see some pickup there.

In '10, it was significantly below the targeted range. In '11, it was near the bottom of the range. And in both cases recovered to the 6.5% to 7% areas. So we see no structural issues with that business at all. And as we bring some of these great health care products into the production cycle, we continue to ramp our MTG business, our Industrial & Clean Tech business continues grow in a predictable way and margins in an Aftermarket Services recovers from their product transitions among sites in Mexico, then we have every confidence that Diversified Manufacturing Services will get back to our expectations."

And we've been operating at that level for the past few years as well so there's some historical basis for that. I think when you look at Healthcare and Life Sciences, one of the things that we tried to highlight is the many, many design wins, the integration of design, our Materials Technology Group and single-use devices, our optics capability and integrating all of those capabilities into a very broad portfolio of new products that will come out of our product development labs over the next 12 to 18 months and contribute significantly to an acceleration of growth in our Healthcare & Instrumentation area. When I look at Industrial & Clean Tech, although a lot of people talk about it, I don't think that our competitors have the diversity and capability that we do I think we build high-mix electronics, have more low-cost locations than anybody else in the world and we consider Jabil's will be impacted mid-$17 billion range this year or at least about $17 billion of revenue this year and 70% of that output is built in  quantities of 100 less. We are the largest high-mix manufacturing business on the planet, and we think that's a very highly differentiated capability to bring to a market. In a world where virtually all customers are efforting to get to new places, new locations, tap growth in emerging markets, bring new technologies to the products that they have in their portfolio, leverage our product development skills and so helping our customer base manage through that global complexity, architecting -- helping them architect global supply chain networks is a significant differentiator."

In Enterprise infrastructure, my sense is that the mood is turning more towards optimism so I'm -- there is more bias to the upside. I think the overhang of the T-Mobile, AT&T acquisition put a cap on some needed infrastructure spend in North America. The collapse of 2.5G in China and some of the economic slowdown or worry about economic slowdown in Asia put a kind of a cap on spend there. And of course, we have Europe that's in the midst of a recession. My sense is that most of the inventory issues have been worked through and that we'll see an expansion of spend as some of the uncertainties have cleared down over the last 3 or 4 months. And then as people get progressive -- they've kind of know how the macroeconomic environment does but as long as it stays in the state of even lackluster growth, I think that the bias is more towards the upside. Diversified Manufacturing Services is just going crazy. I mean, we've got great growth there, we've had great weather and we expect to continue to have great growth there. And so our customers are happy with our performance. We're happy with our customers and we feel like we can continue to grow that at a world-class pace. And then High Velocity, that's not an area where we look for a lot of great growth but we have significant customer relationships there. Craig, we're getting pretty good at it. And in High Velocity to -- I don't think we'll continue to earn 4% operating margins in High Velocity. I would expect this Enterprise & Infrastructure margins improve. We might see High Velocity move into the mid-3s because we do need to support customers. It's a very competitive business. But that said, we've really been able to use lean manufacturing and consolidate our operations around the world and get our customers into fewer sites and drive a lot of efficiency that way. So we're very happy with our performance in that area. I don't think the consumer spend has been the great across the board but it's been okay and our customers there are doing pretty well. So I would say we're getting progressively more optimistic over -- than the way things looked 3 or 4 months ago."

As Forbes said, there's a very straightforward reason in Aftermarket Services where we have confidence that we'll recover. I think the brighter, the more interesting part of the story is, looking at FY '13 and the growth of the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, if you take what we've shown you on Slide 19 overall, Diversified Manufacturing Services is expected to grow at 22% in FY '13. Overall, that drives about a 12% to 13% growth for the company when you consider Enterprise infrastructure. And if you just look at our margin mix generally speaking, with Diversified Manufacturing Services conservatively in the 6.5% range and then more normalized margins in High Velocity and Enterprise infrastructure should be a great year for us. So I really think that's the more interesting part of the story. As you go quarter-to-quarter, you'll find these areas are relatively arbitrary. We'll have margin a little bit of margin variation as individual aspects of the business do better or worse. We're really happy that revenue is as strong as it was in the quarter, $4.2 billion at the high end of the range, and operating margins are at the midpoint. And EPS and earnings being where they should be in that environment. So it's kind of a bullish set of circumstances for us to be in today, particularly when you consider how we're doing relative to some of the other comparison in the industry that showed contraction in the December period. And we'll see how people do in the March period but I think we're essentially doing a good job of developing the company and showing good earnings in this environment."

Our second quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2, our forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected third quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earning results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. 
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings.
Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
And I just realized I must misspoke it, August 31, 2011, not 2012. As we indicated last quarter, we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we currently are still reporting and publishing core results, it is also our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we will also be providing guidance on long-term year-over-year outlook. 
This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we run the business, making strategic, long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our second quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander, as well as guidance on our third fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with macro-environment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

GAAP operating",1384,"Thank you, Beth. Good evening, everyone. As you're following along, I'd like you to -- if you would turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. Our net revenue for the second quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $150 million or 3.5% of revenue, which compares to $105 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in the prior year. 
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 4.6% to $176.2 million and represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $168.4 million or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal quarter was $0.46, an increase of 84% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.58, an increase of 7.4% over the prior year.
If you now turn to Slide 4 for some discussion on our segments. In the second quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 33% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income is 5.9% of revenue. 
While our Specialized Services group exceeded our expectations from a revenue standpoint, most of the outperformance was driven by Materials Technology group. Gains in this group were offset by continued design investments in our healthcare business and weakness in our Aftermarket Services group, where an internal site transition negatively impacted both revenue and segment profitability for the quarter by some 40 to 50 basis points. We expect this transition to be resolved and operating performance within our Aftermarket Services group to return to previous historical levels in the upcoming quarter.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue and core operating income for the segment was 1.7% revenue. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure performance remained below our previous expectations as a result of continued end market weakness across our telecoms and networking customer base. I shall provide more color towards the end of my prepared remarks on our plans to return this segment to within our long-term operating range targets.
Our High Velocity segment once again operated very efficiently during the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 10% on a year-over-year basis and represents an approximately 20% -- 27%, excuse me, total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 4% of revenue. The sequential and year-over-year margin outperformance in this segment is primarily associated with a more favorable mix of product. 
For the second straight quarter, we have 110% customer in each of those 3 segments. While our top 10 customers comprise 61.8% of revenue in the fiscal quarter.
If you now turn to Slide 5, I will review some of our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the quarter, we've cash balances of $707 million. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Telmar for $128 million in cash on the 1st of December. And during the course of the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares with an average price of $22.73 per share or approximately $40 million. There was little impact to EPS for the quarter as a result of these repurchases. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP return on investment capital expanded by 2% to 22% in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
EBITDA for the same period expanded by $45 million to $535 million or 6.2%, while cash flows from operations was $5 million. 
Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $77 million or $180 million in the first half of the year.
In the quarter, inventory decreased by 1% to  $2.35 billion, and inventory turns remained at 7. Cash used in operations for the quarter was $109 million as a result of a more nonlinear quarter than we previously anticipated, causing average and period and working capital levels to be elevated. We expect working capital levels to return to within recent historical ranges in the coming quarter, and as a result, a return to positive operating cash flows in both our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
I'm also pleased to announce that we have recently amended our bank revolver, adding capacity of $300 million to a total of $1.3 billion and extending this facility into 2017. This continues to provide us flexibility in our capital structure as we continue to position the company for growth in 2013 and beyond.
You should now turn to Slide 6. We're pleased with our second quarter's results. Core operating margin performance was 4.2%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were at the high end of our range. Both core and GAAP EPS also is at the midpoint of our guidance.
If you now turn to Slide 8, 9 and 10. I would like to discuss the upcoming third quarter's guidance. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 2% in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Core operating income is estimated to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million. Core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%.
Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
This is based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. And based upon the current estimate to production, our tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18%.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25% as a result of growth across all areas within this segment. On a sequential basis, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to grow modestly at 2% as we commence product transitions and additional capital investments in our Manufacturing Technologies group. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 8% on a year-over-year basis, slight declines in networking and telecommunications product set, offset by growth in storage. On a sequential basis, the segment is expected to grow 5%, with growth across networking, storage and telecommunications.
And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 14% on a year-over-year basis as a result of continued declines in handset volumes, offset by growth in automotive, point-of-sale printing and our set-top box business.
Capital expenditures in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be approximately $320 million. Majority of this investment is associated with continued investments in our Materials Technology group, group's capacity and capabilities. 
Total capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are now expected to be approximately $500 million with an excess of 75% of these expenditures being invested in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, positioning this segment for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'd now like to ask you to turn to Slide 11 for a discussion on our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment operating margin performance. This slide shows 2 charts, the top being expected operating margin progression in the upcoming quarter and the bottom, progression of a return to 4% operating margins in this segment during the first fiscal quarter of 2013 or 9 months from now. 
We expect the operating margin performance in our third fiscal quarter to improve by some 70 basis points, 25 basis points coming from both the growth in revenues in networking, program wins and product launch and storage and a recovery to growth in the telecommunications sector. The sites we acquired in France and Italy during fiscal '11 and targeted overhead reductions shall contribute 10 basis points each or 0.1% each.
Turning to the chart at the bottom of the slide. We have line of sight to return to growth over the balance of calendar 2012, with revenue growth in storage and networking contributing 1% and 0.35% telecoms revenue growth. Sites in France and Italy are expected to contribute 0.3% through the addition of revenues and cost reduction programs, while targeted overhead reductions across this segment shall yield an additional 0.65%, returning this segment to 4% operating margin performance.
With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment and growth by business group, and also for the first time, provide you some perspective on how we're thinking about fiscal year '13.
If you please turn to Slide 13. Our Materials Technology group is really about ingenuity and innovation, and we have invested for growth both in 2010, 2011, 2012, and we expect further growth in 2013. Typically from the investment of CapEx there's a lag time of approximately 3 to 6 months as we install the equipment, begin production and manage too higher levels of expected yields in that 4 to 6 month period, currently managing through significant expansion of our capacity and introducing new product families across a broad range of customers. We're very bullish on another great year of growth, and we expect over $3 billion -- roughly $3 billion in fiscal year '12 and hope to grow to approximately $4 billion in FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 14. In our Healthcare & Life Sciences business, Jabil is really a safe pair of hands. We pursue business in essentially 6 modalities: patient bedside, portable on- and in-body, surgical or procedural devices, analytical lab equipment, imaging and single-use devices. We're very proud of the customer base that we have and we've spent a lot of time developing new relationships over the last few years. 
Although there was roughly a flat year of growth in fiscal year '12, we do expect that rate of growth to accelerate as we enter FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 15. This rate of growth is expected to accelerate through the pipeline of growth, particularly to this large portfolio of products that are in our design labs today, which will be introduced to production over the course of fiscal '12 and fiscal '13, and we have well over 20 design wins in this healthcare business area. And we're very happy that when those products go into manufacturing, they tend to have -- typically have a 10-year average product life cycle. This leads to very sustained growth and gives us a great deal of confidence that our fiscal year '13 and '14 revenue growth should be at the top end of our 20% to 30% revenue guidance for the Diversified Manufacturing Services area.
Turn to Slide 16, please. In Industrial & Clean Tech market, we're really about solving global complexity and enabling innovation. We have business in energy generation, infrastructure, heavy machinery, light goods and a broad range of industrial products. We have some of the leading companies in the world as our customers, spanning activity from smart metering to agriculture, light goods and other types of Clean Tech areas.
Turning to Slide 17, please. We really are developing a global expertise that simplifies complexity. This is really a very high-mixed business. Nearly 50% of Jabil's industrial energy manufacturing is in lot sizes of 50 or less. And remember that Jabil's business, overall, Jabil builds about 70% of its output in lot quantities of 100 or less.  We need to have very advanced planning tools, techniques to optimize production for these customers and we have very high performance, standardized inter-plant product transfer process for business continuity and low transfer costs. We're very excited about continued growth in the Industrial & Clean Tech area.
Please turn to Slide 18. We're enjoying continued success of our core depot repair activity in the Aftermarket Services area, and we are seeing additional growth in worldwide parts fulfillment, developing new capabilities that are really taking off now, including diagnostics, distributed screening and customer-facing activities. And we expect our growth in Aftermarket Services to continue to be 15% to 20% on an organic basis. 
Taking our Diversified Manufacturing Services group in total as we look at fiscal year '13, I see growth in our High Velocity area of approximately 0%; in Enterprise & Infrastructure, 10%; and then you can see in Industrial & Clean Tech, Healthcare & Instrumentation and Aftermarket Services, we think these businesses can grow year-over-year on a 15% basis.
Materials Technology Group, as I've mentioned previously, now we expect to have another very robust year growth. Now this will easily support 10% to 15% growth in our fiscal year '13, and we're very excited about our prospects on a longer-term basis. 
I think we've spent a lot of time focusing on the short term, and we're very pleased with how our business is coming together from a long-term basis and looking forward in FY '13, '14 and '15 and seeing continued growth of 10% to 15%."

Revenue wo",461,"Okay. In terms of Materials Technology Group investments, the slide that we developed and included in our presentation is, yes, Slide 13, is intended to give investors an idea of the lag time between capital investment in the advent of revenue. Revenue would typically commence approximately 3, 4, 5 months after the investment, and we'd expect to ramp into production through months 4, 5 and 6 and get to more mature yield levels and profitability levels by approximately the 6th month. We're going through our product transition now with new product families that are ramping. We'll be doing that over the course of the spring and summer and making some significant investments. So I would expect the margins in the Materials Technology Group to continue to be in the expected ranges. They'll certainly be better when you reach mature levels of production, a little bit on the lower side during periods of product transitions, but still within the targeted range. It's getting to be a very big business obviously. In half year it commenced -- we're looking at $1.5 billion per 6-month period pace in fiscal '12 moving to $2 billion or more half year pace in fiscal year '13. So we're very pleased with how that business is coming together, and we are adding capacity as we speak. In terms of the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, there's not a whole heck of a lot to report, Steve, except that revenue was a little bit lower than expected. And we think it's important to really focus on how we get back to 4% from where we are today. And I think we have a good line of sight. My own -- when I look at this business, there has been a very significant slowdown in overall Enterprise & Infrastructure spending from the spring of 2011 when the European debt crisis first emerged, a lot of caution throughout the summer. And as the U.S. had its debt crisis, government spending has been on the decline. That has impacted some of our higher-end government-related types of products. 2,500 spending had collapsed in certain areas of Asia. All of those provided significant headwinds over the last few quarters. My experience having been in the business as long as I have is that you have these periods of under-investment, a little bit of excess inventory, people work through those, and then spending starts to pick up. So provided that the U.S., particularly the U.S. market, continues to be stable and grow even at a lower rate, I would expect IT Enterprise-related spending to start to pick up midyear and show some more normal levels of at least secular growth rate of 5% to 10% as we exit fiscal '12 and begin our fiscal year '13."

We are seeing a sequential uptick of 5 points this coming 90-day period. And we don't see any a little bit of tailwind to include -- to be better than that.

In Enterprise & Infrastructure, my sense is that the mood is turning more towards optimism so I'm -- there's more bias to the upside. I think the overhang of the T-Mobile, AT&T acquisition put a cap on some needed infrastructure spend in North America. The collapse of 2,500 in China and some of the economic slowdown or worry about economic slowdown in Asia put a kind of a cap on spend there. And of course, we have Europe that's in the midst of a recession. My sense is that most of the inventory issues had been worked through, and that we'll see an expansion of spend as some of the uncertainties have cleared down over the last 3 or 4 months. And then as people get progressive -- they've kind of know how the macroeconomic environment does, but as long as it stays in a state of even lackluster growth, I think that the bias is more towards the upside.

We might see High Velocity move into the mid-3s because we do need to support customers. It's a very competitive business. But that said, we've really been able to use lean manufacturing and consolidate our operations around the world and get our customers into fewer sites and drive a lot of efficiency that way.

As Forbes said, there's a very straightforward reason in Aftermarket Services, why we have confidence that will recover. I think the brighter -- the more interesting part of the story is looking at FY '13 and the growth of the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. If you take from what we've shown you on Slide 19 overall, Diversified Manufacturing Services is expected to grow at 22% in FY '13. Overall, that drives about a 12% to 13% growth for the company when you consider Enterprise & Infrastructure. And if you just look at our margin mix generally speaking, with Diversified Manufacturing Services conservatively in the 6.5% range and then more normalized margins in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure should be a great year for us. So I really think that's the more interesting part of the story. As we go quarter-to-quarter, in these [indiscernible] areas are relatively arbitrary. We'll have margin -- a little bit of margin variation as individual aspects of the business do better or worse. We're really happy that revenue is as strong as it was in the quarter, $4.2 billion, at the high end of the range and operating margins at the midpoint and EPS and earnings being where they should be in that environment. So that's kind of a bullish set of circumstances for us to be in today, particularly when you consider how we're doing relative to some of the other comparison in the industry that showed contraction in the December period. And we'll see how people do in the March period, but I think we're essentially doing a good job of growing the company and showing good earnings in this environment."

This call is being recorded and will be posted for audio playback on the Jabil website, jabil.com, in the Investors section.
Our second quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2, our forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected third quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earning results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. 
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings.
Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
And I just realized I must misspoke it, August 31, 2011, not 2012. As we indicated last quarter, we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we currently are still reporting and publishing core results, it is also our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we will also be providing guidance on long-term year-over-year outlook. 
This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we run the business, making strategic, long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our second quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander, as well as guidance on our third fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with macro-environment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

GAAP operating",1384,"Thank you, Beth. Good evening, everyone. As you're following along, I'd like you to -- if you would turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. Our net revenue for the second quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $150 million or 3.5% of revenue, which compares to $105 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in the prior year. 
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 4.6% to $176.2 million and represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $168.4 million or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal quarter was $0.46, an increase of 84% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.58, an increase of 7.4% over the prior year.
If you now turn to Slide 4 for some discussion on our segments. In the second quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 33% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income is 5.9% of revenue. 
While our Specialized Services group exceeded our expectations from a revenue standpoint, most of the outperformance was driven by Materials Technology group. Gains in this group were offset by continued design investments in our healthcare business and weakness in our Aftermarket Services group, where an internal site transition negatively impacted both revenue and segment profitability for the quarter by some 40 to 50 basis points. We expect this transition to be resolved and operating performance within our Aftermarket Services group to return to previous historical levels in the upcoming quarter.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue and core operating income for the segment was 1.7% revenue. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure performance remained below our previous expectations as a result of continued end market weakness across our telecoms and networking customer base. I shall provide more color towards the end of my prepared remarks on our plans to return this segment to within our long-term operating range targets.
Our High Velocity segment once again operated very efficiently during the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 10% on a year-over-year basis and represents an approximately 20% -- 27%, excuse me, total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 4% of revenue. The sequential and year-over-year margin outperformance in this segment is primarily associated with a more favorable mix of product. 
For the second straight quarter, we have 110% customer in each of those 3 segments. While our top 10 customers comprise 61.8% of revenue in the fiscal quarter.
If you now turn to Slide 5, I will review some of our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the quarter, we've cash balances of $707 million. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Telmar for $128 million in cash on the 1st of December. And during the course of the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares with an average price of $22.73 per share or approximately $40 million. There was little impact to EPS for the quarter as a result of these repurchases. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP return on investment capital expanded by 2% to 22% in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
EBITDA for the same period expanded by $45 million to $535 million or 6.2%, while cash flows from operations was $5 million. 
Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $77 million or $180 million in the first half of the year.
In the quarter, inventory decreased by 1% to  $2.35 billion, and inventory turns remained at 7. Cash used in operations for the quarter was $109 million as a result of a more nonlinear quarter than we previously anticipated, causing average and period and working capital levels to be elevated. We expect working capital levels to return to within recent historical ranges in the coming quarter, and as a result, a return to positive operating cash flows in both our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
I'm also pleased to announce that we have recently amended our bank revolver, adding capacity of $300 million to a total of $1.3 billion and extending this facility into 2017. This continues to provide us flexibility in our capital structure as we continue to position the company for growth in 2013 and beyond.
You should now turn to Slide 6. We're pleased with our second quarter's results. Core operating margin performance was 4.2%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were at the high end of our range. Both core and GAAP EPS also is at the midpoint of our guidance.
If you now turn to Slide 8, 9 and 10. I would like to discuss the upcoming third quarter's guidance. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 2% in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Core operating income is estimated to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million. Core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%.
Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
This is based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. And based upon the current estimate to production, our tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18%.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25% as a result of growth across all areas within this segment. On a sequential basis, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to grow modestly at 2% as we commence product transitions and additional capital investments in our Manufacturing Technologies group. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 8% on a year-over-year basis, slight declines in networking and telecommunications product set, offset by growth in storage. On a sequential basis, the segment is expected to grow 5%, with growth across networking, storage and telecommunications.
And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 14% on a year-over-year basis as a result of continued declines in handset volumes, offset by growth in automotive, point-of-sale printing and our set-top box business.
Capital expenditures in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be approximately $320 million. Majority of this investment is associated with continued investments in our Materials Technology group, group's capacity and capabilities. 
Total capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are now expected to be approximately $500 million with an excess of 75% of these expenditures being invested in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, positioning this segment for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'd now like to ask you to turn to Slide 11 for a discussion on our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment operating margin performance. This slide shows 2 charts, the top being expected operating margin progression in the upcoming quarter and the bottom, progression of a return to 4% operating margins in this segment during the first fiscal quarter of 2013 or 9 months from now. 
We expect the operating margin performance in our third fiscal quarter to improve by some 70 basis points, 25 basis points coming from both the growth in revenues in networking, program wins and product launch and storage and a recovery to growth in the telecommunications sector. The sites we acquired in France and Italy during fiscal '11 and targeted overhead reductions shall contribute 10 basis points each or 0.1% each.
Turning to the chart at the bottom of the slide. We have line of sight to return to growth over the balance of calendar 2012, with revenue growth in storage and networking contributing 1% and 0.35% telecoms revenue growth. Sites in France and Italy are expected to contribute 0.3% through the addition of revenues and cost reduction programs, while targeted overhead reductions across this segment shall yield an additional 0.65%, returning this segment to 4% operating margin performance.
With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment and growth by business group, and also for the first time, provide you some perspective on how we're thinking about fiscal year '13.
If you please turn to Slide 13. Our Materials Technology group is really about ingenuity and innovation, and we have invested for growth both in 2010, 2011, 2012, and we expect further growth in 2013. Typically from the investment of CapEx there's a lag time of approximately 3 to 6 months as we install the equipment, begin production and manage to higher levels of expected yields in that 4 to 6 month period, currently managing through significant expansion of our capacity and introducing new product families across a broad range of customers. We're very bullish on another great year of growth, and we expect over $3 billion -- roughly $3 billion in fiscal year '12 and hope to grow to approximately $4 billion in FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 14. In our Healthcare & Life Sciences business, Jabil is really a safe pair of hands. We pursue business in essentially 6 modalities: patient bedside, portable on- and in-body, surgical or procedural devices, analytical lab equipment, imaging and single-use devices. We're very proud of the customer base that we have and we've spent a lot of time developing new relationships over the last few years. 
Although there was roughly a flat year of growth in fiscal year '12, we do expect that rate of growth to accelerate as we enter FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 15. This rate of growth is expected to accelerate through the pipeline of growth, particularly to this large portfolio of products that are in our design labs today, which will be introduced to production over the course of fiscal '12 and fiscal '13, and we have well over 20 design wins in this healthcare business area. And we're very happy that when those products go into manufacturing, they tend to have -- typically have a 10-year average product life cycle. This leads to very sustained growth and gives us a great deal of confidence that our fiscal year '13 and '14 revenue growth should be at the top end of our 20% to 30% revenue guidance for the Diversified Manufacturing Services area.
Turn to Slide 16, please. In Industrial & Clean Tech market, we're really about solving global complexity and enabling innovation. We have business in energy generation, infrastructure, heavy machinery, light goods and a broad range of industrial products. We have some of the leading companies in the world as our customers, spanning activity from smart metering to agriculture, light goods and other types of Clean Tech areas.
Turning to Slide 17, please. We really are developing a global expertise that simplifies complexity. This is really a very high-mixed business. Nearly 50% of Jabil's industrial energy manufacturing is in lot sizes of 50 or less. And remember that Jabil's business, overall, Jabil builds about 70% of its output in lot quantities of 100 or less.  We need to have very advanced planning tools, techniques to optimize production for these customers and we have very high performance, standardized inter-plant product transfer process for business continuity and low transfer costs. We're very excited about continued growth in the Industrial & Clean Tech area.
Please turn to Slide 18. We're enjoying continued success of our core depot repair activity in the Aftermarket Services area, and we are seeing additional growth in worldwide parts fulfillment, developing new capabilities that are really taking off now, including diagnostics, distributed screening and customer-facing activities. And we expect our growth in Aftermarket Services to continue to be 15% to 20% on an organic basis. 
Taking our Diversified Manufacturing Services group in total as we look at fiscal year '13, I see growth in our High Velocity area of approximately 0%; in Enterprise & Infrastructure, 10%; and then you can see in Industrial & Clean Tech, Healthcare & Instrumentation and Aftermarket Services, we think these businesses can grow year-over-year on a 15% basis.
Materials Technology Group, as I've mentioned previously, now we expect to have another very robust year growth. Now this will easily support 10% to 15% growth in our fiscal year '13, and we're very excited about our prospects on a longer-term basis. 
I think we've spent a lot of time focusing on the short term, and we're very pleased with how our business is coming together from a long-term basis and looking forward in FY '13, '14 and '15 and seeing continued growth of 10% to 15%."

Revenue wo",461,"Okay. In terms of Materials Technology Group investments, the slide that we developed and included in our presentation is, yes, Slide 13, is intended to give investors an idea of the lag time between capital investment in the advent of revenue. Revenue would typically commence approximately 3, 4, 5 months after the investment, and we'd expect to ramp into production through months 4, 5 and 6 and get to more mature yield levels and profitability levels by approximately the 6th month. We're going through our product transition now with new product families that are ramping. We'll be doing that over the course of the spring and summer and making some significant investments. So I would expect the margins in the Materials Technology Group to continue to be in the expected ranges. They'll certainly be better when you reach mature levels of production, a little bit on the lower side during periods of product transitions, but still within the targeted range. It's getting to be a very big business obviously. In half year it commenced -- we're looking at $1.5 billion per 6-month period pace in fiscal '12 moving to $2 billion or more half year pace in fiscal year '13. So we're very pleased with how that business is coming together, and we are adding capacity as we speak. In terms of the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, there's not a whole heck of a lot to report, Steve, except that revenue was a little bit lower than expected. And we think it's important to really focus on how we get back to 4% from where we are today. And I think we have a good line of sight. My own -- when I look at this business, there has been a very significant slowdown in overall Enterprise & Infrastructure spending from the spring of 2011 when the European debt crisis first emerged, a lot of caution throughout the summer. And as the U.S. had its debt crisis, government spending has been on the decline. That has impacted some of our higher-end government-related types of products. 2,500 spending had collapsed in certain areas of Asia. All of those provided significant headwinds over the last few quarters. My experience having been in the business as long as I have is that you have these periods of under-investment, a little bit of excess inventory, people work through those, and then spending starts to pick up. So provided that the U.S., particularly the U.S. market, continues to be stable and grow even at a lower rate, I would expect IT Enterprise-related spending to start to pick up midyear and show some more normal levels of at least secular growth rate of 5% to 10% as we exit fiscal '12 and begin our fiscal year '13."

We are seeing a sequential uptick of 5 points this coming 90-day period. And we don't see any a little bit of tailwind to include -- to be better than that. But we feel pretty comfortable that the telecommunications business, we're starting to see some pickup there. I think as we articulated before, we had some wins in the wireless area there over the 2 quarters, and we're starting see that pick up again, which is good news as we move through the back of calendar '12."

In '10, it was significantly below the targeted range. In '11, it was near the bottom of the range. And in both cases, recovered to the 6.5% to 7% areas.

We've been operating at that level for the past few years as well, so there's some historical basis for that. I think when we look at Healthcare and Life Sciences, one of the things that we try to highlight is the many, many design wins, the integration of design, our Materials Technology Group and single-use devices, our optics capability and integrating all of those capabilities into a very broad portfolio of new products that will come out of our product development labs over the next 12 to 18 months and contribute significantly to an acceleration of growth in our Healthcare & Instrumentation area. When I look at Industrial & Clean Tech, although a lot of people talk about it, I don't think that our competitors have the diversity and capability that we do. I think we build high-mix electronics in more low-cost locations than anybody else in the world. And when you consider Jabil's -- we'll be in the mid-$17 billion range this year or at least above $17 billion of revenue this year, and 70% of that output is built from lot quantities of 100 or less. We are the largest high-mix manufacturing business on the planet, and we think that's a very highly differentiated capability to bring to a market. In a world where virtually all customers are efforting to get to new places, new locations, tap growth in emerging markets, bring new technologies to the products that they have in their portfolio, leverage our product development skills, so helping our customer base manage through that global complexity of architecting -- helping them architect global supply-chain networks is a significant differentiator."

In Enterprise & Infrastructure, my sense is that the mood is turning more towards optimism so I'm -- there's more bias to the upside. I think the overhang of the T-Mobile, AT&T acquisition put a cap on some needed infrastructure spend in North America. The collapse of 2,500 in China and some of the economic slowdown or worry about economic slowdown in Asia put a kind of a cap on spend there. And of course, we have Europe that's in the midst of a recession. My sense is that most of the inventory issues had been worked through, and that we'll see an expansion of spend as some of the uncertainties have cleared down over the last 3 or 4 months. And then as people get progressive -- they've kind of know how the macroeconomic environment does, but as long as it stays in a state of even lackluster growth, I think that the bias is more towards the upside. Diversified Manufacturing Services is just going crazy. I mean we've got great growth there. We've had great there, and we expect to continue to have great growth there. So our customers are happy with our performance. We're happy with our customers, and we feel like we can continue to grow that at a world-class pace. And High Velocity, that's not an area where we look for a lot of great growth, but we have significant customer relationships there. And you know what, Craig, we're getting pretty good at it. And in High Velocity to -- I don't think we'll continue to earn 4% operating margins in High Velocity. I would expect this Enterprise & Infrastructure margins improve. We might see High Velocity move into the mid-3s because we do need to support customers. It's a very competitive business. But that said, we've really been able to use lean manufacturing and consolidate our operations around the world and get our customers into fewer sites and drive a lot of efficiency that way. So we're very happy with our performance in that area. I don't think the consumer spend has been great across the board, but it's been okay, and our customers there are doing pretty well.

As Forbes said, there's a very straightforward reason in Aftermarket Services, why we have confidence that will recover. I think the brighter -- the more interesting part of the story is looking at FY '13 and the growth of the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. If you take from what we've shown you on Slide 19 overall, Diversified Manufacturing Services is expected to grow at 22% in FY '13. Overall, that drives about a 12% to 13% growth for the company when you consider Enterprise & Infrastructure. And if you just look at our margin mix generally speaking, with Diversified Manufacturing Services conservatively in the 6.5% range and then more normalized margins in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure should be a great year for us. So I really think that's the more interesting part of the story. As we go quarter-to-quarter, in these [indiscernible] areas are relatively arbitrary. We'll have margin -- a little bit of margin variation as individual aspects of the business do better or worse. We're really happy that revenue is as strong as it was in the quarter, $4.2 billion, at the high end of the range and operating margins at the midpoint and EPS and earnings being where they should be in that environment. So that's kind of a bullish set of circumstances for us to be in today, particularly when you consider how we're doing relative to some of the other comparison in the industry that showed contraction in the December period. And we'll see how people do in the March period, but I think we're essentially doing a good job of growing the company and showing good earnings in this environment."

Our second quarter press release and corresponding webcast with slides are also available on our website. In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website and beginning with Slide 2, our forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected third quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earning results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. 
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings.
Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
And I just realized I must misspoke it, August 31, 2011, not 2012. As we indicated last quarter, we have begun to highlight GAAP operating results. While we currently are still reporting and publishing core results, it is also our intention to move fully to GAAP beginning in fiscal 2013. In addition, we will also be providing guidance on long-term year-over-year outlook. 
This change to our guidance aligns more closely with how we run the business, making strategic, long-term decisions. We believe providing guidance in this fashion gives investors the most appropriate view into our business.
Today's call will begin with our second quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander, as well as guidance on our third fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with macro-environment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from call attendees.
I'll now turn the call over to Forbes."

As you're following along, I'd like you to -- if you would turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. Our net revenue for the second quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating",1384,"Thank you, Beth. Good evening, everyone. As you're following along, I'd like you to -- if you would turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. Our net revenue for the second quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $150 million or 3.5% of revenue, which compares to $105 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $3.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in the prior year. 
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, increased 4.6% to $176.2 million and represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $168.4 million or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal quarter was $0.46, an increase of 84% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.58, an increase of 7.4% over the prior year.
If you now turn to Slide 4 for some discussion on our segments. In the second quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 33% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income is 5.9% of revenue. 
While our Specialized Services group exceeded our expectations from a revenue standpoint, most of the outperformance was driven by Materials Technology group. Gains in this group were offset by continued design investments in our healthcare business and weakness in our Aftermarket Services group, where an internal site transition negatively impacted both revenue and segment profitability for the quarter by some 40 to 50 basis points. We expect this transition to be resolved and operating performance within our Aftermarket Services group to return to previous historical levels in the upcoming quarter.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue and core operating income for the segment was 1.7% revenue. Our Enterprise & Infrastructure performance remained below our previous expectations as a result of continued end market weakness across our telecoms and networking customer base. I shall provide more color towards the end of my prepared remarks on our plans to return this segment to within our long-term operating range targets.
Our High Velocity segment once again operated very efficiently during the quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 10% on a year-over-year basis and represents an approximately 20% -- 27%, excuse me, total company revenue in the quarter. Core operating income for this segment was 4% of revenue. The sequential and year-over-year margin outperformance in this segment is primarily associated with a more favorable mix of product. 
For the second straight quarter, we have 110% customer in each of those 3 segments. While our top 10 customers comprise 61.8% of revenue in the fiscal quarter.
If you now turn to Slide 5, I will review some of our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the quarter, we've cash balances of $707 million. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Telmar for $128 million in cash on the 1st of December. And during the course of the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares with an average price of $22.73 per share or approximately $40 million. There was little impact to EPS for the quarter as a result of these repurchases. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP return on investment capital expanded by 2% to 22% in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
EBITDA for the same period expanded by $45 million to $535 million or 6.2%, while cash flows from operations was $5 million. 
Our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $77 million or $180 million in the first half of the year.
In the quarter, inventory decreased by 1% to  $2.35 billion, and inventory turns remained at 7. Cash used in operations for the quarter was $109 million as a result of a more nonlinear quarter than we previously anticipated, causing average and period and working capital levels to be elevated. We expect working capital levels to return to within recent historical ranges in the coming quarter, and as a result, a return to positive operating cash flows in both our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
I'm also pleased to announce that we have recently amended our bank revolver, adding capacity of $300 million to a total of $1.3 billion and extending this facility into 2017. This continues to provide us flexibility in our capital structure as we continue to position the company for growth in 2013 and beyond.
You should now turn to Slide 6. We're pleased with our second quarter's results. Core operating margin performance was 4.2%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were at the high end of our range. Both core and GAAP EPS also is at the midpoint of our guidance.
If you now turn to Slide 8, 9 and 10. I would like to discuss the upcoming third quarter's guidance. We expect revenue in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 2% in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Core operating income is estimated to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and to be in the range of $185 million to $205 million. Core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%.
Our core earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
This is based upon a diluted share count of 213 million shares. And based upon the current estimate to production, our tax rate on core operating income is expected to be 18%.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 25% as a result of growth across all areas within this segment. On a sequential basis, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to grow modestly at 2% as we commence product transitions and additional capital investments in our Manufacturing Technologies group. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 8% on a year-over-year basis, slight declines in networking and telecommunications product set, offset by growth in storage. On a sequential basis, the segment is expected to grow 5%, with growth across networking, storage and telecommunications.
And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 14% on a year-over-year basis as a result of continued declines in handset volumes, offset by growth in automotive, point-of-sale printing and our set-top box business.
Capital expenditures in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be approximately $320 million. Majority of this investment is associated with continued investments in our Materials Technology group, group's capacity and capabilities. 
Total capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are now expected to be approximately $500 million with an excess of 75% of these expenditures being invested in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, positioning this segment for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'd now like to ask you to turn to Slide 11 for a discussion on our Enterprise & Infrastructure segment operating margin performance. This slide shows 2 charts, the top being expected operating margin progression in the upcoming quarter and the bottom, progression of a return to 4% operating margins in this segment during the first fiscal quarter of 2013 or 9 months from now. 
We expect the operating margin performance in our third fiscal quarter to improve by some 70 basis points, 25 basis points coming from both the growth in revenues in networking, program wins and product launch and storage and a recovery to growth in the telecommunications sector. The sites we acquired in France and Italy during fiscal '11 and targeted overhead reductions shall contribute 10 basis points each or 0.1% each.
Turning to the chart at the bottom of the slide. We have line of sight to return to growth over the balance of calendar 2012, with revenue growth in storage and networking contributing 1% and 0.35% telecoms revenue growth. Sites in France and Italy are expected to contribute 0.3% through the addition of revenues and cost reduction programs, while targeted overhead reductions across this segment shall yield an additional 0.65%, returning this segment to 4% operating margin performance.
With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment and growth by business group, and also for the first time, provide you some perspective on how we're thinking about fiscal year '13.If you pleas",767,"Thank you, Forbes. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment and growth by business group, and also for the first time, provide you some perspective on how we're thinking about fiscal year '13.
If you please turn to Slide 13. Our Materials Technology group is really about ingenuity and innovation, and we have invested for growth both in 2010, 2011, 2012, and we expect further growth in 2013. Typically from the investment of CapEx there's a lag time of approximately 3 to 6 months as we install the equipment, begin production and manage to higher levels of expected yields in that 4 to 6 month period, currently managing through significant expansion of our capacity and introducing new product families across a broad range of customers. We're very bullish on another great year of growth, and we expect over $3 billion -- roughly $3 billion in fiscal year '12 and hope to grow to approximately $4 billion in FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 14. In our Healthcare & Life Sciences business, Jabil is really a safe pair of hands. We pursue business in essentially 6 modalities: patient bedside, portable on- and in-body, surgical or procedural devices, analytical lab equipment, imaging and single-use devices. We're very proud of the customer base that we have and we've spent a lot of time developing new relationships over the last few years. 
Although there was roughly a flat year of growth in fiscal year '12, we do expect that rate of growth to accelerate as we enter FY '13.
Please turn to Slide 15. This rate of growth is expected to accelerate through the pipeline of growth, particularly to this large portfolio of products that are in our design labs today, which will be introduced to production over the course of fiscal '12 and fiscal '13, and we have well over 20 design wins in this healthcare business area. And we're very happy that when those products go into manufacturing, they tend to have -- typically have a 10-year average product life cycle. This leads to very sustained growth and gives us a great deal of confidence that our fiscal year '13 and '14 revenue growth should be at the top end of our 20% to 30% revenue guidance for the Diversified Manufacturing Services area.
Turn to Slide 16, please. In Industrial & Clean Tech market, we're really about solving global complexity and enabling innovation. We have business in energy generation, infrastructure, heavy machinery, light goods and a broad range of industrial products. We have some of the leading companies in the world as our customers, spanning activity from smart metering to agriculture, light goods and other types of Clean Tech areas.
Turning to Slide 17, please. We really are developing a global expertise that simplifies complexity. This is really a very high-mixed business. Nearly 50% of Jabil's industrial energy manufacturing is in lot sizes of 50 or less. And remember that Jabil's business, overall, Jabil builds about 70% of its output in lot quantities of 100 or less.  We need to have very advanced planning tools, techniques to optimize production for these customers and we have very high performance, standardized inter-plant product transfer process for business continuity and low transfer costs. We're very excited about continued growth in the Industrial & Clean Tech area.
Please turn to Slide 18. We're enjoying continued success of our core depot repair activity in the Aftermarket Services area, and we are seeing additional growth in worldwide parts fulfillment, developing new capabilities that are really taking off now, including diagnostics, distributed screening and customer-facing activities. And we expect our growth in Aftermarket Services to continue to be 15% to 20% on an organic basis. 
Taking our Diversified Manufacturing Services group in total as we look at fiscal year '13, I see growth in our High Velocity area of approximately 0%; in Enterprise & Infrastructure, 10%; and then you can see in Industrial & Clean Tech, Healthcare & Instrumentation and Aftermarket Services, we think these businesses can grow year-over-year on a 15% basis.
Materials Technology Group, as I've mentioned previously, now we expect to have another very robust year growth. Now this will easily support 10% to 15% growth in our fiscal year '13, and we're very excited about our prospects on a longer-term basis. 
I think we've spent a lot of time focusing on the short term, and we're very pleased with how our business is coming together from a long-term basis and looking forward in FY '13, '14 and '15 and seeing continued growth of 10% to 15%."

Revenue wo",461,"Okay. In terms of Materials Technology Group investments, the slide that we developed and included in our presentation is, yes, Slide 13, is intended to give investors an idea of the lag time between capital investment in the advent of revenue. Revenue would typically commence approximately 3, 4, 5 months after the investment, and we'd expect to ramp into production through months 4, 5 and 6 and get to more mature yield levels and profitability levels by approximately the 6th month. We're going through our product transition now with new product families that are ramping. We'll be doing that over the course of the spring and summer and making some significant investments. So I would expect the margins in the Materials Technology Group to continue to be in the expected ranges. They'll certainly be better when you reach mature levels of production, a little bit on the lower side during periods of product transitions, but still within the targeted range. It's getting to be a very big business obviously. In half year it commenced -- we're looking at $1.5 billion per 6-month period pace in fiscal '12 moving to $2 billion or more half year pace in fiscal year '13. So we're very pleased with how that business is coming together, and we are adding capacity as we speak. In terms of the Enterprise & Infrastructure area, there's not a whole heck of a lot to report, Steve, except that revenue was a little bit lower than expected. And we think it's important to really focus on how we get back to 4% from where we are today. And I think we have a good line of sight. My own -- when I look at this business, there has been a very significant slowdown in overall Enterprise & Infrastructure spending from the spring of 2011 when the European debt crisis first emerged, a lot of caution throughout the summer. And as the U.S. had its debt crisis, government spending has been on the decline. That has impacted some of our higher-end government-related types of products. 2,500 spending had collapsed in certain areas of Asia. All of those provided significant headwinds over the last few quarters. My experience having been in the business as long as I have is that you have these periods of under-investment, a little bit of excess inventory, people work through those, and then spending starts to pick up. So provided that the U.S., particularly the U.S. market, continues to be stable and grow even at a lower rate, I would expect IT Enterprise-related spending to start to pick up midyear and show some more normal levels of at least secular growth rate of 5% to 10% as we exit fiscal '12 and begin our fiscal year '13."

In terms of overall revenue, what I -- getting the guidance for the full second half of the year, it's somewhere in the region of $210 million, or $250 million, something of that nature. We are seeing a sequential uptick of 5 points this coming 90-day period. And we don't see any a little bit of tailwind to include -- to be better than that. But we feel pretty comfortable that the telecommunications business, we're starting to see some pickup there.

In Enterprise & Infrastructure, my sense is that the mood is turning more towards optimism so I'm -- there's more bias to the upside. I think the overhang of the T-Mobile, AT&T acquisition put a cap on some needed infrastructure spend in North America. The collapse of 2,500 in China and some of the economic slowdown or worry about economic slowdown in Asia put a kind of a cap on spend there. And of course, we have Europe that's in the midst of a recession. My sense is that most of the inventory issues had been worked through, and that we'll see an expansion of spend as some of the uncertainties have cleared down over the last 3 or 4 months. And then as people get progressive -- they've kind of know how the macroeconomic environment does, but as long as it stays in a state of even lackluster growth, I think that the bias is more towards the upside. Diversified Manufacturing Services is just going crazy. I mean we've got great growth there. We've had great there, and we expect to continue to have great growth there. So our customers are happy with our performance. We're happy with our customers, and we feel like we can continue to grow that at a world-class pace. And High Velocity, that's not an area where we look for a lot of great growth, but we have significant customer relationships there. And you know what, Craig, we're getting pretty good at it. And in High Velocity to -- I don't think we'll continue to earn 4% operating margins in High Velocity. I would expect this Enterprise & Infrastructure margins improve. We might see High Velocity move into the mid-3s because we do need to support customers. It's a very competitive business. But that said, we've really been able to use lean manufacturing and consolidate our operations around the world and get our customers into fewer sites and drive a lot of efficiency that way. So we're very happy with our performance in that area. I don't think the consumer spend has been great across the board, but it's been okay, and our customers there are doing pretty well. So I would say we're getting progressively more optimistic than the way things looked 3 or 4 months ago."

As Forbes said, there's a very straightforward reason in Aftermarket Services, why we have confidence that will recover. I think the brighter -- the more interesting part of the story is looking at FY '13 and the growth of the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. If you take from what we've shown you on Slide 19 overall, Diversified Manufacturing Services is expected to grow at 22% in FY '13. Overall, that drives about a 12% to 13% growth for the company when you consider Enterprise & Infrastructure. And if you just look at our margin mix generally speaking, with Diversified Manufacturing Services conservatively in the 6.5% range and then more normalized margins in High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure should be a great year for us. So I really think that's the more interesting part of the story. As we go quarter-to-quarter, in these [indiscernible] areas are relatively arbitrary. We'll have margin -- a little bit of margin variation as individual aspects of the business do better or worse. We're really happy that revenue is as strong as it was in the quarter, $4.2 billion, at the high end of the range and operating margins at the midpoint and EPS and earnings being where they should be in that environment. So that's kind of a bullish set of circumstances for us to be in today, particularly when you consider how we're doing relative to some of the other comparison in the industry that showed contraction in the December period. And we'll see how people do in the March period, but I think we're essentially doing a good job of growing the company and showing good earnings in this environment."

The EBITDA margin of 6.2% and we're looking at margin -- additional margin expansion in FY '13, CapEx could be another $500 million.

During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 net revenue and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call will begin with our third quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander on the results as well as guidance on our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. Tim Main will follow with some macroenvironment and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We'll then open it up to questions from our call attendees.

Our net revenue for the third quarter was $4.25 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a year-over-year basis.

Our net revenue for the third quarter was $4.25 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $156.6 million or 3.7% of revenue, which compares to $152.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.28 billion, with 3.6% in the same period the prior year.
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a distressed customer charge, increased 7.1% to $190.3 million and represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $177.8 million or 4.2% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.64, an increase of 10.3% over the prior year.
Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by $10.1 million during the quarter as a result of a distressed customer charge taken associated with the solar industry. The solar industry today operates in a difficult environment, with much uncertainty and continuing trade disputes with China. We are at significantly lower levels of production than we were in fiscal '11. We anticipate volumes in fiscal '13 to be somewhat similar. And although the demand environment is not robust, we do not anticipate any further charges.
I would ask you to refer to Slide 4 for a discussion of our segments. In the third quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 22% on a year-over-year basis. Driven largely by strength in our Specialized Services sector. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded 70 basis points to 6.5% of revenue. Revenue in the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis, while exceeding our expectations in the quarter. The quarter saw strength in storage due to a large program ramp as a result of customer consolidation activity in our favor. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue. Core operating income for this segment expanded by 50 basis points sequentially to 2.2% of revenue. The High Velocity segment decreased 20%, excuse me, on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Excluding our handset business, High Velocity is performing very well, as evidenced by year-over-year gains in set-top box, point-of-sale, printing and other motive. As a result of this mix, core operating income for the segment remained above our expectations at 3.7% of revenue.
During the quarter, there was only one 10% customer presiding in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, while our top 10 customers comprise to 60.2%. I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5 while I review some of our balance sheet and cash metrics.
We're pleased with our working capital and operating cash flow performance in the quarter. Sales cycle improved by 3 days sequentially, inventory turns remained at 7, while cash flow generated from operations was $186 million. At the end of the quarter was cash balances of $742 million. During the quarter, we repurchased some 1.5 million shares, with the value of approximately $30 million. There was no impact to reported earnings per share in the quarter as a result of these repurchases. And $30 million remains outstanding on our current stock repurchase program.
EBITDA in the quarter expanded to $275 million, or 6.5% of revenue, the highest level since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. Our net capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $108 million. As I indicated in our March earnings call, we continue to expect capital expenditure levels for the second half of this fiscal year to be approximately $320 million. The majority of these expenditures, the targeted within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically associated with rapidly expanding capacity in our Specialized Services sector. As we exit the year, we should have doubled our square footage in Guizhou, China and have recently signed an agreement to establish a site in Chengdu, China. The ultimate available capacity up to the size of our Wuxi operations. The first phase of this expansion was scheduled to be completed during our first fiscal quarter of 2013.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a summary, excuse me, of the quarter's performance. We're pleased with the operating performance in our third fiscal quarter. Core operating margin performance was 4.5%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were below the midpoint of the range provided. Core operating income expanded 30 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, while EBITDA expanded 30 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our return on invested capital calculated on a GAAP net to income basis was 19%, while 24% on a core basis.
Finally, I ask you to refer to Slides 8 and 9, where I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.35 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4.1% to 4.6%. Our core earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.66 per diluted share. And GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.55 per diluted share. This is based upon our diluted share count of approximately 212 million shares.
Based upon the current estimate of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be in the low- to mid-20% range for the fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting a higher proportion of anticipated income from higher tax rate geographies.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 17%. In the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 5% and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 22% on a year-over-year basis. Thank you. I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

In the short term, we are managing through a period with many changes happening simultaneously. It is well documented that our mobility customer and the High Velocity sector has been under duress as they have grappled with declining sales and leadership changes while making preparations for a critical launch of an important new product platform. This customers publicly articulated their intent to drive higher performance and drive greater efficiency in their supply chain to consolidation of fewer, high capability suppliers. Jabil has been selected as the go-forward partner and we expect to consolidate production regionally in Mexico and Hungary over the next quarter or 2. Future levels of production will be highly dependent on a number of factors within and outside our control. However, we expect our total revenue with this customer, while we remain below the 10% level in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 and throughout fiscal 2013.
In order to support a number of new customers and rising demand, we are in the midst of a large-scale capacity expansion for Diversified Manufacturing Services. In addition to expanding existing sites, we have also broken ground in a new site in Chengdu, China. This new site is capable of supporting up to 2 million square feet of manufacturing capacity intended for our Specialized Services and other EMS business areas. Production from the new site is expected to commence by the end of this calendar year. Margins in our Enterprise & Infrastructure sector expanded 50 basis points sequentially, as revenue increased 8%. While we expect revenue to be stable to slightly higher sequentially for the next several quarters, our expectations for growth are more muted now than 90 days ago. Counterbalancing that lesser end markets, we have earned additional market share with several customers and experienced inefficiencies in ramping production on incoming transfers over the course of our third fiscal quarter. These inefficiencies are expected to continue through at least part of FQ 4 before we chain the production efficiency in FQ 1 of '13. In addition to ramping up new programs, we would look to cost reduction actions in order to return margins to our long-term targeted range.
Excluding our mobility customer in High Velocity, the balance of our High Velocity business is actually growing at acceptable return levels. Excluding the aforementioned mobility customer, we expect balance High Velocity revenue and income to increase over 15% in FY '12 over FY '11. While High Velocity is not a targeted growth area for Jabil, it does underscore that Jabil continues to be a cost-effective, trustworthy name for attractive customers in this business area. We are fast, flexible and competitive and we have the ability to compete in more ways and in more theaters than most of our competitors. The integration of our Telmar acquisition continues in our aftermarket Services business. Additionally, AMS is invading a number of new multicountry, multi-leader service strategies that are generating solid organic growth. The Telmar integration and the launch of these new service offerings or specific customers has had a negative impact on profit levels in FQ3 and is expected to show modest improvement in FQ4 of 2012. We look for AMS to lead the industry in innovation and service and for Jabil AMS to continue to widen the fleet over the competition. Moving from the present to the future, we believe 2012 will be our third consecutive record year even though it will close on a more subdued note than we anticipated earlier this year. Jabil's building and grooming the business for strong income growth for years to come. Investments and Specialized Services, Health Care & Industrial, along with a sustained competitive position in traditional markets should lead to continuing high-quality growth and revenue and earnings for years to come.
In reality, superior long-term performance should be expected at Jabil. For example as of 2011, there were 163 Fortune 500 companies with revenue over $16 billion a year. Not a single one of them posted higher both in revenue, EBITDA and GAAP EPS than Jabil over the 17-year period since we went public in 1994. And since 2008, only 5 have reported higher growth than Jabil: Apple, Intel and 3 financial institutions: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Prudential. Finally, for the 10-year period from fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2011, Jabil has posted a GAAP EPS, compound annual growth rate of 11.5%. There's always room for improvement, but that's not a bad track record considering all the changes that have occurred over the past 10 years.

I think we are -- I think in terms of how you should look at this, Amit, the rest of the analyst community going forward, I think the granularity on revenue will be more difficult, particularly in short-term time horizons.

I mean, we're delighted that even in a period where there's such macro uncertainty and lack of end market tailwinds that we've got Diversified Manufacturing Services, which we intend to rely on for our primary growth engine for the next 4, 5 years, growing within our targeted range of 20% to 30%. And I think the estimate is, right around will be 25% for the full year, based on where we've guided. So I think that's pretty good. I -- what we talked about in the Analyst Meeting might be useful to reiterate a little bit. Healthcare & Industrial grew at a slower rate this year. I think we've reviewed that actually at the beginning of the year, at the outset of the year that we think this would be the year in which we grow 7% to 8%. That may not be exactly that based on Q4 but the slower growth year, but with the pipeline of new product development opportunities, particularly in healthcare, we highlighted 20 to 21, 22, important new programs in health care, along with industrial, I think the SAG and solar demand as attenuated to growth in industrial actually had some very important new customer wins and program transfers and industrial. So while I look forward in FY '13, I think you'll see industrial and health care grow at a much healthier clip, much closer to the low end of the 20% to 30% range. And we may choose to supplement that in certain areas with an acquisition sometime in the close of this fiscal year or early next year."

In fact, some customers are actually expecting some revenue growth. I think earlier this year, Steven, we were talking -- we were thinking that the second half of calendar 2012 would be a little bit more robust, Enterprise & Infrastructure customers just because the spending levels have been so low. And typically, what we see is a pattern of underinvestment and in a macroenvironment that has at least some growth, that spending tends to bounce back and there's a catch-up period. I think that's going to happen again. I mean, that the Enterprise & Infrastructure spending is necessary, strategic, important. I think the fiscal constraints that governments are in all around the world has resulted in very low levels of federal spending, government spending in big corporations are risk-averse right now. So I think spend rates have slowed down a little bit. Basically we have a bottom and rebound. And man, are we -- talked with customers in that area. So we will definitely outperform when that bounces back. It's really on the margin a little bit. Again, we expect sequential revenue growth. We have won some new business in the Enterprise infrastructure area. Got a little bit of difficulty transferring them into our facilities but we'll get through that over the course of Q4. Let's say in terms of any helpful color, storage has been a great business area for us and continues to be, that's probably lead in terms of being a robust business area for Jabil. That continues to be a good area for us. But we have great customers in networking and the telecom area as well. You mentioned Chengdu, I need to tread softly there because I can't highlight customers. That would, that would preview individual customers, supply chain strategies and we're not ready to do that and that's consistent with the company's long-term policy. So I'm not doing anything that's out of character for us, but you can bet they're sizable customers with significant requirements and we will -- we intend to be in production by the end of this calendar year. But we can put traditional business in Chengdu. We can put Specialized Services, AMS business, MTG business, all kinds of businesses in Chengdu. It is not being done as a -- I mean, it has the secondary benefit of being a cost edge against close to China and we may be able to use it in future periods.

So even this quarter where our EPS and revenue levels were a little bit mixed, our margins were outstanding. And as Diversified Manufacturing Services continues to grow as a percentage of overall business, I think our margin profile will continue to be attractive but there is a 4.1% of the low-end and it's tough to kind of handicap in the what got some outsized scenarios could happen over the fourth quarter, but if we require quite a few of those downside risk to align together and -- then that's possible.

We believe that if you do business with the customer and they rely on you for a set of services, you should continue to do that through good times and bad. It's a fundamental premise of being in our business. Our customers rely on us to provide, in many cases, 100% of their manufacturing supply chain infrastructure. They cannot deliver products without us. So to the extent that you have a rational economic model and rational risk/reward embedded in contractual agreements and the rest of that kind of staff stuff, there's no reason never to walk away from that customer. And so I think that people talk about stock how they trade trait sometimes more than they think about what makes up a good customer and what doesn't. And we'll see where this goes. But we think that continuing to be a supplier in this regard and enjoy the benefit of that relationship and the investment that's being made in the relationship and the opportunity to continue in production and have adequate returns and a balance between risk and reward is much better for our company and much better for our shareholders then walking away from it."

These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.

Our net revenue for the third quarter was $4.25 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $156.6 million or 3.7% of revenue, which compares to $152.5 mil",1021,"Thanks, Beth. Hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Our net revenue for the third quarter was $4.25 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $156.6 million or 3.7% of revenue, which compares to $152.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.28 billion or 3.6% in the same period the prior year.
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a distressed customer charge, increased 7.1% to $190.3 million and represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $177.8 million or 4.2% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.48, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.64, an increase of 10.3% over the prior year.
Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by $10.1 million during the quarter as the result of a distressed customer charge taken associated with the solar industry. The solar industry today operates in a difficult environment, with much uncertainty and continuing trade disputes with China. We are at significantly lower levels of production than we were in fiscal '11. We anticipate volumes in fiscal '13 to be somewhat similar. And although the demand environment is not robust, we do not anticipate any further charges.
Now I would ask you to refer to Slide 4 for a discussion of our segments. In the third quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 22% on a year-over-year basis, driven largely by strength in our Specialized Services sector. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded 70 basis points to 6.5% of revenue. Revenue in the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis, while exceeding our expectations in the quarter. The quarter saw strength in storage due to a large program ramp as a result of customer consolidation activity in our favor.
Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue. Core operating income for this segment expanded by 50 basis points sequentially to 2.2% of revenue. The High Velocity segment decreased 20%, excuse me, on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Excluding our handset business, High Velocity is performing very well, as evidenced by year-over-year gains in set-top box, point of sale, printing and automotive. As a result of this mix, core operating income for the segment remained above our long-term expectations at 3.7% of revenue. During the quarter, there was only one 10% customer presiding in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, while our top 10 customers comprised 60.2%.
I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5 while I review some of our balance sheet and cash metrics. We're pleased with our working capital and operating cash flow performance in the quarter. Sales cycle improved by 3 days sequentially, inventory turns remained at 7, while cash flow generated from operations was $186 million. We ended the quarter with cash balances of $742 million. During the quarter, we repurchased some 1.5 million shares with a value of approximately $30 million. There was no impact to reported earnings per share in the quarter as a result of these repurchases. And $30 million remains outstanding on our current stock repurchase program.
EBITDA in the quarter expanded to $275 million or 6.5% of revenue, the highest level since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. Our net capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $108 million. As I indicated on our March earnings call, we continue to expect capital expenditure levels for the second half of this fiscal year to be approximately $320 million. The majority of these expenditures were targeted within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically associated with rapidly expanding capacity in our Specialized Services sector. As we exit the year, we should have doubled our square footage in Wuxi, China and have recently signed an agreement to establish a site in Chengdu, China. The ultimate available capacity up to the size of our Wuxi operations. The first phase of this expansion is scheduled to be completed during our first fiscal quarter 2013.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a summary, excuse me, of the quarter's performance. We're pleased with the operating performance in our third fiscal quarter. Core operating margin performance was 4.5%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were below the midpoint of the range provided. Core operating income expanded 30 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, while EBITDA expanded 30 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our return on invested capital calculated on a GAAP net to income basis was 19%, while 24% on a core basis.
Finally, I ask you to refer to Slides 8 and 9, where I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.35 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4.1% to 4.6%. Our core earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.66 per diluted share, and GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.55 per diluted share. This is based upon our diluted share count of approximately 212 million shares.
Based upon the current estimate of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be in the low- to mid-20% range for the fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting a higher proportion of anticipated income from higher tax rate geographies.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 17%. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 5% and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 22% on a year-over-year basis.
Thank you, and I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

In the short term, we are managing through a period with many changes happening simultaneously. It is well documented that our mobility customer in the High Velocity sector has been under duress as they have grappled with declining sales and leadership changes while making preparations for a critical launch of an important new product platform.
This customer has publicly articulated their intent to drive higher performance and drive greater efficiency in their supply chain through consolidation of fewer, high-capability suppliers. Jabil has been selected as the go-forward partner and we expect to consolidate production regionally in Mexico and Hungary over the next 1 or 2 quarters. Future levels of production will be highly dependent on a number of factors within and outside of our control. However, we expect our total revenue with this customer will remain below the 10% level in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 and throughout fiscal 2013.
In order to support the number of new customers and rising demand, we are in the midst of a large-scale capacity expansion for Diversified Manufacturing Services. In addition to expanding existing sites, we have also broken ground on a new site in Chengdu, China. This new site is capable of supporting up to 2 million square feet of manufacturing capacity intended for our Specialized Services and other EMS business areas. Production from the new site is expected to commence by the end of this calendar year.
Margins in our Enterprise & Infrastructure sector expanded 50 basis points sequentially, as revenue increased 8%. While we expect revenue to be stable to slightly higher sequentially for the next several quarters, our expectations for growth are more muted now than 90 days ago. Counterbalancing lackluster end markets, we have earned additional market share with some customers and experienced inefficiencies in ramping production on incoming transfers over the course of our third fiscal quarter. These inefficiencies are expected to continue through at least part of FQ 4 before reaching the tier production efficiencies in FQ 1 of '13. In addition to ramping up new programs, we will look to take an appropriate level of cost reduction actions in order to return margins to our long-term targeted range.
Excluding our mobility customer in High Velocity, the balance of our High Velocity business is actually growing at acceptable return levels. Excluding the aforementioned mobility customer, we expect balance High Velocity revenue and income to increase over 15% in FY '12 over FY '11. While High Velocity is not a target growth area for Jabil, it does underscore that Jabil continues to be a cost-effective, trustworthy name for attractive customers in this business area. We are fast, flexible and competitive and we have the ability to compete in more ways and in more theaters than most of our competitors. Integration of our Telmar acquisition continues in our aftermarket Services business.
Additionally, AMS is innovating a number of new multi-country, multi-leader service strategies that are generating solid organic growth. The Telmar integration and the launch of these new service offerings or specific customers has had a negative impact on profit levels in FQ3 and is expected to show modest improvement in FQ4 of 2012. We look for AMS to lead the industry in innovation and service and for Jabil AMS to continue to widen it's lead over the competition.
Moving from the present to the future, we believe 2012 will be our third consecutive record year even though it will close on a more subdued note than we anticipated earlier this year. Jabil is building and grooming the business for strong income growth for years to come. Investments in Specialized Services, Health Care & Industrial, along with the sustained competitive position in traditional markets should lead to continuing high-quality growth in revenue and earnings for years to come.
In reality, superior long-term performance should be expected at Jabil. For example, as of 2011, there were 163 Fortune 500 companies with revenue over $16 billion a year. Not a single one of them posted higher growth in revenue, EBITDA and GAAP EPS than Jabil over the 17-year period since we went public in 1994. And since 2008, only 5 have reported higher growth than Jabil: Apple, Intel and 3 financial institutions: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Prudential. Finally, for the 10-year period from fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2011, Jabil has posted a GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate of 11.5%. There's always room for improvement, but that's not a bad track record considering all of the convulsive changes that have occurred over the past 10 years.

I think end markets are relatively stable, but there isn't much of a tailwind.

And I don't think it's actually that meaningful looking at it from an investor's perspective because the margin structure, the health of the customers, all that kind of stuff is just not that meaningful. I mean, we're delighted that even in a period where there's such macro uncertainty and lack of end market tailwinds that we've got Diversified Manufacturing Services, which we intend to rely on for our primary growth engine for the next 4, 5 years, growing within our targeted range of 20% to 30%. And I think the estimate is, Brian, that will be 25% for the full year, based on where we've guided. So I think that's pretty good. I -- what we talked about in the Analyst Meeting might be useful to reiterate a little bit. Healthcare & Industrial grew at a slower rate this year. I think we previewed that, actually it's the beginning of the year, the outset of the year that we think this would be the year in which we grow 7% to 8%, that may not be exactly that based on Q4 but the slower growth year. But with the pipeline of new product development opportunities, particularly in healthcare, we highlighted 20 to 21, 22 important new programs in health care, along with industrial, I think the SAG and solar demand has attenuated the growth in industrial, have actually had some very important new customer wins and program transfers in industrial. So while I look forward in FY '13, I think you'll see Industrial and Healthcare grow at a much healthier cliff, much closer to the low end of the 20% to 30% range. And we may choose to supplement that in certain areas with an acquisition some time in the close of this fiscal year or early next year."

In fact, some customers are actually expecting some revenue growth. I think earlier this year, Steven, we were thinking that the second half of calendar 2012 would be a little bit more robust enterprise & Infrastructure customers just because the spending levels have been so low. And typically, what we see is a pattern of underinvestment and in a macroenvironment that has at least some growth, that spending tends to bounce back and there's a catch-up period. I think that's going to happen again. I mean, that Enterprise & Infrastructure spending is necessary, strategic, important. I think the fiscal constraints that governments are in all around the world has resulted in very low levels of federal spending, government spending and big corporations are risk-averse right now. So I think spend rates have slowed down a little bit. Essentially that will bottom and rebound. And man, are we -- full of great customers out in that area. So we will definitely outperform when that bounces back. It's really on the margin a little bit. Again, we expect sequential revenue growth. We have won some new business in the Enterprise infrastructure area. Got a little bit of difficulty transferring them into our facilities but we'll get through that over the course of Q4. I'd say in terms of any other helpful color, storage has been a great business area for us and continues to be, that's probably lead in terms of being a robust business area for Jabil. That continues to be a good area for us. But we have great customers in networking and the telecom area as well. You mentioned Chengdu, I need to tread softly there because I can't highlight customers. That would preview individual customers, supply chain strategies and we're not in liberty to do that, and that's consistent with the company's long-term policy. So I'm not doing anything that's out of character for us, but you can bet there are sizable customers with significant requirements and we will -- we intend to be in production by the end of this calendar year. But we can put traditional business in Chengdu. We can put Specialized Services, AMS business, MTG business, all kinds of businesses in Chengdu. It is not being done as a -- I mean, it has the secondary benefit of being a cost edge against close to China and we may be able to use it in future periods.

Telmar, I'd say, that we're delighted with the acquisition overall.

They cannot deliver products without us. So to the extent that you have a rational economic model and rational risk and reward embedded in contractual agreements and the rest of that kind of stuff, there's no reason ever to walk away from a customer.

GAAP operating income was $156.6 million or 3.7% of revenue, which compares to $152.5 mil",1021,"Thanks, Beth. Hello, everyone. I ask you to refer to Slide 3. Our net revenue for the third quarter was $4.25 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $156.6 million or 3.7% of revenue, which compares to $152.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.28 billion or 3.6% in the same period the prior year.
Core operating income, excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a distressed customer charge, increased 7.1% to $190.3 million and represents 4.5% of revenue. This compares to $177.8 million or 4.2% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.48, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.64, an increase of 10.3% over the prior year.
Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by $10.1 million during the quarter as the result of a distressed customer charge taken associated with the solar industry. The solar industry today operates in a difficult environment, with much uncertainty and continuing trade disputes with China. We are at significantly lower levels of production than we were in fiscal '11. We anticipate volumes in fiscal '13 to be somewhat similar. And although the demand environment is not robust, we do not anticipate any further charges.
Now I would ask you to refer to Slide 4 for a discussion of our segments. In the third quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 22% on a year-over-year basis, driven largely by strength in our Specialized Services sector. Revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded 70 basis points to 6.5% of revenue. Revenue in the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis, while exceeding our expectations in the quarter. The quarter saw strength in storage due to a large program ramp as a result of customer consolidation activity in our favor.
Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 31% of total company revenue. Core operating income for this segment expanded by 50 basis points sequentially to 2.2% of revenue. The High Velocity segment decreased 20%, excuse me, on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Excluding our handset business, High Velocity is performing very well, as evidenced by year-over-year gains in set-top box, point of sale, printing and automotive. As a result of this mix, core operating income for the segment remained above our long-term expectations at 3.7% of revenue. During the quarter, there was only one 10% customer presiding in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, while our top 10 customers comprised 60.2%.
I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5 while I review some of our balance sheet and cash metrics. We're pleased with our working capital and operating cash flow performance in the quarter. Sales cycle improved by 3 days sequentially, inventory turns remained at 7, while cash flow generated from operations was $186 million. We ended the quarter with cash balances of $742 million. During the quarter, we repurchased some 1.5 million shares with a value of approximately $30 million. There was no impact to reported earnings per share in the quarter as a result of these repurchases. And $30 million remains outstanding on our current stock repurchase program.
EBITDA in the quarter expanded to $275 million or 6.5% of revenue, the highest level since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. Our net capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $108 million. As I indicated on our March earnings call, we continue to expect capital expenditure levels for the second half of this fiscal year to be approximately $320 million. The majority of these expenditures were targeted within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, specifically associated with rapidly expanding capacity in our Specialized Services sector. As we exit the year, we should have doubled our square footage in Wuxi, China and have recently signed an agreement to establish a site in Chengdu, China. The ultimate available capacity up to the size of our Wuxi operations. The first phase of this expansion is scheduled to be completed during our first fiscal quarter 2013.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a summary, excuse me, of the quarter's performance. We're pleased with the operating performance in our third fiscal quarter. Core operating margin performance was 4.5%, the midpoint of our guidance, while revenues were below the midpoint of the range provided. Core operating income expanded 30 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, while EBITDA expanded 30 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our return on invested capital calculated on a GAAP net to income basis was 19%, while 24% on a core basis.
Finally, I ask you to refer to Slides 8 and 9, where I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.35 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4.1% to 4.6%. Our core earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.66 per diluted share, and GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.55 per diluted share. This is based upon our diluted share count of approximately 212 million shares.
Based upon the current estimate of production, the tax rate on core operating income is expected to be in the low- to mid-20% range for the fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting a higher proportion of anticipated income from higher tax rate geographies.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 17%. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to decline 5% and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 22% on a year-over-year basis.
Thank you, and I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

It is well documented that our mobility customer in the High",782,"Thanks, Forbes. I'll make a few comments on present conditions and then longer-term perspectives. In the short term, we are managing through a period with many changes happening simultaneously. It is well documented that our mobility customer in the High Velocity sector has been under duress as they have grappled with declining sales and leadership changes while making preparations for a critical launch of an important new product platform.
This customer has publicly articulated their intent to drive higher performance and derive greater efficiency in their supply chain through consolidation of fewer, high-capability suppliers. Jabil has been selected as the go-forward partner and we expect to consolidate production regionally in Mexico and Hungary over the next 1 or 2 quarters. Future levels of production will be highly dependent on a number of factors within and outside of our control. However, we expect our total revenue with this customer will remain below the 10% level in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 and throughout fiscal 2013.
In order to support the number of new customers and rising demand, we are in the midst of a large-scale capacity expansion for Diversified Manufacturing Services. In addition to expanding existing sites, we have also broken ground on a new site in Chengdu, China. This new site is capable of supporting up to 2 million square feet of manufacturing capacity intended for our Specialized Services and other EMS business areas. Production from the new site is expected to commence by the end of this calendar year.
Margins in our Enterprise & Infrastructure sector expanded 50 basis points sequentially, as revenue increased 8%. While we expect revenue to be stable to slightly higher sequentially for the next several quarters, our expectations for growth are more muted now than 90 days ago. Counterbalancing lackluster end markets, we have earned additional market share with some customers and experienced inefficiencies in ramping production on incoming transfers over the course of our third fiscal quarter. These inefficiencies are expected to continue through at least part of FQ 4 before reaching mature production efficiencies in FQ 1 of '13. In addition to ramping up new programs, we will look to take an appropriate level of cost reduction actions in order to return margins to our long-term targeted range.
Excluding our mobility customer in High Velocity, the balance of our High Velocity business is actually growing at acceptable return levels. Excluding the aforementioned mobility customer, we expect balance High Velocity revenue and income to increase over 15% in FY '12 over FY '11. While High Velocity is not a target growth area for Jabil, it does underscore that Jabil continues to be a cost-effective, trustworthy name for attractive customers in this business area. We are fast, flexible and competitive and we have the ability to compete in more ways and in more theaters than most of our competitors. Integration of our Telmar acquisition continues in our aftermarket Services business.
Additionally, AMS is innovating a number of new multi-country, multi-leader service strategies that are generating solid organic growth. The Telmar integration and the launch of these new service offerings for specific customers has had a negative impact on profit levels in FQ3 and is expected to show modest improvement in FQ4 of 2012. We look for AMS to lead the industry in innovation and service and for Jabil AMS to continue to widen its lead over the competition.
Moving from the present to the future, we believe 2012 will be our third consecutive record year even though it will close on a more subdued note than we anticipated earlier this year. Jabil is building and grooming the business for strong income growth for years to come. Investments in Specialized Services, Health Care & Industrial, along with the sustained competitive position in traditional markets should lead to continuing high-quality growth in revenue and earnings for years to come.
In reality, superior long-term performance should be expected at Jabil. For example, as of 2011, there were 163 Fortune 500 companies with revenue over $16 billion a year. Not a single one of them posted higher growth in revenue, EBITDA and GAAP EPS than Jabil over the 17-year period since we went public in 1994. And since 2008, only 5 have reported higher growth than Jabil: Apple, Intel and 3 financial institutions: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Prudential. Finally, for the 10-year period from fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2011, Jabil has posted a GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate of 11.5%. There's always room for improvement, but that's not a bad track record considering all of the convulsive changes that have occurred over the past 10 years.

I think end markets are relatively stable, but there isn't much of a tailwind.

But I think we are -- I think in terms of how you should look at this, Amit, and the rest of the analyst community going forward, I think the granularity on revenue will be more difficult, particularly in short-term time horizons.

And I don't think it's actually that meaningful looking at it from an investor's perspective because the margin structure, the health of the customers, all that kind of stuff is just not that meaningful. I mean, we're delighted that even in a period where there's such macro uncertainty and lack of end market tailwinds that we've got Diversified Manufacturing Services, which we intend to rely on for our primary growth engine for the next 4, 5 years, growing within our targeted range of 20% to 30%. And I think the estimate is, Brian, that will be 25% for the full year, based on where we've guided. So I think that's pretty good. I -- what we talked about in the Analyst Meeting might be useful to reiterate a little bit. Healthcare & Industrial grew at a slower rate this year. I think we previewed that, actually at the beginning of the year, the outset of the year that we think this would be the year in which we grow 7% to 8%, that may not be exactly that based on Q4 but be a slower growth year. But with the pipeline of new product development opportunities, particularly in healthcare, we highlighted 20 to 21, 22 important new programs in health care, along with industrial, I think the SAG and solar demand has attenuated the growth in industrial, have actually had some very important new customer wins and program transfers in industrial. So when I look forward in FY '13, I think you'll see Industrial and Healthcare grow at a much healthier clip, much closer to the low end of the 20% to 30% range. And we may choose to supplement that in certain areas with an acquisition some time in the close of this fiscal year or early next year."

In fact, some customers are actually expecting some revenue growth. I think earlier this year, Steven, we were thinking that the second half of calendar 2012 would be a little bit more robust enterprise & Infrastructure customers just because the spending levels have been so low. And typically, what we see is a pattern of underinvestment and in a macroenvironment that has at least some growth, that spending tends to bounce back and there's a catch-up period. I think that's going to happen again. I mean, that Enterprise & Infrastructure spending is necessary, strategic, important. I think the fiscal constraints that governments are in all around the world has resulted in very low levels of federal spending, government spending and big corporations are risk-averse right now. So I think spend rates have slowed down a little bit. Eventually that will bottom and rebound. And man, are we -- full of great customers out in that area. So we will definitely outperform when that bounces back. It's really on the margin a little bit. Again, we expect sequential revenue growth. We have won some new business in the Enterprise infrastructure area. Got a little bit of difficulty transferring them into our facilities but we'll get through that over the course of Q4. I'd say in terms of any other helpful color, storage has been a great business area for us and continues to be, that's probably led in terms of being a robust business area for Jabil. That continues to be a good area for us. But we have great customers in networking and the telecom area as well. You mentioned Chengdu, I need to tread softly there because I can't highlight customers. That would preview individual customers, supply chain strategies and we're not in liberty to do that, and that's consistent with the company's long-term policy. So I'm not doing anything that's out of character for us, but you can bet there are sizable customers with significant requirements and we will -- we intend to be in production by the end of this calendar year. But we can put traditional business in Chengdu. We can put Specialized Services, AMS business, MTG business, all kinds of businesses in Chengdu. It is not being done as a -- I mean, it has the secondary benefit of being a cost edge against coastal China and we may be able to use it in future periods.

That's very helpful. We appreciate that. And I might as well just mention again, that 6.5% EBITDA is the highest level since the fourth quarter 2005, in any case. So, I mean, really it's just a matter of if revenue is far less than we though and we struggle with some of the operational challenges that we have this quarter, it could drive it to that lower level. Now we have not been at the low-end of our operating margin guidance in my flawed memory for a long time. So even this quarter where our EPS and revenue levels were a little bit mixed, our margins were outstanding. And as Diversified Manufacturing Services continues to grow as a percentage of overall business, I think our margin profile will continue to be attractive. But there is 4.1% at the low-end and it's tough to kind of handicap in the what downside scenarios could happen over the course of the quarter, but if we require quite a few of those downside risks to align together and then that's possible. Nothing in particular though. If you think about it, a particular event that we're trying to handicap in."

Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $144.2 million or 3.3% of revenue. This compares to $165.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion or 3.9% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.39.
Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a disparate consumer charge decreased 6% to $175 million, a represented 4% of revenue. This compares to $187 million or 4.4% for the same period in the prior year.
Core diluted earnings per share is $0.54, a decrease of 13% over the prior year. Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by approximately $5.9 million during the quarter as a result of charges taken connected to our Solar business. These charges were isolated with one customer. Given the very difficult industry conditions, we're operating with an abundance of caution with any solar or solar-related opportunity, with strict contractual operating agreements in place.
Now I'll ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2012, net revenue was $17.2 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income increased 7% to $622 million, representing 3.6% of revenue. This compares to $579 million of operating income on revenues of $16.5 billion. And 3.5% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.87, an 8% increase over the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and receivables and related charges increased 3% to $736 million and represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $715 million or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.40, an increase of 3% over fiscal 2011.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 5, where we will discuss our fourth quarter segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 14% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strength in Specialized Services, growth in Industrial and health care, offset by softening of demand in Defense and Aerospace and Industrial & Clean Tech. Revenue for this segment was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 45% of total company revenue. Core operating income declined in the quarter to 5.3% of revenue. Our core operating income results were negatively impacted by a challenging ramp within our Specialized Services sector and lower income levels in certain Diversified Manufacturing Services programs.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenues in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2.4%, an improvement of 20 basis points on a sequential basis. We expect to see continued positive progression during the course of fiscal 2013 with regards to operating performance.
The High Velocity segment decreased 10% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue is $1.1 billion, representing approximately 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Despite large declines in our handset business, core operating income for this segment remains 3.8% of revenue. I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our segment performance on a yearly basis.
In fiscal 2012, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 24%. Revenue was approximately $7.5 billion, representing 44%  total company revenue. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% for fiscal 2012. Revenue was approximately $5.1 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue. Core operating income is 2.1% for the full year. The High Velocity segment decreased 14%. Revenue was approximately $4.6 billion, representing 27% of total company revenue. The core operating income was 3.8% for the full year.
Total company revenue grew 4%, with core operating income for the year at 4.3%.
For the full fiscal year, there were 3 10% customers: Apple, Cisco and RIM. And for fiscal 2013, we currently expect to have 1 10% customer within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. I now ask you to turn to Slide 7, where I'd like to review some of our balance sheet metrics.
We ended the fiscal year with cash balances of approximately $1.2 billion. This cash balance reflects $443 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. $500 million of proceeds from our recent 4.7% seniors unsecured notes offering and the subsequent paydown of $240 million of revolver subsidiary debt. As a result of our successful bond offering, net interest expense will increase by approximately $20 million or equivalent to $0.09 of earnings per share in fiscal 2013 versus that in fiscal 2012. In the quarter, our inventory decreased by approximately 5% to $2.3 billion while inventory turns remained at 7. EBITDA in the quarter was $263 million or $1,073,000,000 for the full fiscal year, representing 6.3% of revenue, a 20 basis point expansion over the prior fiscal year. For the year, we purchased approximately 3.2 million shares, totaling $71 million, $29 million remains available under the stock repurchase authorization.
Our GAAP return on invested capital was 22% for the full fiscal year.
I'd now like to take a moment in Slide 8 to discuss our capital investments. For capital expenditures during the fiscal year -- excuse me, our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $202 million, $481 million for the fiscal year. Of the $481 million, 70% was related to investments in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our fiscal 2013 expectations in capital expenditures should be in the range of $400 million to $500 million depending on capacity and production. And consistent with fiscal 2012, 70% of the spend will be directed towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. We currently expect minimal investments in our Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity segments.
For the first fiscal quarter of 2013, our capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million depending on the timing of completion of our infrastructure and capacity expansions. Last quarter, I discussed expansion of our capacity within our Specialized Services sector. The additional square footage in Wuxi, China has been completed and should be fully occupied in the coming weeks. As you will recall, we signed an agreement to establish this site in Chengdu, China. The first phase of this construction is anticipated to be complete late in the calendar year.
Let's turn to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our cash flows. We're pleased with our operating cash flow performance in fiscal 2012. Cash flow from operations in the fiscal year was $634 million. Cash flows after capital expenditures were $152 million. As a result of anticipated EBITDA expansion and continued working capital management, we currently estimate that cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013 will be $1 billion, with cash flows after capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $600 million. From a liquidity standpoint, we're extremely well-positioned to support business with further investment, seek acquisitions that will enhance our capabilities in key areas and return capital to shareholders via our ongoing dividend and stock repurchase programs. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of shares during the next 12 months. This authorization is consistent with our fiscal 2012 actions to minimize the impact of equity issuance and diluted share count. I'd remind you, the $20 million remains available on the previous authorization.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 10, where we'll discuss our segment targets. Beginning in fiscal '13, we feel it's appropriate to reset some of our long-term targets to better reflect the current dynamics within our operating segments. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we believe a 15% growth is an appropriate expectation on an organic basis. Our Nucor operating income target is 5.5% to 7%. For the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we are slightly reducing our core operating income target to 3% to 4%, with our revenue growth expectation for the segment being in the range of 0% to 5%.
Conversely, we're increasing our core operating target for the High Velocity business to 2.5% to 3.5% range as a result of operational efficiencies and high levels of execution. Our revenue expectation for this segment is in the range of 0% to 5%. The table provide some further color regarding these new targets in this section of the call. On an overall company basis, we still believe a 5% core operating margin is attainable and realistic for the profile of our revenue continues to shift towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 12 and 13, where I'll discuss fiscal '13 and first quarter guidance. We entered fiscal 2013 with a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic climate. Consistent with our strategy, we remain well-positioned to continue to build momentum in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment throughout the fiscal year. As a result, we would estimate year-over-year GAAP and core earnings per share growth in the range of 5% to 10% for fiscal '13. The first quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenue on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 2% in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 million. GAAP operating income is estimated to be in the range of $140 million to $175 million or 3.3% to 3.9% of revenue. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.50 on a per diluted share basis, with a diluted share count of 212 million shares. Based on current expectations, the GAAP tax rate is expected to be 28%.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.62 per diluted share. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate from core operating income is expected to be 22% for the fiscal year.
Finally, turning to our segments and the year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 12%. Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis. And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 24% on a year-over-year basis. I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss FQ4 results and near-term outlook. I will then pull back to a more macro view to address our long-term growth and margin range changes and our thoughts behind those changes. We are disappointed with our income and margin performance for the fourth quarter. We are ramping a large-scale, complex program within our Materials Technology Group. Although we expect the challenges of the program during the start up phase, quality and efficiency levels lag behind our assumptions for the quarter. We intentionally widened our guidance range for FQ4 2012 in order to accommodate some expected inefficiencies during this ramp.
FQ4 '12, our mix shift was also unfavorable as revenue was lower than expected in Diversified Manufacturing Services and higher-than-expected in High Velocity. Finally, income levels and some certainty EMS programs notably in defense and Clean Tech lower than expected. We are very pleased with our cash flow per performance for the quarter and for the year. We produced $442 million of cash flow from operations and $240 million of free cash flow on our fourth fiscal quarter. For the year, we produced $643 million in cash flow from operations, more than adequate to cover our capital expenditures and return $136 million in capital to shareholders. We're also very pleased to reduce inventory levels by over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
As we reach more mature levels of production on new programs, and as the balance of the business is stable and improving, we would expect operating income levels above $200 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal 2013. We would expect this to result in a fourth consecutive record year for Jabil in FY '13.
Turning toward our longer-term outlook, we believe this is an appropriate time to review our long-term growth and margin targets for our 3 business groups. Looking back over the past 3 years, actual performance towards our strategic plan has been very good. From FY 2010 to FY 2012, the company has grown revenue and EPS on a compounded annual growth rate of 13% and 55%, respectively. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, from fiscal '10 through fiscal '12, we have posted an annual growth rate of revenue of 33% while earning margins in the targeted range. In fiscal 2010, the DMS business was $4.2 billion in revenue. By 2012, we expanded the business by $3.3 billion to a total revenue level of $7.5 billion. DMS now comprises 45% of our total business and is our largest sector by far. So with that success, why change targets? For one, we are working from a much larger revenue base and we've learned a few things about growing this business, particularly in highly complex areas such as health care, for example. Balanced growth requires significant investment and engineering, design, quality, resources and capabilities. Our growth platform is premised on genuine differentiation driven by unique capabilities. We will expand our capabilities in making investments necessary to grow the long-term view. Over the next 3 years, that could mean weak periods of the low-end of the new margin range followed by periods where we have a realistic opportunity to perform at the high-end of the margin range. Because we are working from a larger revenue base and because individual program wins tend to be small with long gestation periods and very long product cycles, we will target a 15% organic growth rate. You can expect us to make strategic acquisitions in this area, which could periodically drive growth above 15%. One note of exception in this formal is our Materials Technology Group. MTG remains poised for robust revenue growth above the 15% target for DMS. Growth will come from its core mobility business, as well as expansion in the health care and other strategic markets and initiatives.
Turning to Enterprise & Infrastructure, for the 3-year period from FY '10 to FY '12, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. While recently margins have come under pressure partly from poor performance in Europe and more recently slowing the growth. It appears to us that this business is undergoing fundamental changes. Businesses and governments are spending less on hardware and more on services and functionality. The reasons behind us go beyond the soft global economy and budget constraints. Computing, power, bandwidth, hardware technology of all advanced and great deal in recent years, further reducing the need for hardware spend. The movement to cloud computing and will continue. We believe Jabil will continue to play an important role with the world's best customers in this business area, spending picks up, I think we will outperform the market. But lower growth rates and standardization comes commoditization and lower margins. Our expectations are similar to the High Velocity sector. Again, I would expect Jabil's to continue to play an important role with strategic customers in this area. In 2010, this business operated with a margin profile of 1.2%, by focusing on lean manufacturing, new engagement models and focusing on fewer key customer relationships, financial performance improved significantly. We believe that improvement is sustainable over the next few years.
Our growth in margin expectations for High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure, are converging into a similar range. We think this will be the natural direction for traditional EMS markets over the next few years. In the E&I High Velocity sectors, we expect to drive strong cash flow and financial returns appropriate to risk. We will certainly focus intently on lean manufacturing, operational performance, service excellence in key customers. Over the next 3 years, we will see Jabil move deeper and more aggressively into our DMS markets. If we continue to lever on our strategic plan on this area, Jabil should continue to set the bar for our industry. We will focus less on top line and more on the quality of growth and bottom line performance. For the company overall, delivering on our promise of quality, long-term growth will further strengthen the business and make Jabil a better supplier, employer, customer and investment."

We're getting off maybe to a little bit softer start. So I think your revenue levels have a little bit wider than that based on current macroenvironment, that kind of thing. So kind of look at it that way. I think from a margin expectation standpoint, again, we're starting off with a bit of a slow start in the first fiscal quarter, in particular, we're still handicapping in some underperformance in Specialized Services, and continuing to mend our E&I performance in some of the other business areas. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I don't think we're far from quarters where the company's earning well above $200 million per quarter in operating income. So the back half of the year looks very good on -- similar to slightly up revenue levels. So again, we started 2012 -- I've in fact looked at the prepared slide presentation for 2012, the outset, that we call for moderate revenue growth in 2012, fiscal 2012. We got that a little bit more. We started the year expecting a little bit better revenue growth than what we put up. But we think in looking at fiscal year '13, given the growth opportunities we have in DMS and really kind of resetting the bar to a macroeconomic environment that we expect to continue to be somewhat lackluster.

About $5 million associated with the mix change, negative mix change, Diversified Manufacturing Services revenue was down and High Velocity was up from expectations. So we called for a 17% increase in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and we put up '12 -- we called for a 22% decline in High Velocity and it only declined 10%. So negative mix change there another $5 million. And then Forbes mentioned some poor profitability in particular areas, particularly Clean Tech, which has been soft with cutbacks in government spending.

They're very different businesses. Enterprise & Infrastructure is much more complex in terms of the services that we provide. Order fulfillment, very complex logistics, very complicated product in some cases a little bit higher mix than High Velocity. But that said, seems to be kind of moving in the same general direction in terms of a traditional EMS marketplace. And we'll apply the same kind of Playbook that we use to improve profitability and High Velocity, focused on key customers, cut back cut back on nonvalue add resources and investments that you have a onetime thought were strategic but customers don't actually use or want. Really focus on lean manufacturing, plant consolidation, the types of things that turned High Velocity from a sub 2% business to a plus 3% business. And I think we're on that bath. Enterprise infrastructure is a little bit more materials intensive. The products are more expensive. There's more material flow-through in the products. So the return on value add is still pretty good.

In fact, I think we're pursuing areas where higher levels of differentiation are possible for us and doable for us in health care and industrial, and some of the other areas. We've taken a look back over the last few years, and we've operated in the range of 6% to 8% but at the low-end of that range. So having -- continuing to have 8% is the upper level seems a little -- a little bit forced. And frankly, we would've gone out and aggressively grown this area. And I outlined in the prepared remarks, Wamsi, we've learned a few things in terms of the level of infrastructure that it takes, the engineering expertise that it takes. It's a lot of small programs in industrial and health care that you need to win. And we don't want to -- we don't want to impede the business development prospects that our people have to aggressively grow the business. So the 5.5% bottom end of the range isn't telegraphing competition, price are not getting paid. It's telegraphing that -- that's a very acceptable margin level in that business, and telegraphing that we're going to go, aggressively grow and get deeper and deeper into the DMS areas and really look for more balanced growth. Our growth has been primarily driven, particularly in the last 12 months by Specialized Services. We want to see better growth in health care and just instrumentation and industrial. And we need to balance that growth out across all 3 of those sectors. So we're going to -- we're going to aggressively pursue that. And frankly, I think that a 5.5% to 7% range, 8% may not have been achievable previously. I think we have a reasonable shot at driving the business to, in certain periods into the -- closer to 7%.
And Forbes outlined given the mix that we have here between E&I, High Velocity and the DMS margin structure, the company can still put up a 5% operating margin at the type of growth rates that we're talking about. So we still feel very good about that. And our operating margins at 5% would be significantly above our -- we'll be best in class, our 6.3% EBITDA margins we're already a couple of hundred basis points against similarly sized companies in our industry.

I mean, it's just -- it's really -- I think last quarter, the last 12 months have been a record by a significant degree in terms of shipments. But the industry is going from what was kind of a techie start up, lots of capital flowing into the business or lots of start up companies in the industry to a very concentrated business that was attacked aggressively by particularly Chinese suppliers. And that really drove pricing down in polysilicon -- polysilicons and chemical supply and the pricing has dropped. I think long term, to the extent that we can maintain the manufacturing capability and the process capability that we'll be able to have a profitable business there longer-term. But we're going through this transition where these -- the last 5 years ago, when all of the money really flowed into solar, these kind of techie start-u% companies are going out of business. They don't have the capacity and scale, the investment to hang in there. So we're going through a transitioning in customer base, and I think -- I don't think that we have -- by the way that we look at it today, I can't certainly couldn't promise you that we won't have any more, but we don't see any additional charges like that on the horizon. And hopefully we'll be able to keep that manufacturing capability together and do business with successful companies in the future because the overall volume in that business is still increasing."

It's better than contracting. And there are really no incremental changes. There's just been no incremental positives.

This compares to $165.",1753,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I'll ask you to refer to Slide 3. 
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $144.2 million or 3.3% of revenue. This compares to $165.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion, or 3.9%, for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.39.
Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a distressed consumer charge, decreased 6% to $175 million and represented 4% of revenue. This compares to $187 million, or 4.4%, for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 13% over the prior year. 
Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by approximately $5.9 million during the quarter as a result of charges taken connected to our solar business. These charges were isolated with one customer. Given the very difficult industry conditions, we're operating with an abundance of caution with any solar or solar-related opportunity with strict contractual operating agreements in place.
Now I ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2012, net revenue was $17.2 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income increased 7% to $622 million, representing 3.6% of revenue. This compares to $579 million of operating income on revenues of $16.5 billion and 3.5% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.87, an 8% increase over the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and settlement of receivables and related charges, increased 3% to $736 million and represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $715 million, or 4.3%, for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.40, an increase of 3% over fiscal 2011.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 14% on a year-over-year basis driven by continued strength in Specialized Services, growth in Instrumentation & Healthcare, offset by softening of demand in defense and aerospace and Industrial & Clean Tech. Revenue for this segment was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 45% of total company revenue. Core operating income declined in the quarter to 5.3% of revenue. Our core operating income results were negatively impacted by a challenging ramp within our Specialized Services sector and lower income levels in certain Diversified Manufacturing Services programs.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenues in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2.4%, an improvement of 20 basis points on a sequential basis. We expect to see continued positive progression during the course of fiscal 2013 with regards to operating performance.
The High Velocity segment decreased 10% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue was $1.1 billion, representing approximately 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Despite large declines in our handset business, core operating income for this segment remained 3.8% of revenue. 
I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our segment performance on a yearly basis.
In fiscal 2012, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 24%. Revenue was approximately $7.5 billion, representing 44%  of total company revenue. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% for fiscal 2012. Revenue was approximately $5.1 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue. Core operating income was 2.1% for the full year. Our High Velocity segment increased 14%. Revenue was approximately $4.6 billion, representing 27% of total company revenue. The core operating income was 3.8% for the full year. Total company revenue grew 4% with core operating income for the year at 4.3%.
For the full fiscal year, there were 3 10% customers: Apple, Cisco and RIM. And for fiscal 2013, we currently expect to have 1 10% customer within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. 
I now ask you to turn to Slide 7, where I'd like to review some of our balance sheet metrics. We ended the fiscal year with cash balances of approximately $1.2 billion. This cash balance reflects $443 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, $500 million of proceeds from our recent 4.7% senior unsecured notes offering and the subsequent paydown of $240 million of revolver and subsidiary debt. As a result of our successful bond offering, net interest expense will increase by approximately $20 million or equivalent to $0.09 of earnings per share in fiscal 2013 versus that in fiscal 2012. In the quarter, our inventory decreased by approximately 5% to $2.3 billion, while inventory turns remained at 7. EBITDA in the quarter was $263 million or $1,073,000,000 for the full fiscal year, representing 6.3% of revenue, a 20-basis-point expansion over the prior fiscal year. For the year, we purchased approximately 3.2 million shares totaling $71 million. $29 million remains available under this stock repurchase authorization. Our GAAP return on invested capital was 22% for the full fiscal year.
I'd now like to take a moment in Slide 8 to discuss our capital investments. Our capital expenditures during the fiscal year -- excuse me, our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $202 million, $481 million for the fiscal year. Of the $481 million, 70% was related to investments in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our fiscal 2013 expectations with capital expenditures shall be in the range of $400 million to $500 million depending on levels of capacity and production. And consistent with fiscal 2012, 70% of the spend will be directed towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. We currently expect minimal investments in our Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity segments.
For the first fiscal quarter of 2013, our capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million depending on the timing of completion of our infrastructure and capacity expansions. Last quarter, I discussed the expansion of our capacity within our Specialized Services sector. The additional square footage in Wuxi, China has been completed and should be fully occupied in the coming weeks. As you will recall, we signed an agreement to establish a site in Chengdu, China. The first phase of this construction is anticipated to be complete late in the calendar year.
Let's turn to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our cash flows. We're pleased with our operating cash flow performance in fiscal 2012. Cash flow from operations in the fiscal year were $634 million. Cash flows after capital expenditures were $152 million. As a result of anticipated EBITDA expansion and continued working capital management, we currently estimate that cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013 will be $1 billion with cash flows after capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $600 million. From a liquidity standpoint, we're extremely well positioned to support business with further investment, seek acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities in key areas and return capital to shareholders via our ongoing dividend and stock repurchase programs. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of shares during the next 12 months. This authorization is consistent with our fiscal 2012 actions to minimize the impact of equity issuance on diluted share count. I'd remind you the $20 million remains available on the previous authorization.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 10, where we'll discuss our segment targets. Beginning in fiscal '13, we feel it's appropriate to reset some of our long-term targets to better reflect the current dynamics within our operating segments. 
For  Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we believe a 15% growth is an appropriate expectation on an organic basis. Our new core operating income target is 5.5% to 7%. 
For the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we are slightly reducing our core operating income target to 3% to 4% with our revenue growth expectation for the segment being in the range of 0% to 5%.
Conversely, we're increasing our core operating target for the High Velocity business to 2.5% to 3.5% range as a result of operational efficiencies and high levels of execution. Our revenue expectation for this segment is in the range of 0% to 5%. And Tim table provide some further color regarding these new targets in his section of the call. 
On an overall company basis, we still believe a 5% core operating margin is attainable and realistic as the profile of our revenue continues to shift towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
I now ask you to refer to Slides 12 and 13, where I'll discuss fiscal '13 and first quarter guidance. We enter fiscal 2013 with a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic climate. Consistent with our strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to build momentum in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment throughout the fiscal year. As a result, we would estimate year-over-year GAAP and core earnings per share growth to be in the range of 5% to 10% for fiscal '13. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenue on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 2% in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. GAAP operating income is estimated to be in the range of $140 million to $175 million or 3.3% to 3.9% of revenue. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.50 on a per diluted share basis with a diluted share count of 212 million shares. Based on current expectations, the GAAP tax rate is expected to be 28%.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.62 per diluted share. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate from core operating income is expected to be 22% for the fiscal year.
Finally, turning to our segments and the year-on-year performance. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 12%. Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis. And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 24% on a year-over-year basis. I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss FQ4 results and near-term outlook. I will then pull back to a more macro view to address our long-term growth and margin range changes and our thoughts behind those changes. 
We are disappointed with our income and margin performance for the fourth quarter. We are ramping a large-scale, complex program within our Materials Technology Group. Although we expected challenges in the program during the start-up phase, quality and efficiency levels lagged behind our assumptions for the quarter. We intentionally widened our guidance range for FQ4 2012 in order to accommodate some expected inefficiencies during this ramp.
For FQ4 '12, our mix shift was also unfavorable as revenue was lower than expected in Diversified Manufacturing Services and higher than expected in High Velocity. Finally, income levels in certain DMS programs, notably in defense and Clean Tech, lower than expected. 
We are very pleased with our cash flow performance for the quarter and for the year. We produced $442 million of cash flow from operations and $240 million of free cash flow in our fourth fiscal quarter. For the year, we produced $643 million in cash flow from operations, more than adequate to cover our capital expenditures and return $136 million in capital to shareholders. We're also very pleased to reduce inventory levels by over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
As we reach more mature levels of production on new programs, and as the balance of the business is stable to improving, we would expect operating income levels above $200 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal 2013. We would expect this to result in a fourth consecutive record year for Jabil in FY '13.
Turning toward our longer-term outlook, we believe this is an appropriate time to review our long-term growth and margin targets for our 3 business groups. Looking back over the past 3 years, actual performance to our strategic plan has been very good. From FY 2010 through FY 2012, the company has grown revenue and EPS on a compounded annual growth rate of 13% and 55%, respectively. In Diversified Manufacturing Services from fiscal '10 through fiscal '12, we have posted a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 33% while earning margins in the targeted range. In fiscal 2010, the DMS business was $4.2 billion in revenue. By 2012, we expanded the business by $3.3 billion to a total revenue level of $7.5 billion. DMS now comprises 45% of our total business and is our largest sector by far. 
So with that success, why change targets? For one, we are working from a much larger revenue base. And we've learned a few things about growing this business, particularly in highly complex areas such as health care, for example. Balanced growth requires significant investment in engineering, design, quality, resources and capabilities. 
Our growth platform is premised on genuine differentiation driven by unique capabilities. We will expand our capabilities and making investments necessary to grow with a long-term view. Over the next few years, that could mean brief periods at the low end of the new margin range, followed by periods where we have a realistic opportunity to perform at the high end of the margin range. Because we are working from a larger revenue base, and because individual program wins tend to be small with long gestation periods and very long product cycles, we will target a 15% organic growth rate. You can expect us to make strategic acquisitions in this area, which could periodically drive growth above 15%. 
One note of exception to this formula is our Materials Technology Group. MTG remains poised for robust revenue growth above the 15% target for DMS. Growth will come from its core mobility business as well as expansion to health care and other strategic markets and initiatives.
Turning to Enterprise & Infrastructure. For the 3-year period from FY '10 through FY '12, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. More recently, margins have come under pressure partly from poor performance in Europe and, more recently, slowing momentum and growth. 
It appears to us that this business is undergoing fundamental change. Businesses and governments are spending less on hardware and more on services and functionality. The reasons behind this go beyond the soft global economy and budget constraints. Computing power, bandwidth, hardware technology have all advanced a great deal in recent years, further reducing the need for hardware spend. The movement to cloud computing is real and will continue. 
We believe Jabil will continue to play an important role with the world's best customers in this business area. If spending picks up, I think we will outperform the market. But with lower growth rates and standardization comes commoditization and lower margins. 
Our expectations are similar for the High Velocity sector. Again, I would expect Jabil to continue to play an important role with strategic customers in this area. In 2010, this business operated with a margin profile of 1.2%. By focusing on lean manufacturing, new engagement models and focusing on fewer key customer relationships, financial performance improved significantly. We believe that improvement is sustainable over the next few years.
Our growth in margin expectations for High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure are converging into a similar range. We think this will be the natural direction for traditional EMS markets over the next few years. In the E&I and High Velocity sectors, we expect to drive strong cash flow and financial returns appropriate to risk. We will certainly focus intently on lean manufacturing, operational performance, service excellence and key customers. 
Over the next 3 years, we will see Jabil move deeper and more aggressively into our DMS markets. If we continue to lever on our strategic plan in this area, Jabil should continue to set the bar for our industry. We will focus less on top line and more on the quality of growth and bottom line performance. For the company overall, delivering on our promise of quality and long-term growth will further strengthen the business and make Jabil a better supplier, employer, customer and investment."

We're getting off maybe to a little bit softer start. So I think your revenue levels would a little bit wide of that based on current macro environment and that kind of thing. So we kind of look at it that way. I think from a margin expectation standpoint, again we're starting off with a bit of a slow start in the first fiscal quarter in particular as we're still handicapping in some underperformance in Specialized Services and continuing to mend our E&I performance in some of the other business areas. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I don't think we're far from quarters where the company's earning well above $200 million per quarter in operating income. So the back half of the year looks very good on -- similar to slightly up revenue levels. So again, we started 2012 -- if in fact you looked at the prepared slide presentation for 2012 at the outset, we called for moderate revenue growth in 2012, fiscal 2012. We got that a little bit more. We started the year expecting a little bit better revenue growth than what we put up. But we think looking at fiscal year '13, given the growth opportunities we have in DMS and really kind of resetting the bar to a macroeconomic environment that we expect to continue to be somewhat lackluster, we think a 5% to 10% growth is very, very doable for us."

So we called for a 17% increase in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and we put up '12 -- we called for a 22% decline in High Velocity and it only declined 10%. So negative mix change there, another $5 million.

In some cases, a little bit higher mix than High Velocity. So -- but that said, it seems to be kind of moving in the same general direction in terms of a traditional EMS marketplace. And we'll apply the same kind of playbook that we used to improve profitability in High Velocity: focus on key customers, cutback on non-value add resources and investments that you at one time thought were strategic but customers don't actually use or want, really focus on lean manufacturing, plant consolidation, the types of things that turned High Velocity from a sub-2% business to a plus-3% business.

So I think continued expansion in EBITDA and energy performance in '13 gives us a really great shot at $1 billion in operating cash flow."

In fact, I think we're pursuing areas where higher levels of differentiation are possible for us and doable for us in health care and industrial and some of the other areas. We've taken a look back over the last few years, and we've operated in the range of 6% to 8% but at the low end of that range. So having -- continuing to have 8% as the upper level seems a little bit forced. And frankly, we go out and aggressively grown this area. And I outlined in the prepared remarks, Wamsi, we've learned a few things in terms of the level of infrastructure that it takes, the engineering expertise that it takes. It's a lot of small programs in industrial and health care that you need to win. And we don't want to impede the business development prospects that our people have to aggressively grow the business. So the 5.5% bottom end of the range isn't telegraphing competition, price or not getting paid. It's telegraphing that, that's a very acceptable margin level in that business and telegraphing that we're going to go aggressively grow and get deeper and deeper into the EMS areas and really look for more balanced growth. Our growth has been primarily driven, particularly in the last 12 months, by Specialized Services. We want to see better growth in health care and just instrumentation and industrial, and we need to balance that growth out across all 3 of those sectors. So we're going to aggressively pursue that. And frankly, I think that a 5.5% to 7% range, 8% may not have been achievable previously. I think we have a reasonable shot at driving the business to, in certain periods, into the -- closer to 7%. And I think Forbes outlined that given the mix that we have here between E&I, High Velocity and the DMS margin structure, the company can still put up a 5% operating margin at the type of growth rates that we're talking about. So we still feel very good about that. And our operating margins at 5% would be significantly above our best in-- will be best in class. Our 6.3% EBITDA margins were already a couple of hundred basis points against similarly sized companies in our industry. So we're going to continue to really focus on margin expansion, cash flow generation, EBITDA margins and really running a really healthy business."

And we're handicapping in potential changes in mix, not that we think that they're going to happen, but they could. If -- for instance, if mobility EMS revenue were again took off and made up the larger percentage of the overall High Velocity business, that could have the impact of reducing margins. If things stayed as they are today, then we would expect to continue to operate in that range.

I think long term, to the extent that we can maintain the manufacturing capability and the process capability, that we'll be able to have a profitable business there longer term. But we're going through this transition where these -- the last -- 5 years ago when all of the money really flowed into solar, these kind of techie, start-up companies, they're going out of business.

I'll ask you to refer to Slide 3. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $144.2 million or 3.3% of revenue. This compares to $165.",1754,"Thank you, Beth, and hello, everyone. I'll ask you to refer to Slide 3. 
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $144.2 million or 3.3% of revenue. This compares to $165.5 million of GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion, or 3.9% for the same period in the prior year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.39.
Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and a distressed consumer charge, decreased 6% to $175 million and represented 4% of revenue. This compares to $187 million, or 4.4% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 13% over the prior year. 
Please note that our GAAP operating results were negatively impacted by approximately $5.9 million during the quarter as a result of charges taken connected to our solar business. These charges were isolated with one customer. Given the very difficult industry conditions, we're operating with an abundance of caution with any solar or solar-related opportunity with strict contractual operating agreements in place.
Now I ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2012, net revenue was $17.2 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income increased 7% to $622 million, representing 3.6% of revenue. This compares to $579 million of operating income on revenues of $16.5 billion and 3.5% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.87, an 8% increase over the prior year. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and settlement of receivables and related charges increased 3% to $736 million and represents 4.3% of revenue. This compares to $715 million, or 4.3% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.40, an increase of 3% over fiscal 2011.
I now ask you to turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 14% on a year-over-year basis driven by continued strength in Specialized Services, growth in Instrumentation & Healthcare, offset by softening of demand in defense and aerospace and Industrial & Clean Tech. Revenue for this segment was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 45% of total company revenue. Core operating income declined in the quarter to 5.3% of revenue. Our core operating income results were negatively impacted by a challenging ramp within our Specialized Services sector and lower income levels in certain Diversified Manufacturing Services programs.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, representing 30% of total company revenues in the fourth quarter. Core operating income for the segment was 2.4%, an improvement of 20 basis points on a sequential basis. We expect to see continued positive progression during the course of fiscal 2013 with regards to operating performance.
The High Velocity segment decreased 10% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued weakness in handset volumes. Revenue was $1.1 billion, representing approximately 25% of total company revenue in the quarter. Despite large declines in our handset business, core operating income for this segment remained 3.8% of revenue. 
I now ask you to turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our segment performance on a yearly basis.
In fiscal 2012, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 24%. Revenue was approximately $7.5 billion, representing 44% of total company revenue. Core operating income was 6.1% of revenue for the full year. The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment decreased 2% for fiscal 2012. Revenue was approximately $5.1 billion, representing 29% of total company revenue. Core operating income was 2.1% for the full year. Our High Velocity segment increased 14%. Revenue was approximately $4.6 billion, representing 27% of total company revenue. The core operating income was 3.8% for the full year. Total company revenue grew 4%, with core operating income for the year at 4.3%.
For the full fiscal year, there were 3 10% customers: Apple, Cisco and RIM. And for fiscal 2013, we currently expect to have 1 10% customer within our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. 
I now ask you to turn to Slide 7, where I'd like to review some of our balance sheet metrics. We ended the fiscal year with cash balances of approximately $1.2 billion. This cash balance reflects $443 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, $500 million of proceeds from our recent 4.7% senior unsecured notes offering and the subsequent paydown of $240 million of revolver and subsidiary debt. As a result of our successful bond offering, net interest expense will increase by approximately $20 million or equivalent to $0.09 of earnings per share in fiscal 2013 versus that in fiscal 2012. In the quarter, our inventory decreased by approximately 5% to $2.3 billion, while inventory turns remained at 7. EBITDA in the quarter was $263 million or $1,073,000,000 for the full fiscal year, representing 6.3% of revenue, a 20-basis-point expansion over the prior fiscal year. For the year, we purchased approximately 3.2 million shares totaling $71 million. $29 million remains available under this stock repurchase authorization. Our GAAP return on invested capital was 22% for the full fiscal year.
I'd now like to take a moment in Slide 8 to discuss our capital investments. Our capital expenditures during the fiscal year -- excuse me, our capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $202 million, $481 million for the fiscal year. Of the $481 million, 70% was related to investments in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. Our fiscal 2013 expectations with capital expenditures shall be in the range of $400 million to $500 million, depending on levels of capacity and production. And consistent with fiscal 2012, 70% of the spend will be directed towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. We currently expect minimal investments in our Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity segments.
For the first fiscal quarter of 2013, our capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, depending on the timing of completion of our infrastructure and capacity expansions. Last quarter, I discussed the expansion of our capacity within our Specialized Services sector. The additional square footage in Wuxi, China has been completed and should be fully occupied in the coming weeks. As you will recall, we signed an agreement to establish a site in Chengdu, China. The first phase of this construction is anticipated to be complete late in the calendar year.
Let's turn to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our cash flows. We're pleased with our operating cash flow performance in fiscal 2012. Cash flow from operations in the fiscal year were $634 million. Cash flows after capital expenditures were $152 million. As a result of anticipated EBITDA expansion and continued working capital management, we currently estimate that cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013 will be $1 billion with cash flows after capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $600 million. From a liquidity standpoint, we're extremely well positioned to support business with further investment, seek acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities in key areas and return capital to shareholders via our ongoing dividend and stock repurchase programs. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of shares during the next 12 months. This authorization is consistent with our fiscal 2012 actions to minimize the impact of equity issuance on diluted share count. I'd remind you the $20 million remains available on the previous authorization.
I now ask you to refer to Slide 10, where we'll discuss our segment targets. Beginning in fiscal '13, we feel it's appropriate to reset some of our long-term targets to better reflect the current dynamics within our operating segments. 
For the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, we believe a 15% growth is an appropriate expectation on an organic basis. Our new core operating income target is 5.5% to 7%. 
For the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment, we are slightly reducing our core operating income target to 3% to 4%, with our revenue growth expectation for the segment being in the range of 0% to 5%.
Conversely, we're increasing our core operating target for the High Velocity business to 2.5% to 3.5% range as a result of operational efficiencies and high levels of execution. Our revenue expectation for this segment is in the range of 0% to 5%. And Tim table provide some further color regarding these new targets in his section of the call. 
On an overall company basis, we still believe a 5% core operating margin is attainable and realistic as the profile of our revenue continues to shift towards Diversified Manufacturing Services.
I now ask you to refer to Slides 12 and 13, where I'll discuss fiscal '13 and first quarter guidance. We enter fiscal 2013 with a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic climate. Consistent with our strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to build momentum in our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment throughout the fiscal year. As a result, we would estimate year-over-year GAAP and core earnings per share growth to be in the range of 5% to 10% for fiscal '13. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenue on a year-over-year basis to increase by approximately 2% in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. GAAP operating income is estimated to be in the range of $140 million to $175 million or 3.3% to 3.9% of revenue. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.50 on a per diluted share basis with a diluted share count of 212 million shares. Based on current expectations, the GAAP tax rate is expected to be 28%.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $200 million, and core operating margin in the range of 4% to 4.4%. Our core earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.62 per diluted share. Based on the current estimates of production, the tax rate from core operating income is expected to be 22% for the fiscal year.
Finally, turning to our segments and the year-on-year performance. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 12%. Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis. And finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 24% on a year-over-year basis. 
I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss FQ4 results and near-term outlook.

I'll take a few minutes to discuss FQ4 results and near-term outlook. I will then pull back to a more macro view to address our long-term growth and margin range changes and our thoughts behind those changes. 
We are disappointed with our income and margin performance for the fourth quarter. We are ramping a large-scale, complex program within our Materials Technology Group. Although we expected challenges in the program during the start-up phase, quality and efficiency levels lagged behind our assumptions for the quarter. We intentionally widened our guidance range for FQ4 2012 in order to accommodate some expected inefficiencies during this ramp.
For FQ4 '12, our mix shift was also unfavorable as revenue was lower than expected in Diversified Manufacturing Services and higher than expected in High Velocity. Finally, income levels in certain DMS programs, notably in defense and Clean Tech, were lower than expected. 
We are very pleased with our cash flow performance for the quarter and for the year. We produced $442 million of cash flow from operations and $240 million of free cash flow in our fourth fiscal quarter. For the year, we produced $643 million in cash flow from operations, more than adequate to cover our capital expenditures and return $136 million in capital to shareholders. We're also very pleased to reduce inventory levels by over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
As we reach more mature levels of production on new programs, and as the balance of the business is stable to improving, we would expect operating income levels above $200 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal 2013. We would expect this to result in a fourth consecutive record year for Jabil in FY '13.
Turning toward our longer-term outlook, we believe this is an appropriate time to review our long-term growth and margin targets for our 3 business groups. Looking back over the past 3 years, actual performance to our strategic plan has been very good. From FY 2010 through FY 2012, the company has grown revenue and EPS on a compounded annual growth rate of 13% and 55%, respectively. In Diversified Manufacturing Services from fiscal '10 through fiscal '12, we have posted a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 33% while earning margins in the targeted range. In fiscal 2010, the DMS business was $4.2 billion in revenue. By 2012, we expanded the business by $3.3 billion to a total revenue level of $7.5 billion. DMS now comprises 45% of our total business and is our largest sector by far. 
So with that success, why change targets? For one, we are working from a much larger revenue base. And we've learned a few things about growing this business, particularly in highly complex areas such as health care, for example. Balanced growth requires significant investment in engineering, design, quality, resources and capabilities. 
Our growth platform is premised on genuine differentiation driven by unique capabilities. We will expand our capabilities and making investments necessary to grow with a long-term view. Over the next few years, that could mean brief periods at the low end of the new margin range, followed by periods where we have a realistic opportunity to perform at the high end of the margin range. Because we are working from a larger revenue base, and because individual program wins tend to be small with long gestation periods and very long product cycles, we will target a 15% organic growth rate. You can expect us to make strategic acquisitions in this area, which could periodically drive growth above 15%. 
One note of exception to this formula is our Materials Technology Group. MTG remains poised for robust revenue growth above the 15% target for DMS. Growth will come from its core mobility business as well as expansion to health care and other strategic markets and initiatives.
Turning to Enterprise & Infrastructure. For the 3-year period from FY '10 through FY '12, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. More recently, margins have come under pressure partly from poor performance in Europe and more recently slowing momentum and growth. 
It appears to us that this business is undergoing fundamental change. Businesses and governments are spending less on hardware and more on services and functionality. The reasons behind this go beyond the soft global economy and budget constraints. Computing power, bandwidth, hardware technology have all advanced a great deal in recent years, further reducing the need for hardware spend. The movement to cloud computing is real and will continue. 
We believe Jabil will continue to play an important role with the world's best customers in this business area. If spending picks up, I think we will outperform the market. But with lower growth rates and standardization comes commoditization and lower margins. 
Our expectations are similar for the High Velocity sector. Again, I would expect Jabil to continue to play an important role with strategic customers in this area. In 2010, this business operated with a margin profile of 1.2%. By focusing on lean manufacturing, new engagement models and focusing on fewer key customer relationships, financial performance improved significantly. We believe that improvement is sustainable over the next few years.
Our growth in margin expectations for High Velocity and Enterprise & Infrastructure are converging into a similar range. We think this will be the natural direction for traditional EMS markets over the next few years. In the E&I and High Velocity sectors, we expect to drive strong cash flow and financial returns appropriate to risk. We will certainly focus intently on lean manufacturing, operational performance, service excellence and key customers. 
Over the next 3 years, we will see Jabil move deeper and more aggressively into our DMS markets. If we continue to lever on our strategic plan in this area, Jabil should continue to set the bar for our industry. We will focus less on top line and more on the quality of growth and bottom line performance. For the company overall, delivering on our promise of quality and long-term growth will further strengthen the business and make Jabil a better supplier, employer, customer and investment."

So I think your revenue levels would a little bit wide of that based on current macro environment and that kind of thing. So we kind of look at it that way. I think from a margin expectation standpoint, again we're starting off with a bit of a slow start in the first fiscal quarter in particular, as we're still handicapping in some underperformance in Specialized Services and continuing to mend our E&I performance in some of the other business areas. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I don't think we're far from quarters where the company's earning well above $200 million per quarter in operating income. So the back half of the year looks very good on -- similar to slightly up revenue levels. So again, we started 2012 -- if in fact you looked at the prepared slide presentation for 2012 at the outset, we called for moderate revenue growth in 2012, fiscal 2012. We got that a little bit more. We started the year expecting a little bit better revenue growth than what we put up. But we think looking at fiscal year '13, given the growth opportunities we have in DMS and really kind of resetting the bar to a macroeconomic environment that we expect to continue to be somewhat lackluster, we think a 5% to 10% growth is very, very doable for us."

So we called for a 17% increase in Diversified Manufacturing Services, and we put up '12 -- we called for a 22% decline in High Velocity and it only declined 10%. So negative mix change there, another $5 million. And then Forbes mentioned some poor profitability in particular areas, particularly Clean Tech, which has been soft with cutbacks in government spending. And that's -- solar as well as some other areas in defense and aerospace has been underperforming. So that's another $5 million.

They are very different businesses. Enterprise & Infrastructure is much more complex in terms of the services we provide. Order fulfillment, very complex. Logistics, very complicated products. In some cases, a little bit higher mix than High Velocity. So -- but that said, it seems to be kind of moving in the same general direction in terms of a traditional EMS marketplace. And we'll apply the same kind of playbook that we used to improve profitability in High Velocity: focus on key customers, cutback on non-value add resources and investments that you at one time thought were strategic but customers don't actually use or want, really focus on lean manufacturing, plant consolidation, the types of things that turned High Velocity from a sub-2% business to a plus-3% business. And I think we're on that path. Enterprise & Infrastructure is also a little bit more material intensive. The products are more expensive. There's more material flow through the products. So the return on value add is still pretty good. But Craig, I think that's the right way to look at it is that we apply the playbook to High Velocity that we can also apply to Enterprise & Infrastructure, even though that's a little bit more complicated business area by its nature."

But realistically, it's going to take us over the course of the first fiscal quarter to really determine whether or not we'll master the process to a level that will drive targeted margins. And we've baked in some of that uncertainty into our forecast. So we've been through this before now a couple of times, and my -- I believe that we'll make it happen.

Here we -- so if you look at fiscal '12, our energy performance was pretty poor overall. It was very pleasing to see the $100 million come out in the fourth quarter.

In fact, I think we're pursuing areas where higher levels of differentiation are possible for us and doable for us in health care and industrial and some of the other areas. We've taken a look back over the last few years, and we've operated in the range of 6% to 8% but at the low end of that range. So having -- continuing to have 8% as the upper level seems a little bit forced. And frankly, we go out and aggressively grow this area. And I outlined in the prepared remarks, Wamsi, we've learned a few things in terms of the level of infrastructure that it takes, the engineering expertise that it takes. It's a lot of small programs in industrial and health care that you need to win. And we don't want to impede the business development prospects that our people have to aggressively grow the business. So the 5.5% bottom end of the range isn't telegraphing competition, price or not getting paid. It's telegraphing that that's a very acceptable margin level in that business and telegraphing that we're going to go aggressively grow and get deeper and deeper into the EMS areas and really look for more balanced growth. Our growth has been primarily driven, particularly in the last 12 months, by Specialized Services. We want to see better growth in health care and just instrumentation and industrial, and we need to balance that growth out across all 3 of those sectors. So we're going to aggressively pursue that. And frankly, I think that a 5.5% to 7% range, 8% may not have been achievable previously. I think we have a reasonable shot at driving the business to, in certain periods, into the -- closer to 7%. And I think Forbes outlined that given the mix that we have here between E&I, High Velocity and the DMS margin structure, the company can still put up a 5% operating margin at the type of growth rates that we're talking about. So we still feel very good about that. And our operating margins at 5% would be significantly above our best in-- will be best in class. Our 6.3% EBITDA margins were already a couple of hundred basis points against similarly sized companies in our industry. So we're going to continue to really focus on margin expansion, cash flow generation, EBITDA margins and really running a really healthy business."

We think that means we'll see where the mix shift goes. And we think over the course of Q1 and certainly Q2, we'll hit targeted levels of efficiencies and quality in our Specialized Services group. So we would look for a rebound in margin performance, particularly in Q2 through Q4, depending on revenue levels and levels of production, but we would look for a rebound in margins over that period."

And I -- in my experience, generally, quarter-to-quarter, there's a few negatives and a few positives, and they kind of offset and things go on. Just recently, there haven't been many upsides. So I don't think anything has incrementally changed, though. And again, I'm not pessimistic at all. I think the overall environment is relatively stable. And I -- when I look at our business geographically, Asia and North America have done reasonably well in this environment. Europe has been very poor, very poor.

In these slides, you will find the financial information that we cover during this conference call. We ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with Slide 2, our forward-looking statements.
During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including those regarding anticipated outlook for our business, our currently expected second quarter of fiscal 2013 net revenue and earnings results, our long-term outlook for our company and improvements in our operational efficiencies and financial performance. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, on subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today's call will begin with our first fiscal quarter results, highlights and comments from Forbes Alexander as well as guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2013. Tim Main will follow with macroeconomic and Jabil-specific comments about our performance, our model and our current outlook. We will then open it up to questions from our call attendees.

I ask you to please refer to Slide 3.Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $170.",779,"Thank you, Beth. Hello, everyone. I ask you to please refer to Slide 3.
Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $170.8 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion or 3.9% for the same period in the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation decreased 1% to $192.5 million. It represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $194.6 million or 4.5% for the same period in the prior year.
Core diluted earnings per share were $0.61.
If you now please turn to Slide 4, I'll discuss our segments. In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strength in Specialized Services and offset by weakness in instrumentation, Clean Tech products related to the Smart Grid rollout encompassing meters, solar and wind-related products. Revenue for this segment was approximately $2.2 billion, representing 47% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 5.8% of revenue.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 17% on a year-over-year basis as we expected. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 30% total company revenue in the first quarter. Core operating income for the segment is consistent with the previous quarter of 2.4% of revenue.
The High Velocity segment decreased 20% on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by declines in handset volumes. Revenue was $1 billion, representing approximately 23% of total company revenue. Revenue performed better than our guidance as we saw strength in the quarter on handset volumes, offset by weakness in printing and set-top box revenues. As a result, core operating income for this segment was 3.2% of revenue.
I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5.
We ended the quarter with cash balances of approximately $1.03 billion. During the quarter, cash flows from operations were, as expected, approximately $152 million. Capital expenditures were $165 million with majority of these investments being focused towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. In addition, during the course of the quarter, we purchased approximately 7.3 million shares, totaling $129 million, and average price of $17.58, exhausting our approved stock repurchase program. Our sales cycle increased by approximately 2 days, primarily as a result of growth in inventory levels, positioned to support revenue levels in the first month of our second fiscal quarter.
Our core EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $284 million, representing 6.1% of revenue. And our GAAP return on invested capital for the quarter was 21%. We're pleased with the operating performance in our first fiscal quarter. Core operating performance is well within our expected range while revenues above. We're off to a great start in terms of cash generation with continued expectations of generating $1 billion from operational cash flows in the current fiscal year. I'm also very pleased to note that earlier in December, Standard & Poor's upgraded our corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to BBB- from BB+. Our capital expenditure estimates for the fiscal year remain in the previously guided range. And we now expect expenditures to be -- excuse me, to be towards the higher end of that range of $500 million. And we continue to make investments to support ongoing growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services footprint and capabilities.
If you now please turn to Slide 7 and 8, and I'll discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4% to be within the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, and core operating margin in the range of 3.8% to 4.1%. Our GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 per diluted share, and core earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58 per diluted share. This has been based upon a diluted share count of 208 million shares. Based on the current estimates of production, tax rate from core operating income is expected to remain at 22% for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the quarter are estimated to be $200 million.
Turning to our segments, the year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing services segment is expected to increase 7%, the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 15%, and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 13% on a year-over-year basis. I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

The primary takeaway for me is the robust revenue growth, which I think is remarkable in the current environment. I would also like to highlight growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, which rose to 47% of our overall business. On each of these dimensions, the quarter was record-setting for the company. Growth in Enterprise & Infrastructure was a bit better than planned, which was welcomed in an otherwise lackluster demand environment. Year-over-year, margins were up 40 basis points. I'd like to see more progress but we believe we are on path to be within our targeted range by year-end. We are making investments in complex order fulfillment capabilities diluting near-term progress. The new leadership of this business area is taking a page from the High Velocity Playbook, focusing on customer service and lean manufacturing principles to improve services further. In the High Velocity Systems, business conditions weakened a bit. A notable exception of this being mobility products, which enjoined a stronger-than-expected quarter. The sector overall, we are pleased with the prospects for the year.
Our DMS sector is outpacing an excess of $8 billion per year. We've enjoyed multiple years of strong growth and now have significant scale to build upon. Quarter-on-quarter, margins improved 50 basis points and are within our targeted long-term range. Additional growth and improvements in our Healthcare & Instrumentation, and our Industrial & Clean Tech businesses have served to drive margins higher in the range.
Specialized Services and in particular, our Materials Technology Group, continued to deliver growth in remarkable levels. Specialized Services is now 31% of our overall business, representing a unique value stream for Jabil. AMS is investing in expanding capabilities to advance logistics and IT-intensive services on emerging markets while also expanding to serve new verticals. The MTG group has become a leader in both innovation and scale, and we will continue to invest in MTG's growth. Specialized Services is a higher value add on electronics and capabilities, providing us with solid diversification and new paths for future growth.
Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated that continues. Please turn to Slide 10.
Now I'll take a moment to discuss this slide. Here, we compared Jabil's DMS sector size and growth rate with that of our North American competition. We've taken publicly available information and reconciled the data to provide as close to an apples-to-apples comparison as possible, adjusted to calendar year basis. The X axis of this chart reflects the dollars of revenue added to the respective DMS sectors in the last 3 calendar years, the years being 2010 through 2012. The Y axis reflects compound annual growth rate over that time same time frame while the bubbles are representative of the estimated calendar 2012 revenue for each provider. Jabil is represented by the green bubble. You can see that Jabil has added approximately $3 billion of revenue in the Diversified Manufacturing segment during the period, with a compound annual growth rate approximating 30%. Jabil's DMS revenues are expected to be about $7.8 billion in calendar 2012, representing an excess of 40% of the total DMS revenue expected by North American providers for the year.
And Jabil is in a unique position the benefit of diversification and scale that comes with successfully competing at E&I, High Velocity and DMS factors. With efficient operations in E&I and High Velocity, combined with a large and growing presence in Diversified Manufacturing Services, we are in an advantaged position to drive margin and cash flow generation.
Please turn to Slide 11. Here, we compare absolute EBITDA dollars in margins among the largest North American EMS providers with the most recent trailing 12-month period. The bubble size and X axis exhibit absolute EBITDA dollars while the Y axis exhibit EBITDA margins. Two companies dominate the market today and are responsible for over 70% of the dollars generated in the industry. However, Jabil's intense focus and operational efficiency and growth in DMS, places it in a unique position of combining scale and cash flow. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Jabil's recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We plan to continue investing in our capabilities, Customer Services and people. We are in a competitive business and understand we must continuously improve our value proposition for customers. With This in mind and in spite of the uncertain environment, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future."

So the overall growth in inventory is prepositioning of inventory for this upcoming quarter.

It's really very consistent if you look back over our history, it's actually a very low level of seasonality in terms of being 5% down for the last 3, 4 years have been low single to 5% kind of seasonality. So a lot less than it's historically been. And the level of income that's coming out of the model for Q2 is very consistent with deleveraging, probably a little bit less than what we've seen historically. No, historically, we've seen something in the order of $0.15 to $0.20 on the dollar. And in this case, it's less than that. So I don't think it should be surprising from a deleveraging standpoint. Directionally, in terms of margins for the business, I said on the last conference call and I just reiterate that here a little bit, we see that Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity margins -- lessening in the 3% range, notwithstanding the fact that they have different long-term targets, at least in the next 3 to 5 quarters. I think we'd expect the average of the 2 to be in the 3% range, maybe a little bit better as we exit that period. But we're kind of an average of 3%. And I think that in terms of the Diversified Manufacturing Services, if you look forward a few quarters, we should be able to average 6% or a little bit better. So that would model to something in the mid-4s for the company overall, which we think is a reasonable way to look at it beyond Q2. So looking at Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 of 2014."

And how should we think about how we can get from not year-over-year EPS growth right now, but yet such a big increase in the second half of the year.

And really over the last 4, 5 months of the year, we can do even further. So I think in terms of business confidence we need to see that turnaround a little bit, so that those capital spending areas can improve. That said, we feel like we have line of sight to adequate enterprise infrastructure growth for the year even in the poor spending environment. So we actually feel good about that. In the High Velocity area, there has been some weaknesses as Forbes outlined in set-top boxes and printers. There's really not much to make us believe that there'll be any type of robust recovery in those business areas any time soon. Our mobility business on the other hand is -- looks like that could trend upwards over the course of the year. So I guess we're cautiously optimistic about that element. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, as I said, the industrial and health care areas are relatively stable. And we do have a pipeline of opportunity that could supply -- not spectacular growth but growth. And if we see the Clean Tech and instrumentation -- a lot improve a little bit, that would really contribute to a better margins next year in the DMS area. In Aftermarket Services, they are in the midst of ramping some very large, very complex customers. If those are -- if those customers are successfully, ramped over the course of the next quarter or 2, I think that could contribute to a much better earnings and margin performance in the second half of the year. And then in the Materials Technology Group, we think that will be another good year of growth."

I'll ask you to please refer to Slide 3.Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $1",781,"Thank you, Beth. Hello, everyone. I'll ask you to please refer to Slide 3.
Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $170.8 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion or 3.9% for the same period in the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation decreased 1% to $192.5 million. It represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $194.6 million or 4.5% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.61.
If you now please turn to Slide 4 where I'll discuss our segments. In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strength in Specialized Services though offset by weakness in instrumentation, Clean Tech products related to the Smart Grid rollout encompassing meters, solar and wind-related products. Revenue for this segment was approximately $2.2 billion, representing 47% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 5.8% of revenue.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 17% on a year-over-year basis as we'd expected. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 30% total company revenue in the first quarter. Core operating income for the segment is consistent with the previous quarter of 2.4% of revenue.
High Velocity segment decreased 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by declines in handset volumes. Revenue was $1 billion, representing approximately 23% of total company revenue. Revenue performed better than our guidance as we saw strength in the quarter on handset volumes, offset by weakness in printing and set-top box revenues. As a result, core operating income for this segment was 3.2% of revenue.
I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with cash balances of approximately $1.03 billion. During the quarter, cash flows from operations were, as expected, approximately $152 million. Capital expenditures were $165 million with majority of these investments being focused towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. In addition, during the course of the quarter, we purchased approximately 7.3 million shares, totaling $129 million, an average price of $17.58, exhausting our approved stock repurchase program. Our sales cycle increased by approximately 2 days, primarily as a result of growth in inventory levels, positioned to support revenue levels in the first month of our second fiscal quarter.
Our core EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $284 million, representing 6.1% of revenue, and our GAAP return on invested capital for the quarter was 21%. We're pleased with the operating performance in our first fiscal quarter. Core operating performance is well within our expected range while revenue is above. We're off to a great start in terms of our cash generation with continued expectations of generating $1 billion from operational cash flows in the current fiscal year.
I'm also very pleased to note that earlier in December, Standard & Poor's upgraded our corporate credit and senior unsecured issue ratings to BBB- from BB+. Our capital expenditure estimates for the fiscal year remain in the previously guided range. And we now expect expenditures to be -- excuse me, to be towards the higher end of that range for $500 million. And we continue to make investments to support ongoing growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services footprint and capabilities.
If you now please turn to Slide 7 and 8 where I'll discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4% to be within the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, and core operating margin in the range of 3.8% to 4.1%.
Our GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 per diluted share, and core earnings per share estimated to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58 per diluted share. This has been based upon a diluted share count of 208 million shares. Based on the current estimates of production, tax rate from core operating income is expected to remain at 22% for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the quarter are estimated to be $200 million.
Turning to our segments. The year-on-year performance, the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 7%, the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 15% and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 13% on a year-over-year basis.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

The primary takeaway for me is the robust revenue growth, which I think is remarkable in the current environment. I would also highlight growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, which rose to 47% of our overall business. On each of these dimensions, the quarter was record-setting for the company. Growth in Enterprise & Infrastructure was a bit better than planned, which was welcomed in an otherwise lackluster demand environment.
Year-over-year, margins were up 40 basis points. I'd like to see more progress, but we believe we are on path to be within our targeted range by year end. We are making investments in complex order fulfillment capabilities diluting near-term progress. The new leadership of this business area is taking a page from the High Velocity Playbook, focusing on customer service and lean manufacturing principles to improve results further. In the High Velocity sector, business conditions weakened a bit. A notable exception of this being mobility products, which enjoyed a stronger-than-expected quarter. The sector overall, we are pleased with the results and prospects for the year.
Our DMS sector is now pacing in excess of $8 billion per year. We've enjoyed multiple years of strong growth and now have significant scale to build upon. Quarter-on-quarter, margins improved 50 basis points and are within our targeted long-term range. Additional growth and improvements in our Healthcare & Instrumentation, and our Industrial & Clean Tech businesses have served to drive margins higher in the range.
Specialized Services and, in particular, our Materials Technology Group, continued to leverage growth to remarkable levels. Specialized Services is now 31% of our overall business, representing a unique value stream for Jabil. AMS is investing in expanding capabilities to advance logistics and IT-intensive services in emerging markets while also expanding to serve new verticals. The MTG group has become a leader in both innovation and scale, and we will continue to invest in MTG's growth. Specialized Services is a higher value add on electronics set of capabilities, providing us with solid diversification and new paths for future growth. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated manner continues. Please turn to Slide 10.
Now I'll take a moment to discuss this slide. Here, we compare Jabil's DMS sector size and growth rate with that of our North American competition. We have taken publicly available information and then reconciled the data to provide as close to an apples-to-apples comparison as possible, adjusted to a calendar year basis. The X axis of this chart reflects the dollars of revenue added to the respective DMS sectors in the last 3 calendar years, the years being 2010 through 2012. The Y axis reflects compound annual growth rate over that same time frame, while the bubbles are representative of the estimated calendar 2012 revenue for each provider. Jabil is represented by the green bubble.
You can see that Jabil's added approximately $3 billion of revenue in the Diversified Manufacturing segment during the period, with compound annual growth rate approximating 30%. Jabil's DMS revenues are expected to be about $7.8 billion in calendar 2012, representing an excess of 40% of the total DMS revenue expected by North American providers for the year.
Jabil is in a unique position, enjoying the benefit of diversification and scale that comes with successfully competing in E&I, High Velocity and DMS sectors. With efficient operations in E&I and High Velocity, combined with a large and growing presence in Diversified Manufacturing Services, we are in an advantaged position to drive margin and cash flow generation.
Please turn to Slide 11. Here, we compare absolute EBITDA dollars in margins among the largest North American EMS providers with the most recent trailing 12-month period. The bubble size and X axis exhibit absolute EBITDA dollars while the Y axis exhibit EBITDA margins. Two companies dominate the market today and are responsible for over 70% of the dollars generated in the industry. However, Jabil's intense focus and operational efficiency and growth in DMS, places it in a unique position of combining scale and cash flow. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Jabil's recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We plan to continue investing in our capabilities, Customer Services and people. We are in a competitive business and understand we must continuously improve our value proposition for customers. With this in mind and in spite of the uncertain environment, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future."

So nothing extraordinary there. Finished goods did rise I think on average about $30 million to $40 million. So the overall growth in inventory is prepositioning of inventory for this upcoming quarter. There's still a lot of mobility product to be built and shipped in the early part of this quarter that sell-through into carriers and such like. So that's the main reason, and then we should see that start to normalize in our second fiscal quarter."

It's really very consistent if you look back over our history, it's actually a very low level of seasonality in terms of being 5% down for the last 3, 4 years have been low single to 5% kind of seasonality. So a lot less than it's historically been. And the level of income that's coming out of the model for Q2 is very consistent with deleveraging, probably a little bit less than what we've seen historically. Now historically, we see something on the order of $0.15 to $0.20 on the dollar. And in this case, it's less than that. So I don't think it should be surprising from a deleveraging standpoint. Directionally, in terms of margins for the business, I said on the last conference call and I'd just reiterate that here a little bit, we see that Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity margins -- call lessening in the 3% range, notwithstanding the fact that they have different long-term targets at least in the next 3 to 5 quarters. I think we'd expect the average of the 2 to be in the 3% range, maybe a little bit better as we exit that period. But we're kind of an average of 3%. And I think that in terms of the Diversified Manufacturing Services, if you look forward a few quarters, we should be able to average 6% or a little bit better. So that would model to something in the mid-4s for the company overall, which we think is a reasonable way to look at it beyond Q2. So looking at Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 of 2014."

And really, over the last 4, 5 months of the year, we can't even further. So I think in terms of business confidence, we need to see that turnaround a little bit so that those capital spending areas can improve. That said, we feel like we have line of sight to adequate enterprise infrastructure growth for the year even in the poor spending environment. So we actually feel good about that. In the High Velocity area, there has been some weakness, as Forbes outlined, in set-top boxes and printers. There's really not much to make us believe that there'll be any type of robust recovery in those business areas any time soon. Our mobility business on the other hand is -- looks like that could trend upwards over the course of the year. So I guess, we're cautiously optimistic about that element. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, as I said, the industrial and the health care areas are relatively stable. And we do have a pipeline of opportunity that can supply not spectacular growth but growth. And if we see the Clean Tech and Instrumentation level out and improve a little bit, that would really contribute to a better margin next year in the DMS area. In Aftermarket Services, they are in the midst of ramping some very large, very complex customers. If those are -- if those customers are successfully ramped over the course of the next quarter or 2, I think that can contribute to much better earnings and margin performance in the second half of the year. And then in the Materials Technology Group, we think that will be another good year of growth."

I'll ask you to please refer to Slide 3.Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $1",783,"Thank you, Beth. Hello, everyone. I'll ask you to please refer to Slide 3.
Net revenue for the first quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP operating income was $170.3 million or 3.7% of revenue. This compares to $170.8 million GAAP operating income on revenues of $4.3 billion or 3.9% for the same period in the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.51. Core operating income, excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, decreased 1% to $192.5 million. It represents 4.2% of revenue. This compares to $194.6 million or 4.5% for the same period in the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.61.
If you now please turn to Slide 4 where I'll discuss our segments. In the first quarter, our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment grew 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strength in Specialized Services, though offset by weakness in instrumentation, Clean Tech products related to the Smart Grid rollout encompassing meters, solar and wind-related products. Revenue for this segment was approximately $2.2 billion, representing 47% of total company revenue. Core operating income expanded in the quarter to 5.8% of revenue.
The Enterprise & Infrastructure segment increased 17% on a year-over-year basis as we'd expected. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, representing 30% total company revenue in the first quarter. Core operating income for the segment is consistent with the previous quarter at 2.4% of revenue.
The High Velocity segment decreased 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by declines in handset volumes. Revenue was $1 billion, representing approximately 23% of total company revenue. Revenue performed better than our guidance, as we saw strength in the quarter on handset volumes, offset by weakness in printing and set top box revenues. As a result, core operating income for this segment was 3.2% of revenue.
I'll now ask you to refer to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with cash balances of approximately $1.03 billion. During the quarter, cash flows from operations were, as expected, approximately $152 million. Capital expenditures were $165 million with the majority of these investments being focused towards our Diversified Manufacturing Services segment. In addition, during the course of the quarter, we purchased approximately 7.3 million shares, totaling $129 million, an average price of $17.58, exhausting our approved stock repurchase program. Our sales cycle increased by approximately 2 days, primarily as a result of growth in inventory levels, positioned to support revenue levels in the first month of our second fiscal quarter.
Our core EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $284 million, representing 6.1% of revenue, and our GAAP return on invested capital for the quarter was 21%. We're pleased with the operating performance in our first fiscal quarter. Core operating performance was well within our expected range while revenue is above. We're off to a great start in terms of our cash generation with continued expectations of generating $1 billion from operational cash flows in the current fiscal year.
I'm also very pleased to note that earlier in December, Standard & Poor's upgraded our corporate credit and senior unsecured issue ratings to BBB- from BB+. Our capital expenditure estimates for the fiscal year remain in the previously guided range. I would now expect expenditures to be -- excuse me, to be towards the higher end of that range for $500 million. And we continue to make investments to support ongoing growth in our Diversified Manufacturing Services footprint and capabilities.
If you now please turn to Slide 7 and 8 where I'll discuss our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis to increase approximately 4%, to be within the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, and core operating margin in the range of 3.8% to 4.1%.
Our GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 per diluted share, and core earnings per share estimated to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58 per diluted share. This being based upon a diluted share count of 208 million shares. Based on the current estimates of production, tax rate from core operating income is expected to remain at 22% for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the quarter are estimated to be $200 million.
Turning to our segments and year-on-year performance. The Diversified Manufacturing Services segment is expected to increase 7%, the Enterprise & Infrastructure segment is expected to increase 15% and finally, our High Velocity segment is expected to decline 13% on a year-over-year basis.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Tim Main."

The primary takeaway for me is the robust revenue growth, which I think is remarkable in the current environment. I would also highlight growth in Diversified Manufacturing Services, which rose to 47% of our overall business. On each of these dimensions, the quarter was record-setting for the company. Growth in Enterprise & Infrastructure was a bit better than planned. This was welcomed in an otherwise lackluster demand environment.
Year-over-year, margins were up 40 basis points. We'd like to see more progress, but we believe we are on path to be within our targeted range by year end. We are making investments in complex order fulfillment capabilities diluting near-term progress. The new leadership of this business area is taking a page from the High Velocity playbook, focusing on customer service and lean manufacturing principles to improve results further. In the High Velocity sector, business conditions weakened a bit. A notable exception of this being mobility products, which enjoyed a stronger-than-expected quarter. For the sector overall, we are pleased with the results and prospects for the year.
Our DMS sector is now pacing in excess of $8 billion per year. We've enjoyed multiple years of strong growth and now have significant scale to build upon. Quarter-on-quarter, margins improved 50 basis points and are within our targeted long-term range. Additional growth and improvements in our Healthcare & Instrumentation, and our Industrial & Clean Tech businesses which served to drive margins higher in the range.
Specialized Services and, in particular, our Materials Technology Group, continued to leverage growth to remarkable levels. Specialized Services is now 31% of our overall business, representing a unique value stream for Jabil. AMS is investing in expanding capabilities to advance logistics and IT-intensive services in emerging markets while also expanding to serve new verticals. The MTG group has become a leader in both innovation and scale, and we will continue to invest in MTG's growth. Specialized Services is a higher-value add, nonelectronics set of capabilities, providing us with solid diversification and new paths for future growth. Our focused strategy of driving growth and returns in a differentiated manner continues. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Now I'll take a moment to discuss this slide. Here, we compare Jabil's DMS sector size and growth rate with that of our North American competition. We have taken publicly available information and reconciled the data to provide as close to an apples-to-apples comparison as possible, adjusted to a calendar year basis. The x-axis of this chart reflects the dollars of revenue added to the respective DMS sectors in the last 3 calendar years, the years being 2010 through 2012. The y-axis reflects compound annual growth rate over that same time frame, while the bubbles are representative of the estimated calendar 2012 revenue for each provider. Jabil is represented by the green bubble.
You can see that Jabil has added approximately $3 billion of revenue in the Diversified Manufacturing segment during the period, a compound annual growth rate approximating 30%. Jabil's DMS revenues are expected to be about $7.8 billion in calendar 2012, representing an excess of 40% of the total DMS revenue expected by North American providers for the year.
Jabil is in a unique position, enjoying the benefit of diversification and scale that comes with successfully competing in E&I, High Velocity and DMS sectors. With efficient operations in E&I and High Velocity, combined with a large and growing presence in Diversified Manufacturing Services, we are in an advantaged position to drive margin and cash flow generation.
Please turn to Slide 11. Here, we compare absolute EBITDA dollars in margins among the largest North American EMS providers for the most recent trailing 12-month period. The bubble size and x-axis exhibit absolute EBITDA dollars, while the y-axis exhibit EBITDA margins. Two companies dominate the market today and are responsible for over 70% of the dollars generated in the industry. However, Jabil's intense focus in operational efficiency and growth in DMS, places it in a unique position of combining scale and cash flow. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Jabil's recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We plan to continue investing in our capabilities, customer services and people. We are in a competitive business and understand we must continuously improve our value proposition for customers. With this in mind, and in spite of the uncertain environment, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future."

It's really very consistent if you look back over our history, it's actually a very low level of seasonality in terms of being 5% down. The last 3, 4 years have been low single to 5% kind of seasonality, which is a lot less than it's historically been. And the level of income that's coming out of the model for Q2 is very consistent with deleveraging, probably a little bit less than what we've seen historically. Historically, we’d see something on the order of $0.15 to $0.20 on the dollar, and in this case, it's less than that. So I don't think it should be surprising from a deleveraging standpoint. Directionally, in terms of margins for the business, I said on the last conference call and I'd just reiterate that here a little bit, we see that Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity margins coalescing in the 3% range, notwithstanding the fact that they have different long-term targets, at least in the next 3 to 5 quarters. I think we'd expect the average of the 2 to be in the 3% range, maybe a little bit better as we exit that period. But kind of an average of 3%. And I think that in terms of the Diversified Manufacturing Services, if you look forward a few quarters, we should be able to average 6% or a little bit better. So that would model to something in the mid-4s for the company overall, which we think is a reasonable way to look at it beyond Q2. So looking at Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 of 2014."

Forbes mentioned CapEx trending towards the high end of the $500 million range, which means it will be adding capacity throughout the year. So we're at very high levels of utilization. We will be building additional capacity, not all of which is in Specialized Services but fundamentally, the vast majority of it into Diversified Manufacturing Services. So in terms of the drag, I think a lot of the interruptions that we highlighted in our Q4 call started to decline over the course of Q1, and we feel much better about the position that we're in today. I think margins would've been better in DMS if we had not seen a fairly significant decline in Clean Tech and Instrumentation business, which is very understandable, given the dynamics and particularly when you start thinking about renewable energy and Smart Grid metering, which tend to be government- and subsidy-related. So I think as that stabilizes and we start to improve margins in the healthcare and industrial areas that the overall DMS margin picture can improve."

And really, over the last 4, 5 months of the year, it weakened even further. So I think in terms of business confidence, we need to see that turn around a little bit so that those capital spending areas can improve. That said, we feel like we have line of sight to adequate enterprise infrastructure growth for the year, even in the poor spending environment. So we actually feel good about that. In the High Velocity area, there has been some weakness, as Forbes outlined, in set top boxes and printers. There's really not much to make us believe that there'll be any type of robust recovery in those business areas any time soon. Our mobility business on the other hand is -- looks like that could trend upwards over the course of the year. So I guess, we're cautiously optimistic about that element. In Diversified Manufacturing Services, as I said, the Industrial and the Healthcare areas are relatively stable. And we do have a pipeline of opportunity that can supply, not spectacular growth, but growth. And if we see the Clean Tech and Instrumentation level out and improve a little bit, that would really contribute to a better margin fixture in the DMS area. In aftermarket services, they are in the midst of ramping some very large, very complex customers. If those are -- if those customers are successfully ramped over the course of the next quarter or 2, I think that can contribute to much better earnings and margin performance in the second half of the year. And then in the Materials Technology Group, we think that will be another good year of growth."
