Welcome to the Integrys Energy Group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Delivering formal remarks with me today are Charlie Schrock our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe O'Leary, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Other executives, including Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Utilities; Mark Radtke, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Integrys Energy Group; and Dan Verbanac, President of Integrys Energy Services, are available for the question-and-answer session that will follow our formal remarks.
The slides supporting today's presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investors, select Presentations, and then today's presentation. Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through May 1, 2012.
I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor Rules including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and, in many cases, we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events, or otherwise. This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements, and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed last night, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday's news release, and Slide 48 in this appendix.
Slide 4 indicate that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the other. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.

I'll begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 financial results and operating highlights. Joe O'Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financing outlook for 2012. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to Slide 5, I am pleased to report improved earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we posted a 23% increase in diluted earnings per share adjusted over the same period in 2010. And for the full year, we posted about an 8% increase over the full year 2010. These favorable results are from the solid execution of our business plan.
As for 2012, we are introducing guidance for diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.55 with a midpoint of $3.45. Joe will have more to say on that in just a few moments.
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. Our utilities finished the year strong. As shown on Slide 19 in the appendix, the actual returns on equity for our natural gas and electric utilities were about 8% and 11% respectively in 2011. We expect some slight improvement in 2012, as our returns on equity for our utilities are projected to be in the range of 9% to 10%.
In terms of net income the shortfall of our actual utility earnings to authorized level was about $15.4 million in 2011, which is much better than $37 million that we had estimated at this time last year. The progress we made in 2011 places us within a range of what we can reasonably expect on a continuing basis.
From a rate perspective we reached resolutions on four of the five rate cases that were pending in 2011. This included rate cases for Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas and Upper Peninsula Power as well as the Wisconsin Public Service limited reopener case. The loan case that did not come to a final decision in 2011 was Minnesota Energy Resources, but interim rates were granted in February of 2011. The key details for each rate case are summarized in appendix Slides 22 to 26.
The highlight for our natural gas utility segment was our accelerated main replacement program in Chicago. In 2011, we began the field work for this program and installed 154 miles of new pipe, which is more than a threefold increase over what we have typically done in the past. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project.
Most of you are probably aware of the Court of Appeals ruling which found at the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve Rider ICR for our accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas. The Illinois Supreme Court recently denied our petition to hear an appeal of the ruling, which ended our options to the change the appellate court decision. We expect the appellate court to remand this back to ICC for further actions.
In the near term, we plan to continue with the Accelerated Main Replacement Project in Chicago and we'll seek recovery of our projected cost for the next year through the traditional ratemaking process. Beyond 2013, we will seek appropriate legislative or regulatory solutions to achieve timely recovery of the cost associated with the Accelerated Main Replacement Program.
For our regulated electric utility segment, environmental projects are of priority. We are proceeding with an environmental retrofit at the Columbia plant that was approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2011. And we plan to file a certificate of authority with the PSCW later this year for installation of environmental control equipment on our Weston 3 plant. We expect approval in 2013.
Turning to Slide 7, 2011 was the first year of Integrys Energy Services operating in its fully restructured environment. We saw improved unit margins in both, retail, natural gas and retail electric as we continue to provide value-added services to Integrys Energy Services customers. This is clearly evident from the information shown on slide 30 in the appendix.
Our customer retention continues to strong, nearly 90% of our commercial and industrial customers will retain in 2011. In addition, we grew by expanding our presence in existing geographical markets. For example, we participate in retail customer aggregation in Illinois that resulted in over 44,000 new electric customers. Last year, we also began offering electric products directly to small commercial and residential customers in Illinois and have added over 33,000 new customers through those offerings.
As announced in our news release in early February, we are now preparing to offer natural gas products and services to commercial and industrial customers in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
At December 31, 2011, our contracted retail natural gas and retail electric volumes for 2012 were both up by more than 4% in our retail markets as compared to the contracted volumes on December 31 of 2010.
So all told, Integrys Energy Services first full year of operation in its restructured environment was impressive as it more than doubled its contribution to adjusted earnings in 2011 compared to 2010, thus providing a nice complementary earning stream to our utility operations which as I mentioned earlier also had a very good year.
I'll now turn in the call over to Joe O'Leary.

I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter 2011 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share beginning with Slide 8. During the fourth quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle",1158,"Thanks Charlie. I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter 2011 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share beginning with Slide 8. During the fourth quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared with $0.91 for the same quarter in 2010. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we have made to arrive at diluted earning per share adjusted for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the fourth quarter 2011 was $1.01 versus $0.82 in the same period in 2010. More information on the comparative fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, adjusted earnings, and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on Slides 31 and 32 in the appendix. You will also find the full year 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on Slides 38 and 39 in the appendix.
On Slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The improved quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were primarily driven by favorable results in our regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services. These more than offset the lower sales volumes at the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather for those customer groups that are not covered under decoupling mechanisms. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 33 through 37.
Slide 10 presents the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the full year 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The only segment that was down in 2011 was the regulated electric utility, which was primarily driven by decreased margins related to rate order differences affected decoupling at Wisconsin public service. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 41 through 44. 
 
Moving to Slide 11, we have provided our capital expenditure plans for 20112 through 2014, the key segment drivers remain the same with environment retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
Slide 12 sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. You may recall from our former remarks during our quarterly earnings conference calls last year but due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate base growth in the near term. Our projected rate base chart for 2012 through 2014 appears at Slide 45 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. At January 24, 2012 Standard & Poor's upgraded the corporate credit rating for Integrys Energy Group to A- from BBB+. Similar action was taken for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Standard & Poor's also reaffirmed the corporate credit rating for Wisconsin Public Service with a stable outlook. In this report Standard & Poor's attributed their reaction to our improved business risk profile due to restructuring and reducing the size of our non-utility business and continuing to effectively managed regulatory risk.
Long term borrowings expected in 2012 include about $250 million to $300 million for Wisconsin Public Service, about $75 million for Peoples Gas and about $30 million for North Shore Gas. We do not plan to issue any new common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 14, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 and $3.55. And we have provided the details by segment. At this time, we are not projecting any special items such as non-cash mark-to-market gain or losses or any other items such as we have projected in the past. As such that the diluted earning per share adjusted numbers are the same as the GAAP numbers at this time. When we report future quarterly results we'll detail any special items that occur and provide you with diluted earnings per share adjusted.
Moving to Slide 15, we have provided you with the waterfall graph that starts with our 2011 adjusted earnings and shows the changes by reporting segment to get you to the midpoint of our 2012 guidance.
In 2012, we expect the earnings contribution for the Regulated Natural Gas Utility, Electric Transmission Investment, Holding Company and Other and Integrys Energy Services segments to improve over 2011. We expect the earnings contribution from our regulated electric utility segment to decline during 2012. Part of this has to do with items that occurred in 2011 that we don't expect to repeat in 2012 and part of it has to do with expense items that we plan to address with Wisconsin Public Services next rate filing for new rates to be effective in 2013.
For example, there was a $3 million after-tax benefit of lowered fuel cost that because they remained within the 2% band established by regulators, we were able to retain. We are not projection that to repeat in 2012 at this point.
In addition, the emission costs were lowered by $3 million after-tax. For 2012, the emission costs are part of the fuel window calculation and we aren't projecting emission cost be lowered in 2012.
In 2012, we are projecting certain expense items to increase relative to what they were in 2011 and we expect these items to be addressed in our next rate case filing in April, 2012 for new rates to be effective in 2013.
On an after-tax basis some examples include $6 million for increased transmission costs, $5 million for increased employee benefit costs and $5 million for reduced margins due to actual customer accounts differences and the loss of a wholesale customer.
We are projecting Integrys Energy Services earnings contribution 2012 to be up marginally from its strong performance in 2011. Integrys Energy Services contribution from energy marketing is expected to increase by about $7 million in 2012 which would be more than a 20% increase over 2011. This is somewhat offset by an expected decrease in adjusted earnings resulting from the expiration of certain capacity contracts associated we legacy generation assets.
The legacy generation assets contributed about $3 million in adjusted earnings in 2011 but we're projecting a loss of about $2 million in 2012 which represents a decline of about $5 million.
Consequently, as we resolved these issues with the regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services legacy generation assets, we believe we can remain on track to achieve our 4% to 6% long term growth objective in diluted earnings per share and adjusted on an average annualized basis from 2011 through 2015 as previously stated.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Charlie.

Before taking your questions I'll summarize the highlights of our call this morning as shown on Slide 16. First, we continued the execution of our business plans through our operational excellence initiatives, cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. On an adjusted basis our quarter end year-to-date performance improved over the same period last year.
Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company contributed to earnings as expected. And our nonregulated operations saw a meaningful growth in earnings and forward contracted retail volumes.
Our portfolio of businesses, regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in the Midwest, retail nonregulated energy services operations in the northeast quadrants of United States and our equity investments in the American Transmission Company, enabled us to meet our financial objective on a consolidated basis.
Our guidance for 2012, diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is between $3.35 and $3.55. And finally, as Joe mentioned, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We'll now open the call for your questions.

I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor Rules including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and, in many cases, we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events, or otherwise. This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements, and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed last night, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday's news release, and Slide 48 in this appendix.
Slide 4 indicate that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the other. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.

I'll begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 financial results and operating highlights. Joe O'Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financing outlook for 2012. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to Slide 5, I am pleased to report improved earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we posted a 23% increase in diluted earnings per share adjusted over the same period in 2010. And for the full year, we posted about an 8% increase over the full year 2010. These favorable results are from the solid execution of our business plan.
As for 2012, we are introducing guidance for diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.55 with a midpoint of $3.45. Joe will have more to say on that in just a few moments.
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. Our utilities finished the year strong. As shown on Slide 19 in the appendix, the actual returns on equity for our natural gas and electric utilities were about 8% and 11% respectively in 2011. We expect some slight improvement in 2012, as our returns on equity for our utilities are projected to be in the range of 9% to 10%.
In terms of net income the shortfall of our actual utility earnings to authorized level was about $15.4 million in 2011, which is much better than $37 million that we had estimated at this time last year. The progress we made in 2011 places us within a range of what we can reasonably expect on a continuing basis.
From a rate perspective we reached resolutions on 4 of the 5 rate cases that were pending in 2011. This included rate cases for Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas and Upper Peninsula Power as well as the Wisconsin Public Service limited reopener case. The loan case that did not come to a final decision in 2011 was Minnesota Energy Resources, but interim rates were granted in February of 2011. The key details for each rate case are summarized in appendix Slides 22 through 26.
The highlight for our natural gas utility segment was our accelerated main replacement program in Chicago. In 2011, we began the field work for this program and installed 154 miles of new pipe, which is more than a threefold increase over what we have typically done in the past. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project.
Most of you are probably aware of the Court of Appeals ruling which found at the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve Rider ICR for our accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas. The Illinois Supreme Court recently denied our petition to hear an appeal of the ruling, which ended our options to the change the appellate court decision. We expect the appellate court to remand this back to ICC for further actions.
In the near term, we plan to continue with the Accelerated Main Replacement Project in Chicago and we'll seek recovery of our projected cost for the next year through the traditional ratemaking process. Beyond 2013, we will seek appropriate legislative or regulatory solutions to achieve timely recovery of the cost associated with the Accelerated Main Replacement Program.
For our regulated electric utility segment, environmental projects are of priority. We are proceeding with an environmental retrofit at the Columbia plant that was approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2011. And we plan to file a certificate of authority with the PSCW later this year for installation of environmental control equipment on our Weston 3 plant. We expect approval in 2013.
Turning to Slide 7, 2011 was the first year of Integrys Energy Services operating in its fully restructured environment. We saw improved unit margins in both, retail, natural gas and retail electric as we continue to provide value-added services to Integrys Energy Services customers. This is clearly evident from the information shown on slide 30 in the appendix.
Our customer retention continues to strong, nearly 90% of our commercial and industrial customers were retained in 2011. In addition, we grew by expanding our presence in existing geographical markets. For example, we participated in retail customer aggregation in Illinois that resulted in over 44,000 new electric customers. Last year, we also began offering electric products directly to small commercial and residential customers in Illinois and have added over 33,000 new customers through those offerings.
As announced in our news release in early February, we are now preparing to offer natural gas products and services to commercial and industrial customers in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
At December 31, 2011, our contracted retail natural gas and retail electric volumes for 2012 were both up by more than 4% in our retained markets as compared to the contracted volumes on December 31 of 2010.
So all told, Integrys Energy Services first full year of operation in its restructured environment was impressive as it more than doubled its contribution to adjusted earnings in 2011 compared to 2010, thus providing a nice complementary earning stream to our utility operations which as I mentioned earlier also had a very good year.
I'll now turn in the call over to Joe O'Leary."

Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the fourth quarter 2011 was $1.01 versus $0.82 in the same period in 2010. More information on the comparative fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, adjusted earnings, and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on Slides 31 and 32 in the appendix. You will also find the full year 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on Slides 38 and 39 in the appendix.
On Slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The improved quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were primarily driven by favorable results at our regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services. These more than offset the lower sales volumes at the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather for those customer groups that are not covered under decoupling mechanisms. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 33 through 37.
Slide 10 presents the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the full year 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The only segment that was down in 2011 was the regulated electric utility, which was primarily driven by decreased margins related to rate order differences affected decoupling at Wisconsin public service. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 41 through 44. 
Moving to Slide 11, we have provided our capital expenditure plans for 20112 through 2014, the key segment drivers remain the same with environment retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
Slide 12 sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. You may recall from our former remarks during our quarterly earnings conference calls last year that due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate base growth in the near term. Our projected rate base chart for 2012 through 2014 appears at Slide 45 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. On January 24, 2012 Standard & Poor's upgraded the corporate credit rating for Integrys Energy Group to A- from BBB+. Similar action was taken for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Standard & Poor's also reaffirmed the corporate credit rating for Wisconsin Public Service with a stable outlook. In this report Standard & Poor's attributed their reaction to our improved business risk profile due to restructuring and reducing the size of our non-utility business and continuing to effectively managed regulatory risk.
Long term borrowings expected in 2012 include about $250 million to $300 million for Wisconsin Public Service, about $75 million for Peoples Gas and about $30 million for North Shore Gas. We do not plan to issue any new common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 14, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 and $3.55. And we have provided the details by segment. At this time, we are not projecting any special items such as non-cash mark-to-market gain or losses or any other items such as we have projected in the past. As such that the diluted earnings per share adjusted numbers are the same as the GAAP numbers at this time. When we report future quarterly results we'll detail any special items that occur and provide you with diluted earnings per share adjusted.
Moving to Slide 15, we have provided you with the waterfall graph that starts with our 2011 adjusted earnings and shows the changes by reporting segment to get you to the midpoint of our 2012 guidance.
In 2012, we expect the earnings contribution for the Regulated Natural Gas Utility, Electric Transmission Investment, Holding Company and Other and Integrys Energy Services segments to improve over 2011. We expect the earnings contribution from our regulated electric utility segment to decline during 2012. Part of this has to do with items that occurred in 2011 that we don't expect to repeat in 2012 and part of it has to do with expense items that we plan to address with Wisconsin Public Services next rate filing for new rates to be effective in 2013.
For example, there was a $3 million after-tax benefit of lower fuel cost that because they remained within the 2% band established by regulators, we were able to retain. We are not projection that to repeat in 2012 at this point.
In addition, the emission costs were lower by $3 million after-tax. For 2012, the emission costs are part of the fuel window calculation and we aren't projecting emission cost be lower in 2012.
In 2012, we are projecting certain expense items to increase relative to what they were in 2011 and we expect these items to be addressed in our next rate case filing in April, 2012 for new rates to be effective in 2013.
On an after-tax basis some examples include $6 million for increased transmission costs, $5 million for increased employee benefit costs and $5 million for reduced margins due to actual customer accounts differences and the loss of a wholesale customer.
We are projecting Integrys Energy Services earnings contribution 2012 to be up marginally from its strong performance in 2011. Integrys Energy Services contribution from energy marketing is expected to increase by about $7 million in 2012 which would be more than a 20% increase over 2011. This is somewhat offset by an expected decrease in adjusted earnings resulting from the expiration of certain capacity contracts associated we legacy generation assets.
The legacy generation assets contributed about $3 million in adjusted earnings in 2011 but we're projecting a loss of about $2 million in 2012 which represents a decline of about $5 million.
Consequently, as we resolved these issues with the regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services legacy generation assets, we believe we can remain on track to achieve our 4% to 6% long term growth objective in diluted earnings per share adjusted on an average annualized basis from 2011 through 2015 as previously stated.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Charlie."

Before taking your questions I'll summarize the highlights of our call this morning as shown on Slide 16. First, we continued the execution of our business plans through our operational excellence initiatives, cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. On an adjusted basis our quarter-end year-to-date performance improved over the same period last year.
Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company contributed to earnings as expected. And our non-regulated operations saw a meaningful growth in earnings and forward contracted retail volumes.
Our portfolio of businesses, regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in the Midwest, retail non-regulated energy services operations in the northeast quadrants of United States and our equity investments in the American Transmission Company, enabled us to meet our financial objective on a consolidated basis.
Our guidance for 2012, diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is between $3.35 and $3.55. And finally, as Joe mentioned, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.

The slides supporting today's presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investors, select Presentations, and then today's presentation. Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through May 1, 2012.
I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor Rules including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and, in many cases, we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events, or otherwise. This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements, and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed last night, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday's news release, and Slide 48 in this appendix.
Slide 4 indicate that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the other. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock."

I'll begin by providing a high level overview of our 2011 financial results and operating highlights. Joe O'Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financing outlook for 2012. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to Slide 5, I am pleased to report improved earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we posted a 23% increase in diluted earnings per share adjusted over the same period in 2010. And for the full year, we posted about an 8% increase over the full year 2010. These favorable results are from the solid execution of our business plan.
As for 2012, we are introducing guidance for diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.55 with a midpoint of $3.45. Joe will have more to say on that in just a few moments.
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. Our utilities finished the year strong. As shown on Slide 19 in the appendix, the actual returns on equity for our natural gas and electric utilities were about 8% and 11% respectively in 2011. We expect some slight improvement in 2012, as our returns on equity for our utilities are projected to be in the range of 9% to 10%.
In terms of net income the shortfall of our actual utility earnings to authorized level was about $15.4 million in 2011, which is much better than $37 million that we had estimated at this time last year. The progress we made in 2011 places us within a range of what we can reasonably expect on a continuing basis.
From a rate perspective we reached resolutions on 4 of the 5 rate cases that were pending in 2011. This included rate cases for Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas and Upper Peninsula Power as well as the Wisconsin Public Service limited reopener case. The loan case that did not come to a final decision in 2011 was Minnesota Energy Resources, but interim rates were granted in February of 2011. The key details for each rate case are summarized in appendix Slides 22 through 26.
The highlight for our natural gas utility segment was our accelerated main replacement program in Chicago. In 2011, we began the field work for this program and installed 154 miles of new pipe, which is more than a threefold increase over what we have typically done in the past. I congratulate the project team, our employees and our contractors for a successful first year of this project.
Most of you are probably aware of the Court of Appeals ruling which found at the Illinois Commerce Commission did not have the authority to approve Rider ICR for our accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas. The Illinois Supreme Court recently denied our petition to hear an appeal of the ruling, which ended our options to the change the appellate court decision. We expect the appellate court to remand this back to ICC for further actions.
In the near term, we plan to continue with the Accelerated Main Replacement Project in Chicago and we'll seek recovery of our projected cost for the next year through the traditional ratemaking process. Beyond 2013, we will seek appropriate legislative or regulatory solutions to achieve timely recovery of the cost associated with the Accelerated Main Replacement Program.
For our regulated electric utility segment, environmental projects are of priority. We are proceeding with an environmental retrofit at the Columbia plant that was approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2011. And we plan to file a certificate of authority with the PSCW later this year for installation of environmental control equipment on our Weston 3 plant. We expect approval in 2013.
Turning to Slide 7, 2011 was the first year of Integrys Energy Services operating in its fully restructured environment. We saw improved unit margins in both, retail, natural gas and retail electric as we continue to provide value-added services to Integrys Energy Services customers. This is clearly evident from the information shown on slide 30 in the appendix.
Our customer retention continues to strong, nearly 90% of our commercial and industrial customers were retained in 2011. In addition, we grew by expanding our presence in existing geographical markets. For example, we participated in retail customer aggregation in Illinois that resulted in over 44,000 new electric customers. Last year, we also began offering electric products directly to small commercial and residential customers in Illinois and have added over 33,000 new customers through those offerings.
As announced in our news release in early February, we are now preparing to offer natural gas products and services to commercial and industrial customers in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.
At December 31, 2011, our contracted retail natural gas and retail electric volumes for 2012 were both up by more than 4% in our retained markets as compared to the contracted volumes on December 31 of 2010.
So all told, Integrys Energy Services first full year of operation in its restructured environment was impressive as it more than doubled its contribution to adjusted earnings in 2011 compared to 2010, thus providing a nice complementary earning stream to our utility operations which as I mentioned earlier also had a very good year.
I'll now turn in the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter 2011 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share beginning with Slide 8. During the fourth quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle",1157,"Thanks Charlie. I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter 2011 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share beginning with Slide 8. During the fourth quarter of 2011, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared with $0.91 for the same quarter in 2010. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we have made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the fourth quarter 2011 was $1.01 versus $0.82 in the same period in 2010. More information on the comparative fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, adjusted earnings, and diluted earnings per share adjusted is reported by segment on Slides 31 and 32 in the appendix. You will also find the full year 2011 and 2010 comparative data for adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share adjusted on Slides 38 and 39 in the appendix.
On Slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The improved quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were primarily driven by favorable results at our regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services. These more than offset the lower sales volumes at the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather for those customer groups that are not covered under decoupling mechanisms. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 33 through 37.
Slide 10 presents the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the full year 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The only segment that was down in 2011 was the regulated electric utility, which was primarily driven by decreased margins related to rate order differences affected decoupling at Wisconsin public service. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 41 through 44. 
Moving to Slide 11, we have provided our capital expenditure plans for 20112 through 2014, the key segment drivers remain the same with environment retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
Slide 12 sets forth our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. You may recall from our former remarks during our quarterly earnings conference calls last year that due to the accumulated differed income taxes resulting from bonus tax depreciation capital expenditures less depreciation is not a good proxy for rate base growth in the near term. Our projected rate base chart for 2012 through 2014 appears at Slide 45 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. On January 24, 2012 Standard & Poor's upgraded the corporate credit rating for Integrys Energy Group to A- from BBB+. Similar action was taken for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Standard & Poor's also reaffirmed the corporate credit rating for Wisconsin Public Service with a stable outlook. In this report Standard & Poor's attributed their reaction to our improved business risk profile due to restructuring and reducing the size of our non-utility business and continuing to effectively managed regulatory risk.
Long term borrowings expected in 2012 include about $250 million to $300 million for Wisconsin Public Service, about $75 million for Peoples Gas and about $30 million for North Shore Gas. We do not plan to issue any new common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 14, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 and $3.55. And we have provided the details by segment. At this time, we are not projecting any special items such as non-cash mark-to-market gain or losses or any other items such as we have projected in the past. As such that the diluted earnings per share adjusted numbers are the same as the GAAP numbers at this time. When we report future quarterly results we'll detail any special items that occur and provide you with diluted earnings per share adjusted.
Moving to Slide 15, we have provided you with the waterfall graph that starts with our 2011 adjusted earnings and shows the changes by reporting segment to get you to the midpoint of our 2012 guidance.
In 2012, we expect the earnings contribution for the Regulated Natural Gas Utility, Electric Transmission Investment, Holding Company and Other and Integrys Energy Services segments to improve over 2011. We expect the earnings contribution from our regulated electric utility segment to decline during 2012. Part of this has to do with items that occurred in 2011 that we don't expect to repeat in 2012 and part of it has to do with expense items that we plan to address with Wisconsin Public Services next rate filing for new rates to be effective in 2013.
For example, there was a $3 million after-tax benefit of lower fuel cost that because they remained within the 2% band established by regulators, we were able to retain. We are not projection that to repeat in 2012 at this point.
In addition, the emission costs were lower by $3 million after-tax. For 2012, the emission costs are part of the fuel window calculation and we aren't projecting emission cost be lower in 2012.
In 2012, we are projecting certain expense items to increase relative to what they were in 2011 and we expect these items to be addressed in our next rate case filing in April, 2012 for new rates to be effective in 2013.
On an after-tax basis some examples include $6 million for increased transmission costs, $5 million for increased employee benefit costs and $5 million for reduced margins due to actual customer accounts differences and the loss of a wholesale customer.
We are projecting Integrys Energy Services earnings contribution 2012 to be up marginally from its strong performance in 2011. Integrys Energy Services contribution from energy marketing is expected to increase by about $7 million in 2012 which would be more than a 20% increase over 2011. This is somewhat offset by an expected decrease in adjusted earnings resulting from the expiration of certain capacity contracts associated we legacy generation assets.
The legacy generation assets contributed about $3 million in adjusted earnings in 2011 but we're projecting a loss of about $2 million in 2012 which represents a decline of about $5 million.
Consequently, as we resolved these issues with the regulated electric utility segment and Integrys Energy Services legacy generation assets, we believe we can remain on track to achieve our 4% to 6% long term growth objective in diluted earnings per share adjusted on an average annualized basis from 2011 through 2015 as previously stated.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Charlie."

Before taking your questions I'll summarize the highlights of our call this morning as shown on Slide 16. First, we continued the execution of our business plans through our operational excellence initiatives, cost control efforts and the timely filing of rate cases. On an adjusted basis our quarter-end year-to-date performance improved over the same period last year.
Our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company contributed to earnings as expected. And our non-regulated operations saw a meaningful growth in earnings and forward contracted retail volumes.
Our portfolio of businesses, regulated natural gas and electric utilities operating in the Midwest, retail non-regulated energy services operations in the northeast quadrants of United States and our equity investments in the American Transmission Company, enabled us to meet our financial objective on a consolidated basis.
Our guidance for 2012, diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis is between $3.35 and $3.55. And finally, as Joe mentioned, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.

Welcome to the Integrys Energy Group’s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Delivering formal remarks with me today are Charlie Schrock, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe O’Leary, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other executives including Mark Radtke, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Integrys Energy Group; and Dan Verbanac, President of Integrys Energy Services are available for the question-and-answer session at the conclusion of our formal remarks.
Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Utilities, is unable to make to today’s call due to an American Gas Association event. As many of you know Larry is the 2012 Chairman of AGA. The slide supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investors, select presentations and then today’s presentation. Before we begin, I will advice everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through August 7, 2012.
I need to direct you to slide three of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed last evening the forward-looking statements section of yesterday’s news release and slide 41 in the appendix.
Slide four today indicates that presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

I’ll begin by providing a high-level overview of our first quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for 2012, and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to slide five. In the first quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $1.55, down $0.02 per share versus the same period a year ago. Of course, the big question is the impact that we saw from weather, namely, the very warm winter that we experienced. The good news is that with the various decoupling mechanisms we have in place for certain of our regulated utilities, the weather impact is much less than it might have been. But there was still an $8 million after-tax impact for our regulated utilities or $0.10 per share as shown on the slide.
There is also a $2 million after-tax impact due to weather for Integrys Energy Services. Consequently, given the warmer winter weather in the first quarter of 2012 and depending on the Illinois retail electric aggregation results that are still unfolding for Integrys Energy Services, we expect that we may be towards the lower end of our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.35 to $3.55.
Slide six provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. While the warmer winter weather had an adverse impact on our quarterly earnings, it was beneficial for our Accelerated Main Replacement Program in Chicago. During the first quarter of 2012, we were able to install a little over 25 miles of new pipe. We estimate that we will be able to install close to 200 miles of new pipe during 2012 compared with the 154 miles we installed in 2011. As we mentioned previously, we expect recovery of this investment through traditional ratemaking as part of our 2012 rate order and the 2013 Peoples Gas rate case which will be filed in August.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant is progressing. In addition, we plan to seek approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on a certificate of authority for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 unit, sometime in the second quarter, and we expect Commission approval in early 2013. On the rate case front, Wisconsin Public Service filed its 2012 rate case on March 30, for new rates effective January 1, 2013. In Minnesota, the Administrative Law Judge issued a draft decision in Minnesota Energy Resources rate proceedings in early April with the final decision expected in the second half of 2012. Summary of the recent rate cases can be found on slides 21 through 26 in the appendix.
Turning to slide seven, I’ll provide some comments regarding the operations of Integrys Energy Services. There were a number of circumstances that adversely impacted first quarter results. I mentioned earlier that weather had a negative impact. If you look at the earnings variance drivers page in our news release or on slide 36 in the appendix of today’s presentation, you’ll see that the increasing competition, the performance of our legacy power plant assets and margins, all had a negative effect on Integrys Energy Services operations this past quarter. But despite these headwinds, there is good news to report at our non-regulated segment. First of all, our customer retention remains strong. Beginning with 2012, we are now tracking retention in three different ways, by customer count, volumes and margins. During the first quarter of 2012 our retention rate was 95% or better for customer count and margins, and 86% for volumes.
As we mentioned in our news release, contracts with several large lower margin customers expired at the end of 2011 and consequently affected the volume retention rate. And although delivered natural gas and electric volumes for 2012 were down quarter-over-quarter, contracted volumes as of March 31, 2012 for the balance of the year were up. This is shown on slide 28 in the appendix. And although it’s not depicted on slide 28, I’ll note that forward contracted volumes for 2012 and beyond are up as well with natural gas up 5% and electric up over 9%. This last bit of data can be found on page 3 of the financial supplement in our earnings release.
Direct mass marketing for retail electric in Illinois had very good growth in the first quarter of 2012. We added 11,000 non-aggregation electric customers during the first quarter, increasing our total to 44,000 non-aggregation customers at March 31, 2012. We also added 30,000 electric aggregation customers during the first three months of 2012 bringing the total count of aggregation customers under contract as of March 31, to 74,000. And recently as a result of municipal voting in Illinois we were awarded 85,000 aggregation customers from seven different communities. These latest customers will come online in the third quarter.
Aggregation will continue to be an opportunity in Illinois. Thus far in 2012 about 240 communities in Illinois have approved retail electric aggregation during their municipal referendums in March, but less than 20% have chosen a supplier. Integrys Energy Services already has developed a track record of good performance in this space and we will continue to pursue these opportunities where it makes sense. These are typically announced publicly when awarded. We’ll include a consolidated summary as part of our next earnings conference call in August.
I’ll now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe.

I’ll cover our financial results for the first quarter of 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with slide eight. During the first quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared with $1.56 for the same quarter in 2011. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter 2012 was $1.55 compared with $1.57 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the first quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on slides 31 and 32 in the appendix.
On slide nine, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the first quarter of 2012 compared with first quarter of 2011. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 33 through 37. Moving to slide ten, we provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the capital expenditures for Peoples Gas upward to reflect the additional new pipe we expect to install in Chicago this year. As well as an upgrade to a natural gas transmission project called Calumet, which is a $50 million addition in both 2013 and ‘14. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $14 million in 2012 from $10 million. The rest remains the same with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars among the three years for Upper Peninsula Power.
Slide 11 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. Our projected rate base for the three-year period has been revised and is reflected on slide 38 in the appendix. Moving to Slide 12, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing at North Shore Gas in early April which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to slide 13, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 to $3.55. It’s now on an adjusted basis because we are removing the positive $1.9 million after-tax impact of the Illinois tax benefit related to Peoples Energy Production Company. On slide 14, you’ll see the only segment guidance changes in holding company and other to reflect this onetime tax benefit. We have not changed any of the other segment projections that we disclosed during our fourth quarter 2011 conference call on February 29, but as Charlie mentioned, we now expect that we maybe towards the lower end of this guidance range.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

First, continued execution of our business plan by our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses. Our operational excellence initiatives and our cost control efforts will enable us to meet our 2012 financial objectives. Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains in the $3.35 to $3.55 range, but we maybe towards the lower end of range. I’ve described some of the headwinds that we’ve encountered in the first quarter, but I can assure you that we are committed to mitigate these impacts over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We will now open the call for your questions.

Good morning, Ali. With the headwinds that already have been mentioned certainly getting to the mid-point on the Integrys Energy Services guidance range that was provided in February, will be a challenge but there are certainly some positive items that will assist in pushing us toward that range. On slide 36, it talks about the variances from quarter-to-quarter. There were some timing issues that hit in the first quarter of 2012 that will reverse out later this year. Second, the new aggregation loan that we are bringing on in Illinois really won’t start hitting the books until the end of the second quarter and third quarter of this year. And then on slide 28, although delivered volumes were down slightly in the first quarter of 2012 on the gas side, that was primarily driven by weather. Contracted volumes were up, as Charlie mentioned for remainder of 2012.
In the third quarter of last year, we talked about entering the Mid-Atlantic gas market, and we have entered that region and now have gotten our licenses and have started putting some new business on in the Mid-Atlantic region. And then recently we received a license to sell power in the Pepco service territory in Pennsylvania. So that’s another growth area we are looking at in 2012. So all those things combined, we think give us a chance to hit our guidance that we put out in February of this year.

Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed last evening, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday’s news release and slide 41 in the appendix.
Slide 4 today indicates that the presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

I’ll begin by providing a high-level overview of our first quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for 2012 and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $1.55, down $0.02 per share versus the same period a year ago. Of course, the big question is the impact that we saw from weather, namely, the very warm winter that we experienced. The good news is that with the various decoupling mechanisms we have in place for certain of our regulated utilities, the weather impact is much less than it might have been. But there was still an $8 million after-tax impact for our regulated utilities or $0.10 per share as shown on the slide.
There is also a $2 million after-tax impact due to weather for Integrys Energy Services. Consequently, given the warmer winter weather in the first quarter of 2012 and depending on the Illinois retail electric aggregation results that are still unfolding for Integrys Energy Services, we expect that we may be towards the lower end of our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.35 to $3.55.
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. While the warmer winter weather had an adverse impact on our quarterly earnings, it was beneficial for our accelerated main replacement program in Chicago. During the first quarter of 2012, we were able to install a little over 25 miles of new pipe. We estimate that we will be able to install close to 200 miles of new pipe during 2012 compared with the 154 miles we installed in 2011. As we mentioned previously, we expect recovery of this investment through traditional ratemaking as part of our 2012 rate order and the 2013 Peoples Gas rate case, which will be filed in August.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant is progressing. In addition, we plan to seek approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on a certificate of authority for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 unit sometime in the second quarter, and we expect commission approval in early 2013. On the rate-case front, Wisconsin Public Service filed its 2012 rate case on March 30 for new rates effective January 1, 2013. In Minnesota, the administrative law judge issued a draft decision in Minnesota Energy Resources rate proceedings in early April with the final decision expected in the second half of 2012. Summary of the recent rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 26 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 7, I’ll provide some comments regarding the operations of Integrys Energy Services. There were a number of circumstances that adversely impacted first quarter results. I mentioned earlier that weather had a negative impact. If you look at the earnings variance drivers page in our news release or on Slide 36 in the Appendix of today’s presentation, you’ll see that the increasing competition, the performance of our legacy power plant assets and margins, all had a negative effect on Integrys Energy Services’ operations this past quarter. 
But despite these headwinds, there is good news to report at our non-regulated segment. First of all, our customer retention remains strong. Beginning with 2012, we are now tracking retention in 3 different ways: by customer count, volumes and margins. During the first quarter of 2012 our retention rate was 95% or better for customer count and margins, and 86% for volumes.
As we mentioned in our news release, contracts with several large lower-margin customers expired at the end of 2011 and consequently affected the volume retention rate. And although delivered natural gas and electric volumes for 2012 were down quarter-over-quarter, contracted volumes as of March 31, 2012 for the balance of the year were up. This is shown on Slide 28 in the Appendix. And although it’s not depicted on Slide 28, I’ll note that forward contracted volumes for 2012 and beyond are up as well with natural gas up 5% and electric up over 9%. This last bit of data can be found on Page 3 of the financial supplement in our earnings release.
Direct mass marketing for retail electric in Illinois had very good growth in the first quarter of 2012. We added 11,000 non-aggregation electric customers during the first quarter, increasing our total to 44,000 non-aggregation customers at March 31, 2012. We also added 30,000 electric aggregation customers during the first 3 months of 2012, bringing the total count of aggregation customers under contract as of March 31, to 74,000. And recently, as a result of municipal voting in Illinois, we were awarded 85,000 aggregation customers from 7 different communities. These latest customers will come online in the third quarter.
Aggregation will continue to be an opportunity in Illinois. Thus far in 2012 about 240 communities in Illinois have approved retail electric aggregation during their municipal referendums in March, but less than 20% have chosen a supplier. Integrys Energy Services already has developed a track record of good performance in this space and we will continue to pursue these opportunities where it makes sense. These are typically announced publicly when awarded. We’ll include a consolidated summary as part of our next earnings conference call in August.
I’ll now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe."

I’ll cover our financial results for the first quarter of 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with Slide 8, during the first quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared with $1.56 for the same quarter in 2011. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter 2012 was $1.55, compared with $1.57 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the first quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 31 and 32 in the Appendix.
On Slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the first quarter of 2012 compared with first quarter of 2011. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the Appendix on Slides 33 through 37. Moving to Slide 10, we provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the capital expenditures for Peoples Gas upward to reflect the additional new pipe we expect to install in Chicago this year, as well as an upgrade to a natural gas transmission project called Calumet, which is a $50 million addition in both 2013 and ‘14. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $14 million in 2012 from $10 million. The rest remains the same, with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars among the 3 years for Upper Peninsula Power.
Slide 11 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. Our projected rate base for the 3-year period has been revised and is reflected on Slide 38 in the Appendix. Moving to Slide 12, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing at North Shore Gas in early April, which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 13, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 to $3.55. It’s now on an adjusted basis because we are removing the positive $1.9 million after-tax impact of the Illinois tax benefit related to Peoples Energy Production Company. On Slide 14, you’ll see the only segment guidance change is in holding company and others to reflect this onetime tax benefit. We have not changed any of the other segment projections that we disclosed during our fourth quarter 2011 conference call on February 29, but as Charlie mentioned, we now expect that we may be towards the lower end of this guidance range.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains in the $3.35 to $3.55 range, but we may be towards the lower end of range. I’ve described some of the headwinds that we’ve encountered in the first quarter, but I can assure you that we are committed to mitigate these impacts over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.

On Slide 36, it talks about the variances from quarter-to-quarter. There were some timing issues that hit in the first quarter of 2012 that will reverse out later this year. Second, the new aggregation loan that we are bringing on in Illinois really won’t start hitting the books until the end of the second quarter and third quarter of this year. And then on Slide 28, although delivered volumes were down slightly in the first quarter of 2012 on the gas side, that was primarily driven by weather. Contracted volumes were up, as Charlie mentioned for the remainder of 2012. In the third quarter of last year, we talked about entering the Mid-Atlantic gas market, and we have entered that region and now have gotten our licenses and have started putting some new business on in the Mid-Atlantic region. And then recently we received a license to sell power in the PECO service territory in Pennsylvania. So that’s another growth area we are looking at in 2012. So all those things combined we think give us a chance to hit our guidance that we put out in February of this year."

Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer of Utilities is unable to make today’s call due to an American Gas Association event. As many of you know Larry is the 2012 Chairman of AGA. The slides supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investors, select Presentations and then today’s presentation. Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through August 7, 2012.
I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed summary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed last evening, the forward-looking statements section of yesterday’s news release and slide 41 in the appendix.
Slide 4 today indicates that the presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"
315149,145604039,303972,"Integrys Energy Group, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Integrys Holding, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

I’ll begin by providing a high-level overview of our first quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for 2012 and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $1.55, down $0.02 per share versus the same period a year ago. Of course, the big question is the impact that we saw from weather, namely, the very warm winter that we experienced. The good news is that with the various decoupling mechanisms we have in place for certain of our regulated utilities, the weather impact is much less than it might have been. But there was still an $8 million after-tax impact for our regulated utilities or $0.10 per share as shown on the slide.
There is also a $2 million after-tax impact due to weather for Integrys Energy Services. Consequently, given the warmer winter weather in the first quarter of 2012 and depending on the Illinois retail electric aggregation results that are still unfolding for Integrys Energy Services, we expect that we may be towards the lower end of our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.35 to $3.55.
Slide 6 provides a brief operational update on our regulated utilities. While the warmer winter weather had an adverse impact on our quarterly earnings, it was beneficial for our accelerated main replacement program in Chicago. During the first quarter of 2012, we were able to install a little over 25 miles of new pipe. We estimate that we will be able to install close to 200 miles of new pipe during 2012 compared with the 154 miles we installed in 2011. As we mentioned previously, we expect recovery of this investment through traditional ratemaking as part of our 2012 rate order and the 2013 Peoples Gas rate case, which will be filed in August.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant is progressing. In addition, we plan to seek approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on a certificate of authority for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 unit sometime in the second quarter, and we expect commission approval in early 2013. On the rate-case front, Wisconsin Public Service filed its 2012 rate case on March 30 for new rates effective January 1, 2013. In Minnesota, the administrative law judge issued a draft decision in Minnesota Energy Resources rate proceedings in early April with the final decision expected in the second half of 2012. Summary of the recent rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 26 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 7, I’ll provide some comments regarding the operations of Integrys Energy Services. There were a number of circumstances that adversely impacted first quarter results. I mentioned earlier that weather had a negative impact. If you look at the earnings variance drivers page in our news release or on Slide 36 in the Appendix of today’s presentation, you’ll see that the increasing competition, the performance of our legacy power plant assets and margins, all had a negative effect on Integrys Energy Services’ operations this past quarter. 
But despite these headwinds, there is good news to report at our non-regulated segment. First of all, our customer retention remains strong. Beginning with 2012, we are now tracking retention in 3 different ways: by customer count, volumes and margins. During the first quarter of 2012 our retention rate was 95% or better for customer count and margins, and 86% for volumes.
As we mentioned in our news release, contracts with several large lower-margin customers expired at the end of 2011 and consequently affected the volume retention rate. And although delivered natural gas and electric volumes for 2012 were down quarter-over-quarter, contracted volumes as of March 31, 2012 for the balance of the year were up. This is shown on Slide 28 in the Appendix. And although it’s not depicted on Slide 28, I’ll note that forward contracted volumes for 2012 and beyond are up as well with natural gas up 5% and electric up over 9%. This last bit of data can be found on Page 3 of the financial supplement in our earnings release.
Direct mass marketing for retail electric in Illinois had very good growth in the first quarter of 2012. We added 11,000 non-aggregation electric customers during the first quarter, increasing our total to 44,000 non-aggregation customers at March 31, 2012. We also added 30,000 electric aggregation customers during the first 3 months of 2012, bringing the total count of aggregation customers under contract as of March 31, to 74,000. And recently, as a result of municipal voting in Illinois, we were awarded 85,000 aggregation customers from 7 different communities. These latest customers will come online in the third quarter.
Aggregation will continue to be an opportunity in Illinois. Thus far in 2012 about 240 communities in Illinois have approved retail electric aggregation during their municipal referendums in March, but less than 20% have chosen a supplier. Integrys Energy Services already has developed a track record of good performance in this space and we will continue to pursue these opportunities where it makes sense.

I’ll cover our financial results for the first quarter of 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with Slide 8, during the first quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared with $1.56 for the same quarter in 2011. This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter 2012 was $1.55, compared with $1.57 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the first quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 31 and 32 in the Appendix.
On Slide 9, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the first quarter of 2012 compared with first quarter of 2011. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the Appendix on Slides 33 through 37. Moving to Slide 10, we provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the capital expenditures for Peoples Gas upward to reflect the additional new pipe we expect to install in Chicago this year, as well as an upgrade to a natural gas transmission project called Calumet, which is a $50 million addition in both 2013 and ‘14. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $14 million in 2012 from $10 million. The rest remains the same, with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars among the 3 years for Upper Peninsula Power.
Slide 11 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. Our projected rate base for the 3-year period has been revised and is reflected on Slide 38 in the Appendix. Moving to Slide 12, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing at North Shore Gas in early April, which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 13, our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 to $3.55. It’s now on an adjusted basis because we are removing the positive $1.9 million after-tax impact of the Illinois tax benefit related to Peoples Energy Production Company. On Slide 14, you’ll see the only segment guidance change is in holding company and others to reflect this onetime tax benefit. We have not changed any of the other segment projections that we disclosed during our fourth quarter 2011 conference call on February 29, but as Charlie mentioned, we now expect that we may be towards the lower end of this guidance range.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize the highlights from this morning as shown on Slide 15. First, continued execution of our business plan by our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses. Our operational excellence initiatives and our cost control efforts will enable us to meet our 2012 financial objectives. Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis remains in the $3.35 to $3.55 range, but we may be towards the lower end of range. I’ve described some of the headwinds that we’ve encountered in the first quarter, but I can assure you that we are committed to mitigate these impacts over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to expect growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We will now open the call for your questions."

With the headwinds that already have been mentioned, certainly getting to the mid-point of the Integrys Energy Services guidance range that was provided in February will be a challenge but there are certainly some positive items that will assist in pushing us toward that range. On Slide 36, it talks about the variances from quarter-to-quarter. There were some timing issues that hit in the first quarter of 2012 that will reverse out later this year. Second, the new aggregation loan that we are bringing on in Illinois really won’t start hitting the books until the end of the second quarter and third quarter of this year. And then on Slide 28, although delivered volumes were down slightly in the first quarter of 2012 on the gas side, that was primarily driven by weather. Contracted volumes were up, as Charlie mentioned for the remainder of 2012. In the third quarter of last year, we talked about entering the Mid-Atlantic gas market, and we have entered that region and now have gotten our licenses and have started putting some new business on in the Mid-Atlantic region. And then recently we received a license to sell power in the PECO service territory in Pennsylvania. So that’s another growth area we are looking at in 2012. So all those things combined we think give us a chance to hit our guidance that we put out in February of this year."

Before we begin, I will advice everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through November 2, 2012.
I need to direct you to slide three of our presentation and to point out that the presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed commentary on the forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed and the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release and slide 46 in the appendix.
Slide four indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

I am going to begin with our high-level overview of our second quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for the remainder of 2012, and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Before I begin, there are two key messages I would like you to keep in mind. First, as seen from our earnings release, we saw a decline in earnings from the quarter and first half of the year compared to 2011. The reason for this on the utility side is weather, and the reason on retail marketing side is the effects of competitive pressures.
My second key message is that the fundamentals of our businesses are strong. We are continuing to execute on our plan to provide value primarily from our utilities with the complimentary earnings provided by our non-utility operations.
So please turn to slide five. In the second quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.26, down $0.12 per share versus the same quarter a year ago. The primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter decline was unseasonably warm weather impacting our regulated natural gas utilities. Warmer than normal weather had a $12 million or $0.15 negative impact on our consolidated financial results for the quarter.
For the first half of 2012, the 20% to 25% warmer than normal weather had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather. With this adverse weather impact on our natural gas utility segment, along with increased competitive pressure on our non-regulated energy services business unit, after the revision of our 2012 guidance range for diluted earnings per share adjusted to between $3 and $3.15. And Joe will have more to say on this in Joe’s formal remarks.
Despite the reduced guidance range our primary businesses, the regulated utilities are executing according to plan and our non-regulated business unit is establishing a strong foundation for future growth. And the next couple of slides will illustrate this.
Let's look at the operations of our regulated utilities summarized on slide six. Our Peoples Gas accelerated Main Replacement Activity in Chicago continues to outpace what we accomplished a year ago. In the second quarter of 2012 we installed another 55 miles of main, 17 miles more than we installed in the second quarter of 2011. During the first six months of 2012, we replaced 80 miles of main and are on-track to achieve our 200 mile target for 2012.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant continues to progress as planned. We are also seeking approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 power plant. We anticipate a decision from the Commission in early 2013, which will allow construction to begin shortly thereafter.
On the rate case front, we received a written order from Minnesota Energy Resources rate case in July and we expect new rates to be implemented in the fall of 2012. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin completed its audit of our WPS rate case in July. Finally, we filed rate cases for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas on July 31. Summary of the recent rate cases can be found on slides 21 through 24 in the appendix.
Please turn to slide 7 as I discuss the operations of Integrys Energy Services. Despite the challenges of increased competition and warmer than normal weather, Integrys Energy Services was able to slightly improve its performance over the same quarter last year and showed growth in contracted volumes for the period. Our total retail forward book volumes are also greater for both natural gas and electric as of June 30th of this year compared to last year.
Our customer retention rate remain strong as measured by customer counts, volume and margins. Although our contracted margins are up, delivered volumes for retail natural gas are bound in the first half of 2012 compared with the first half of 2011 and delivered retail electric volumes are virtually flat over the same period.
The decline on the natural gas volumes is primarily due to the unseasonably warm winter weather which mainly affects our smaller weather sensitive customers. Delivered retail electric volumes were a little less than what we expected primarily due to increased competition. Increased competition is also the driver for the declines in retail electric unit margins over the comparison periods. We have included some details on delivered and contracted volumes and on margins on slides 26 and 27 in the appendix.
Given the current competitive environment, retail electric municipal acquisition results in Illinois are slightly behind our 2012 expectations. As of June 30, 2012 we have 32 communities contracted under the Illinois municipal aggregation program and about 243,000 small electric customers in Illinois.
We expect these growth opportunities to extend into 2013 due to more than 100 additional Illinois communities of size that are expected to put electric aggregation under municipal belt in November. The performance of Integrys Energy Services over these last few months in the face of stiff competition demonstrates that we have the foundation ion place to compete effectively and we are poised for controlled growth consistent with the change in strategy that we began three years ago.
Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to repeat that despite the change in our guidance range, the fundamentals of our businesses remain solid. Our utilities including our interest in The American Transmission Company are performing well and providing the bulk of our earnings and our retail marketing businesses positioned for controlled growth to provide complimentary earning stream with an appropriate risk and returns.
I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe?

Beginning with slide eight, during the second quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 compared with $0.37 for the same quarter in 2011.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we had made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter 2012 is $0.26 compared with $0.38 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the second quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on slides 29 and 30 in the appendix.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012 we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 compared with $1.93 for the comparable period in 2011. We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the six month period in 2012 and 2011. Our six months 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $1.80 for 2012 versus $1.95 in 2011. More comparative information on the six months results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on slide 36 and 37 in the appendix.
Note that we have now included separate charts on slide eight to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share. As we have said in the past, decoupling at each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois commerce commission’s amended order and the Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than it had been in the past.
As Charlie mentioned, in the first half of 2012, the negative weather impact across the Integrys Energy Group net of decoupling was approximately $27 million or $0.34 per share. This reflects a negative financial impact of reserves established in the second quarter against regulatory assets for the decoupling earnings that we may not be able to retain due to recent ICC and court decisions in Illinois. We believe we have a strong argument that the ICC had authority to approve a permanent decoupling mechanism and continue to defend a decoupling mechanism in the [inaudible] process.
However, based on the current situation which the ICC stated that the decoupling revenues are now subject to refund in Illinois as the Illinois Appellate Court overturns the decoupling mechanism in order to refund if any amounts collected, and the fact that several other but different riders have recently been overturned, we believe that recovery of amounts calculated as recoverable. Under the permanent decoupling mechanism is not certain enough to record the reserve.
On slide 9 and 10 we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segments for the second quarter 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011 and six months 2012 compared with the six months 2011 respectively. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on slides 31 through 35 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and slide 38 through 42 for the six months over six months comparison.
Moving to slide 11, we provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the Wisconsin Public Service capital expenditures downward by $133 million to reflect the deduction of certain environmental expenditures in all three years. For example, we eliminated a number of projects scheduled for our Fulham [ph] and Weston generating plants based on the state of regulations and most notably fabric filters with Fulham units five, six, seven, and eight that represented significant dollars. We have determined that we can meet articulating mission requirements with modifications to existing equipment and has budgeted for those projects. We also made a minor adjustment downward to the capital expenditures for Upper Peninsula Power in 2012.
You will also note that we increased the projected capital expenditures for Integrys Energy Services by $9 million in 2012, and this was driven by anticipated solo investors. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $19 million in 2012 from $14 million. The rest remains the same as presented in May with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars between 2012 and 2013 for Integrys Business Support.
Slide 12 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. This slide has not changed since last quarter’s conference call. Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been reduced from our projections provided in May of this year and is reflected on slide 43 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We renewed a number of credit facilities in June at the parent holding company as well as for Peoples Gas and Wisconsin Public Service in an aggregate amount to $100 million less than what was previously outstanding. This is by design due to our reducing for collateral support requirements. In early April we completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing for North Shore Gas which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas in 2012 as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to slide 14, we have provided our revised 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted with detail by segments. On slide 15 we have provided the changes in our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted. And you can see the biggest changes are reduction to the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather earlier this year which includes the impact of recent ITC and court rulings in Illinois related to the decoupling and writers.
We also anticipate a reduction to Integrys Energy Services projected results in part and to increase competitive pressures for retail electric which impact both unit margins and volume growth expectations along with warmer than normal weather impacting retail natural gas sales. These reductions have been offset slightly by expected improvements in regulated electric utility and electric transmission segments.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

Our risk profile today is commensurate with that regulated, non-regulated mix.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3 and $3.15. Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost-control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives.
And we continue to work towards growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015. Given our solid long term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings flow over time.
We will now open the call for your questions.

We do have - if you think back just a couple of years we have had challenges in front of us. Bonus depreciation doesn’t help utility growth that much, reduced ROEs in our utilities. But we’ve been able to overcome those things and as I look ahead as our generation strategy, I mean utility side evolves there is potential opportunity there, and there is other things that we are looking at that could give us prudent investment opportunities that would also help our growth. So kind of the bottom line is we are still working towards it. We see opportunities that will help us get there, but the mix of utility, non-utility will be a little bit different.

One is on the timing of your earnings adjustment for the full year.

And then in terms of weather, when you made earnings on the - first quarter earnings in May, most of the weather was behind you. So I wonder whether at the time of May you were able to look at what happened in the first quarter on the services segment, and also look at the weather, whether you were able to actually make an announcement, the downward adjustment at that time or why did you have to wait till second quarter? And I have two other questions.

So let me talk about the weather first. What happened is in the second quarter there was an ICC order that because of accounting rules caused us to interpret that order as requiring us - and I don’t know the exact accounting terms Joe does, but basically to say that we probably won’t be able to collect those decoupling revenues. Fundamentally that’s what it’s saying. So that happened in the second quarter and in fact if you look in our first quarter 10-Q there were some preliminary orders from the ICC that we had actually disclosed at that time saying that we were watching those things.
On the Integrys Energy Services side we did talk about the headwinds or the competitive pressures that we were seeing in the first quarter, but we also had a number of opportunities opening up to us in the second quarter, Illinois aggregation was the biggest of those and there are a handful of others that as we looked at it, it looked very promising. So it was only until after we went through those various opportunities and looked at where we were at for the rest of the year that we concluded it was time to make a change.

You made a large pension contribution for the first six months, and can you just give us a sense in terms of why that was - what are the assumptions that went in or why did you increase that, and also how should I think about it going forward? I'm also going to put in the third question which is kind of related to that. As a result of the pension and CapEx and the other factors, your cash is now somewhere around $25 million and already you said that you don’t foresee any equity need for this year. How does that change your debt and equity need for the rest of the year and also going forward?

Let me see if I can recap some of those. First of all you asked what's driving our contributions to the pension and benefit plans and we still have quite a bit of cash coming in as a result of bonus appreciation allowed by the current income tax rules. And we are utilizing some of that to make contributions into those forms to help increase the funding levels which we think is appropriate to do. I think the next question was what impact is that going to have on our equity needs for 2012?
As I mentioned before we don’t plan on issuing any equity in 2012 for the remainder of the year. We have not given any guidance relative to the timing of any future equity issuances. However, on a consolidated basis we generally try to maintain our equity at about a 50% to 55% level of our total capital.

Delivering formal remarks with me today are Charlie Schrock, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe O’Leary, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other executives including Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Utilities; Mark Radtke, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Integrys Energy Group; and Dan Verbanac, President of Integrys Energy Services are available for the question-and-answer session at the conclusion of our formal remarks.
The slide supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investors, select presentations and then today’s presentation. Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through November 2, 2012.
I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that the presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation whether a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed commentary on the forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed and the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release and Slide 46 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

I am going to begin with a high-level overview of our second quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for the remainder of 2012 and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Before I begin, there are 2 key messages I would like you to keep in mind. First, as seen from our earnings release, we saw a decline in earnings from the quarter and first half of the year compared to 2011. The reason for this on the utility side is weather, and the reason on the retail marketing side is the effects of competitive pressures.
My second key message is that the fundamentals of our businesses are strong. We are continuing to execute on our plan to provide value primarily from our utilities with the complimentary earnings provided by our non-utility operations.
So please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.26 per share, down $0.12 per share versus the same quarter a year ago. The primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter decline was unseasonably warm weather impacting our regulated natural gas utilities. Warmer than normal weather had a $12 million or $0.15 negative impact on our consolidated financial results for the quarter.
For the first half of 2012, the 20% to 25% warmer than normal weather had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather. With this adverse weather impact on our natural gas utility segment, along with increased competitive pressure on our non-regulated energy services business unit, prompted a revision of our 2012 guidance range for diluted earnings per share adjusted to between $3 and $3.15. And Joe will have more to say on this in his formal remarks.
Despite the reduced guidance range our primary businesses, the regulated utilities are executing according to plan and our non-regulated business unit is establishing a strong foundation for future growth. And the next couple of slides will illustrate this.
Let's look at the operations of our regulated utilities summarized on Slide 6. Our Peoples Gas accelerated Main Replacement Activity in Chicago continues to outpace what we accomplished a year ago. In the second quarter of 2012 we installed another 55 miles of main, 17 miles more than we installed in the second quarter of 2011. During the first 6 months of 2012, we replaced 80 miles of main and are on-track to achieve our 200 mile target for 2012.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant continues to progress as planned. We are also seeking approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 power plant. We anticipate a decision from the Commission in early 2013, which will allow construction to begin shortly thereafter.
On the rate case front, we received a written order from Minnesota Energy Resources rate case in July and we expect new rates to be implemented in the fall of 2012. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin completed its audit of our WPS rate case in July. Finally, we filed rate cases for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas on July 31. Summaries of the recent rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix.
Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the operations of Integrys Energy Services. Despite the challenges of increased competition and warmer than normal weather, Integrys Energy Services was able to slightly improve its performance over the same quarter last year and showed growth in contracted volumes for the period. Our total retail forward book volumes are also greater for both natural gas and electric as of June 30th of this year compared to last year.
Our customer retention rate remains strong as measured by customer count, volume and margins. Although our contracted margins are up, delivered volumes for retail natural gas are down in the first half of 2012 compared with the first half of 2011 and delivered retail electric volumes are virtually flat over the same period.
The decline on the natural gas volumes is primarily due to the unseasonably warm winter weather which mainly affects our smaller weather sensitive customers. Delivered retail electric volumes were a little less than what we expected primarily due to increased competition. Increased competition is also a driver for the declines in retail electric unit margins over the comparison periods. We have included some details on delivered and contracted volumes and on margins on Slides 26 and 27 in the appendix.
Given the current competitive environment, retail electric municipal acquisition results in Illinois are slightly behind our 2012 expectations. As of June 30, 2012 we had 32 communities contracted under the Illinois municipal aggregation program and about 243,000 small electric customers in Illinois.
We expect these growth opportunities to extend into 2013 due to more than 100 additional Illinois communities of size that are expected to put electric aggregation under municipal ballots in November. The performance of Integrys Energy Services over these last few months in the face of stiff competition demonstrates that we have the foundation in place to compete effectively and we are poised for controlled growth consistent with the change in strategy that we began 3 years ago.
Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to repeat that despite the change in our guidance range, the fundamentals of our businesses remain solid. Our utilities, including our interest in The American Transmission Company, are performing well and providing the bulk of our earnings and our retail marketing businesses positioned for controlled growth to provide complimentary earning stream with an appropriate risk and returns.
I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Beginning with Slide 8, during the second quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 compared with $0.37 for the same quarter in 2011.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we had made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter 2012 is $0.26 compared with $0.38 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the second quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 29 and 30 in the appendix.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 compared with $1.93 for the comparable period in 2011. We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the 6 month period in 2012 and 2011. Our 6 months 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $1.80 in 2012 versus $1.95 in 2011. More comparative information on the 6 months results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on Slides 36 and 37 in the appendix.
Note that we have now included separate charts on Slide 8 to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share. As we have said in the past, decoupling at each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois commerce commission’s amended order and the Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than they had been in the past.
As Charlie mentioned, in the first half of 2012, the negative weather impact across the Integrys Energy Group net of decoupling was approximately $27 million or $0.34 per share. This reflects a negative financial impact of reserves established in the second quarter against regulatory assets for the decoupling earnings that we may not be able to retain due to recent ICC and court decisions in Illinois. We believe we have a strong argument that the ICC had authority to approve a permanent decoupling mechanism and continued to defend a decoupling mechanism in the apellate process.
However, based on the current situation which the ICC stated that the decoupling revenues are now subject to refund in Illinois as the Illinois Appellate Court overturns the decoupling mechanism in order to refund of any amounts collected, and the fact that several other but different riders have recently been overturned, we believe that recovery of amounts calculated as recoverable. Under the permanent decoupling mechanism is not certain enough to record the reserve.
On Slide 9 and 10 we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segments for the second quarter 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011 and 6 months 2012 compared with the 6 months 2011 respectively. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 31 through 35 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and Slides 38 through 42 for the 6 months over 6 months comparison.
Moving to Slide 11, we’ve provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the Wisconsin Public Service capital expenditures downward by $133 million to reflect reduction of certain environmental expenditures in all 3 years. For example, we eliminated a number of projects scheduled for our Pulliam and Weston generating plants based on the state of regulations and most notably fabric filters with Pulliam units 5, 6, 7, and 8 that represented significant dollars. We have determined that we can meet articulating mission requirements with modifications to existing equipment and have budgeted for those projects. We also made a minor adjustment downward to the capital expenditures for Upper Peninsula Power in 2012.
You will also note that we increased the projected capital expenditures for Integrys Energy Services by $9 million in 2012, and this was driven by anticipated solar investments. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $19 million in 2012 from $14 million. The rest remains the same as presented in May with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars between 2012 and 2013 for Integrys Business Support.
Slide 12 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. This slide has not changed since last quarter’s conference call. Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been reduced from our projections provided in May of this year and is reflected on Slide 43 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We renewed a number of credit facilities in June at the parent holding company as well as for Peoples Gas and Wisconsin Public Service in an aggregate amount to $100 million less than what was previously outstanding. This is by design due to our reduced need for collateral support requirements. In early April we completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing for North Shore Gas which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas in 2012 as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 14, we have provided our revised 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted with detail by segment. On Slide 15 we have provided the changes in our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted. As you can see, the biggest changes are reduction to the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather earlier this year which includes the impact of recent ITC and court rulings in Illinois related to the decoupling and riders.
We also anticipate a reduction to Integrys Energy Services projected results in part due to increased competitive pressures for retail electric which impact both unit margins and volume growth expectations along with warmer than normal weather impacting retail natural gas sales. These reductions have been offset slightly by expected improvements in the regulated electric utility and electric transmission segments.

First, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track. And our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected. We have a solid foundation for controlled growth at Integrys Energy Services. We expect our regulated businesses to contribute approximately 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses comprised almost entirely of Integrys Energy Services to contribute the remaining 10%. Our risk profile today is commensurate with that regulated, non-regulated mix.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3 and $3.15. Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost-control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives.
And we continue to work towards growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015. Given our solid long term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings slow over time.

Actually I was pretty pleased with what we saw coming out of our non utility business, the retail business.

And even doing all of that we were able to grow our contracted volumes for the year and for our total forward book. So to me that’s very promising. And as Dan described we have a number of tools if you will of opportunities to offer services in different areas and services to customers who really appreciate the type of things that we provide.

One is on the timing of your earnings adjustment for the full year. And I'm looking at Slide 27 and aside from the unrealized gain your second quarter gross margin pretty are much on par with the year before. The shortfall seems to be coming from the first quarter. And then in terms of weather, when you made earnings on the -- first quarter earnings in May, most of the weather was behind you. So I wonder whether at the time of May you were able to look at what happened in the first quarter on the services segment, and also look at the whether you were able to actually make an announcement about the downward adjustment at that time or why did you have to wait till second quarter? And I have two other questions."

So let me talk about the weather first. What happened is in the second quarter there was an ICC order that because of accounting rules caused us to interpret that order as requiring us -- and I don’t know the exact accounting terms, Joe does, but basically to say that we probably won’t be able to collect those decoupling revenues. Fundamentally that’s what it’s saying. So that happened in the second quarter and in fact if you look in our first quarter 10-Q there were some preliminary orders from the ICC that we had actually disclosed at that time saying that we were watching those things.
On the Integrys Energy Services side we did talk about the headwinds or the competitive pressures that we were seeing in the first quarter, but we also had a number of opportunities opening up to us in the second quarter, Illinois aggregation was the biggest of those and there are a handful of others that as we looked at it, it looked pretty promising. So it was only until after we went through those various opportunities and looked at where we were at for the rest of the year that we concluded it was time to make a change."

And then the second question is regarding the cash flow statement. You made a large pension contribution for the first 6 months, and can you just give us a sense in terms of why that was -- what are the assumptions that went in there or why did you increase that, and also how should I think about it going forward? I'm also going to put in the third question which is kind of related to that. As a result of the pension and CapEx and a few other factors, your cash is now somewhere around $25 million and earlier you said that you don’t foresee any equity need for this year. How does that change your debt and equity need for the rest of the year and also going forward?"

Let me see if I can recap some of those. First of all you asked what's driving our contributions to the pension and benefit plans and we still have quite a bit of cash coming in as a result of bonus appreciation allowed by the current income tax rules. And we are utilizing some of that to make contributions into those funds to help increase the funding levels which we think is appropriate to do. I think the next question was what impact is that going to have on our equity needs for 2012?
As I mentioned before we don’t plan on issuing any equity in 2012 for the remainder of the year. We have not given any guidance relative to the timing of any future equity issuances. However, on a consolidated basis we generally try to maintain our equity at about a 50% to 55% level of our total capital."

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through November 2, 2012.
I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that the presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation whether a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This slide is a condensed commentary on the forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on form 10-Q we filed and the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release and Slide 46 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings and/or loss. We believe that these are useful financial measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

I am going to begin with a high-level overview of our second quarter 2012 financial results and operational highlights. Joe will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide a summary of our financial outlook for the remainder of 2012 and as usual we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Before I begin, there are 2 key messages I would like you to keep in mind. First, as seen from our earnings release, we saw a decline in earnings from the quarter and first half of the year compared to 2011. The reason for this on the utility side is weather, and the reason on the retail marketing side is the effects of competitive pressures.
My second key message is that the fundamentals of our businesses are strong. We are continuing to execute on our plan to provide value primarily from our utilities with the complimentary earnings provided by our non-utility operations.
So please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter of 2012 we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.26 per share, down $0.12 per share versus the same quarter a year ago. The primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter decline was unseasonably warm weather impacting our regulated natural gas utilities. Warmer than normal weather had a $12 million or $0.15 negative impact on our consolidated financial results for the quarter.
For the first half of 2012, the 20% to 25% warmer than normal weather had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather. With this adverse weather impact on our natural gas utility segment, along with increased competitive pressure on our non-regulated energy services business unit, prompted a revision of our 2012 guidance range for diluted earnings per share adjusted to between $3 and $3.15. And Joe will have more to say on this in his formal remarks.
Despite the reduced guidance range our primary businesses, the regulated utilities are executing according to plan and our non-regulated business unit is establishing a strong foundation for future growth. And the next couple of slides will illustrate this.
Let's look at the operations of our regulated utilities summarized on Slide 6. Our Peoples Gas accelerated Main Replacement Activity in Chicago continues to outpace what we accomplished a year ago. In the second quarter of 2012 we installed another 55 miles of main, 17 miles more than we installed in the second quarter of 2011. During the first 6 months of 2012, we replaced 80 miles of main and are on-track to achieve our 200 mile target for 2012.
At Wisconsin Public Service, the environmental retrofit project for our jointly owned Columbia power plant continues to progress as planned. We are also seeking approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for environmental retrofits at our Weston 3 power plant. We anticipate a decision from the Commission in early 2013, which will allow construction to begin shortly thereafter.
On the rate case front, we received a written order from Minnesota Energy Resources rate case in July and we expect new rates to be implemented in the fall of 2012. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin completed its audit of our WPS rate case in July. Finally, we filed rate cases for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas on July 31. Summaries of the recent rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix.
Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the operations of Integrys Energy Services. Despite the challenges of increased competition and warmer than normal weather, Integrys Energy Services was able to slightly improve its performance over the same quarter last year and showed growth in contracted volumes for the period. Our total retail forward book volumes are also greater for both natural gas and electric as of June 30th of this year compared to last year.
Our customer retention rate remains strong as measured by customer count, volume and margins. Although our contracted margins are up, delivered volumes for retail natural gas are down in the first half of 2012 compared with the first half of 2011 and delivered retail electric volumes are virtually flat over the same period.
The decline on the natural gas volumes is primarily due to the unseasonably warm winter weather which mainly affects our smaller weather sensitive customers. Delivered retail electric volumes were a little less than what we expected primarily due to increased competition. Increased competition is also a driver for the declines in retail electric unit margins over the comparison periods. We have included some details on delivered and contracted volumes and on margins on Slides 26 and 27 in the appendix.
Given the current competitive environment, retail electric municipal acquisition results in Illinois are slightly behind our 2012 expectations. As of June 30, 2012 we had 32 communities contracted under the Illinois municipal aggregation program and about 243,000 small electric customers in Illinois.
We expect these growth opportunities to extend into 2013 due to more than 100 additional Illinois communities of size that are expected to put electric aggregation under municipal ballots in November. The performance of Integrys Energy Services over these last few months in the face of stiff competition demonstrates that we have the foundation in place to compete effectively and we are poised for controlled growth consistent with the change in strategy that we began 3 years ago.
Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to repeat that despite the change in our guidance range, the fundamentals of our businesses remain solid. Our utilities, including our interest in The American Transmission Company, are performing well and providing the bulk of our earnings and our retail marketing businesses positioned for controlled growth to provide complimentary earning stream with an appropriate risk and returns.
I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

I’ll cover our financial results for 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with Slide 8, during the second quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for th",1088,"Thank you, Charlie. I’ll cover our financial results for 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with Slide 8, during the second quarter of 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 compared with $0.37 for the same quarter in 2011.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we had made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter of 2012. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the second quarter 2012 is $0.26 compared with $0.38 in the same period in 2011. More comparative information on the second quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 29 and 30 in the appendix.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.86 compared with $1.93 for the comparable period in 2011. We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the 6 month period in 2012 and 2011. Our 6 months 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $1.80 in 2012 versus $1.95 in 2011. More comparative information on the 6 months results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on Slides 36 and 37 in the appendix.
Note that we have now included separate charts on Slide 8 to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share. As we have said in the past, decoupling at each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois commerce commission’s amended order and the Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than they had been in the past.
As Charlie mentioned, in the first half of 2012, the negative weather impact across the Integrys Energy Group net of decoupling was approximately $27 million or $0.34 per share. This reflects a negative financial impact of reserves established in the second quarter against regulatory assets for the decoupling earnings that we may not be able to retain due to recent ICC and court decisions in Illinois. We believe we have a strong argument that the ICC had authority to approve a permanent decoupling mechanism and continued to defend a decoupling mechanism in the apellate process.
However, based on the current situation which the ICC stated that the decoupling revenues are now subject to refund in Illinois as the Illinois Appellate Court overturns the decoupling mechanism in order to refund of any amounts collected, and the fact that several other but different riders have recently been overturned, we believe that recovery of amounts calculated as recoverable. Under the permanent decoupling mechanism is not certain enough to record the reserve.
On Slide 9 and 10 we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segments for the second quarter 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011 and 6 months 2012 compared with the 6 months 2011 respectively. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 31 through 35 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and Slides 38 through 42 for the 6 months over 6 months comparison.
Moving to Slide 11, we’ve provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. The key segment drivers remain the same with environmental retrofits at Wisconsin Public Service for the electric utilities and the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago for the natural gas utilities.
We’ve adjusted the Wisconsin Public Service capital expenditures downward by $133 million to reflect reduction of certain environmental expenditures in all 3 years. For example, we eliminated a number of projects scheduled for our Pulliam and Weston generating plants based on the state of regulations and most notably fabric filters with Pulliam units 5, 6, 7, and 8 that represented significant dollars. We have determined that we can meet articulating mission requirements with modifications to existing equipment and have budgeted for those projects. We also made a minor adjustment downward to the capital expenditures for Upper Peninsula Power in 2012.
You will also note that we increased the projected capital expenditures for Integrys Energy Services by $9 million in 2012, and this was driven by anticipated solar investments. Additionally, we’ve revised our equity contribution to American Transmission Company to $19 million in 2012 from $14 million. The rest remains the same as presented in May with the exception of some shifting of capital expenditure dollars between 2012 and 2013 for Integrys Business Support.
Slide 12 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. This slide has not changed since last quarter’s conference call. Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been reduced from our projections provided in May of this year and is reflected on Slide 43 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 13, you will see our financing summary for 2012. We renewed a number of credit facilities in June at the parent holding company as well as for Peoples Gas and Wisconsin Public Service in an aggregate amount to $100 million less than what was previously outstanding. This is by design due to our reduced need for collateral support requirements. In early April we completed a $28 million 3.43% interest rate long-term financing for North Shore Gas which will mature in 15 years. We still expect to complete long-term financing transactions for Wisconsin Public Service and Peoples Gas in 2012 as we previously discussed, without the need to issue common stock in 2012.
Turning to Slide 14, we have provided our revised 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted with detail by segment. On Slide 15 we have provided the changes in our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted. As you can see, the biggest changes are reduction to the natural gas utility segment due to warmer weather earlier this year which includes the impact of recent ITC and court rulings in Illinois related to the decoupling and riders.
We also anticipate a reduction to Integrys Energy Services projected results in part due to increased competitive pressures for retail electric which impact both unit margins and volume growth expectations along with warmer than normal weather impacting retail natural gas sales. These reductions have been offset slightly by expected improvements in the regulated electric utility and electric transmission segments.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

First, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track. And our 34% ownership in American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected. We have a solid foundation for controlled growth at Integrys Energy Services. We expect our regulated businesses to contribute approximately 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses comprised almost entirely of Integrys Energy Services to contribute the remaining 10%. Our risk profile today is commensurate with that regulated, non-regulated mix.
Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3 and $3.15. Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost-control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives.
And we continue to work towards growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015. Given our solid long term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings slow over time.

We do have -- if you think back just a couple of years we have had challenges put in front of us. Bonus depreciation doesn’t help utility growth that much, reduced ROEs in our utilities. But we’ve been able to overcome those things and as I look ahead as our generation strategy, on the utility side evolves there is potential opportunity there, and there is other things that we are looking at that could give us prudent investment opportunities that would also help our growth.

On the Integrys Energy Services side we did talk about the headwinds or the competitive pressures that we were seeing in the first quarter, but we also had a number of opportunities opening up to us in the second quarter, Illinois aggregation was the biggest of those and there are a handful of others that as we looked at it, it looked pretty promising.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 26, 2013.  
Before I begin the formal part of today’s program, I want to say I hope this call finds all of you listeners doing well, particularly those of you on the east coast.  As most of you know, my shoes are here in Illinois but my roots are back east, and Hurricane Sandy had an impact on my family in Long Island and in Connecticut.  They are doing well and I hope that this call finds the same true for all of you.  On behalf of all of us at Integrys Energy Group, you are in our thoughts during this trying time.
Now, I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.  Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements.  Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.  This slide is a condensed commentary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on Form 10-Q we filed, the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release, and Slide 50 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted, and adjusted earnings or loss.  We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?

Let me echo Steve’s comments to those of you affected by Hurricane Sandy.  By many measures, this was one of the worst, if not the worst storm in United States history.  It had devastating effects on millions of people on the east coast and they are all in our thoughts.  The response to restore power from the electric industry has been overwhelming.  Over 65,000 utility workers from across the country, including Wisconsin public service line electricians, mechanics and supervisors are helping the local utilities.  Our crews are helping Connecticut Light and Power in their restoration efforts.  I commend and thank our workers and all of the responders who are working in treacherous conditions to restore power as soon as possible; and as Steve said, for those of you joining us today who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, on behalf of my fellow Integrys Energy Group colleagues, we hope that your lives soon return to a more normal state.
I’ll begin today by providing a high level overview of our third quarter 2012 financial results, operational highlights over the last few months, and our expectations for the balance of 2012.  Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide more information regarding our financial outlook.  As usual, we will conclude with a question and answer session.
Please turn to Slide 5.  In the third quarter of 2012, we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.55 per share, up $0.13 per share from the same period a year ago.  The primary quarter-over-quarter drivers were rate increases for People’s Gas, North Shore Gas, and Upper Peninsula Power, as well as lower expenses at the electric utilities.  These items more than offset lower sales volumes at the regulated natural gas utilities due to lower use per residential customer and lower sales volumes from wholesale customers at the electric utility.
For the nine months of 2012, the warmer than normal weather during the heating season had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 per share negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather, driving the period over period decline in adjusted earnings.  Although the third quarter of 2012 was also warmer than normal, the impact of weather on our year-to-date results did not change materially from what we disclosed last quarter as a decoupling mechanism at Wisconsin Public Service offset the electric sales increase.  
Before I move on to our segment highlights, I’m pleased to report that mostly due to continued cost control efforts by our employees, we are expecting earnings to be more than projected in August and are revising our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted upward to $3.22 to $3.38.  Joe will provide more detail on this in a few minutes.
But before I turn the call over to Joe, I’ll summarize the recent developments for our regulated utilities.  I mentioned on our last call that our strategy for our electric supply portfolio for Wisconsin Public Service was evolving.  As you’ve seen, there has been some significant progress on that evolving strategy with our announcements of the pending purchase of the Fox Energy Center and Dominion’s recent announcement that they will shut down the Kewaunee nuclear plant next year.  
Slide 6 addresses our Fox Energy Center transaction.  The state regulatory approval process has been initiated and federal regulatory approvals will be requested before year-end.  We are on a path for approvals to be secured for a targeted April 1, 2013 closing.  Joe will have more to say on the impact of this acquisition on 2013 earnings and financing in a few minutes.
Slide 7 highlights the other developments at our regulated utilities.  In October, Dominion Resources announced that they will be shutting down the Kewaunee nuclear plant in mid-2013.  Wisconsin Public Service has an electric supply contract for 330 megawatts of electricity from Kewaunee nuclear plant that runs through December 21 of 2013.  Dominion has indicated that it will continue to honor its contract with Wisconsin Public Service by providing electricity purchased on the open market after the plant is shut down.  The shut down of the Kewaunee plant is not expected to impact reliability as Wisconsin Public Service has sufficient reserves and will continue to have a diversified power supply portfolio that will provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable electricity.
The accelerated natural gas main replacement program for People’s Gas continues to move forward.  The amount of our investment this year is on target; however, we expect that the miles of main we will be able to install this year will be between 130 and 135 miles instead of the 200 miles we had anticipated earlier in the year.  Increased compliance requirements in the City of Chicago and changes in our internal processes are adding some additional costs and more work to the project, thus limiting the amount of main that we will replace this year.
Next, our rate cases are proceeding.  The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin verbally approved the Wisconsin Public Service rate case settlement.  The rate cases for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas are in progress with updates filed for anticipated increase costs primarily related to modifications in natural gas main and service pipe installation procedures, and due to new regulations from the Chicago Department of Transportation.  Rates for Minnesota Energy Resources are expected to be final in December 2012.  Slides 23 through 26 in the appendix have more details on the rate cases.
Slide 8 provides a brief summary of the developments for our non-regulated energy segment.  The highlight is that Integrys Energy Services reached agreements to sell three of its four legacy merchant generation assets - the Westwood, Beaver Falls, and Syracuse generating facilities.  We expect to close these transactions over the next several months.  As we mentioned previously, these assets are not core to our restructured non-regulated energy marketing business and our plan has always contemplated that they would be sold if appropriate opportunities arose.  
For the non-regulated energy marketing business, unit margins for new business remain lower than historical levels and overall realized unit margins are lower compared with the same quarter last year due to continued competitive pressure.  However, our contracted future volumes are up substantially for both retail natural gas and retail electric, even though there has been little additional growth within Illinois aggregation since last quarter.  We expect to continue to grow sales volumes as opportunities exist not only in Illinois but also in other portions of our footprint.
I will now turn this call over to Joe O’Leary.  Joe?

This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we’ve made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter of 2012.  The discontinued operations line item relates to the three legacy power plants that Integrys Energy Services has contracted for sale, as Charlie just described.  In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was authorized a recovery of $5.9 million related to income tax amounts expensed in 2010 and 2011 as a result of the federal Healthcare Reform Act.  As a result, a regulatory asset was recorded at September 30, 2012 and had a positive impact on our third quarter 2012 GAAP results.  Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter 2012 was $0.55 compared with $0.42 for the same quarter in 2011.  More comparative information on the third quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 33 and 34 in the appendix.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.69 compared with $2.39 for the comparable period in 2011.  We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the nine months in 2012 and 2011.  Our nine month 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $2.37 in 2012 versus $2.38 in 2011.  More comparative information on the nine month results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on Slides 40 and 41 in the appendix.
Note that we have again included separate tables on Slide 9 to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share.  As we have said in the past, decoupling in each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois Commerce Commission’s revised amendatory order in the People’s Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than they have been in the past.  You will note that the weather impact has essentially stayed the same as we disclosed in our previous conference call as the warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of 2012 was offset as a result of our electric decoupling mechanism for Wisconsin Public Service.
On Slides 10 and 11, we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011, and nine months 2012 compared with the nine months 2011 respectively.  Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 39 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and Slides 42 through 46 for the nine month over nine month comparisons.
Moving to Slide 12, we’ve provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014.  There are a number of changes that I will summarize for you.  At Wisconsin Public Service, the increase in 2013 is primarily related to the recently announced Fox Energy Center acquisition, and the increase in 2014 is due to undergrounding of electric distribution lines in certain areas in Wisconsin.  We have increased the projected capital expenditures for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas over the three-year period primarily due to increased costs related to our accelerated main replacement program. 
There is also a change in 2013 for Michigan Gas Utilities related to an anticipated increase primarily for main installation and replacement and related equipment.  The increase for Integrys business support is for a planned enhancement to the customer support system.  Other changes from what we provided in the second quarter include refinements related to the timing and amounts for construction projects at our subsidiaries and the equity contributions for the American Transmission Company.  We no longer expect to make equity contributions to INDU Solar LLC in 2012 as it has been able to internally finance its solar projects, so we’ve removed the line for INDU Solar from the table.
Slide 13 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014.  Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been adjusted from our projections provided in August of this year and is reflected on Slide 47 in the appendix.  
Moving to Slide 14, you’ll see our financing summary for 2012.  Changes have been made to our long-term debt transactions expected in 2012.  We have refined the Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt financing to a more definitive $300 million from the $250 million to $300 million range that we reported last August.  Additionally in October 2012, People’s Gas secured commitments for a $100 million in long-term financing with delayed draw in December of 2012.
Moving to Slide 15, let me give you a summary of how the Fox Energy Center acquisition is expected to impact our financial results in 2013.  In our application for a certificate of authority to purchase the Fox Energy Center filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on October 12, 2013, Wisconsin Public Service is requesting any revenue requirements related to costs in excess of the capacity payments and the cost of imputed debt of $54 million be deferred with recovery to occur in conjunction with future rate proceedings.  This would also include equity earnings on the incremental average rate base amount in 2013.  Generally accepted accounting principles permit the creation of a regulatory asset related to this for future recovery, but the deferred earnings cannot be recorded as income until such recovery is proved and included in the revenue requirements in a subsequent rate case.  The sum total of the regulatory treatment we are requesting is that we expect no meaningful impact on Integrys Energy Group’s consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted in 2013.  
Moving on to our expected financing for the Fox Energy Center acquisition, at closing we will finance this at Wisconsin Public Service using a combination of short-term debt and cash flow from operations.  Later in 2013, the short-term debt will be replaced with longer term financing in conjunction with the overall Integrys Energy Group business needs comprised of any of the following:  new Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt, new Integrys Energy Group hybrid debt that would receive partial equity treatment in our capital structure, our anticipated balance sheet would support a new issue of up to $400 million of hybrid debt, and if needed up to $150 million of new Integrys Energy Group common equity.  Our ultimate goal is maintaining adequate liquidity and financial health while continuing to provide our shareholders with an attractive investment opportunity.
Given that we are early in the Fox Energy Center approval process, we are not prepared to elaborate on specific amounts or pin down any timing of when such financing will occur.  This provides more meaningful guidelines for Integrys Energy Group going forward.  Our financing plans for Integrys Energy Group are expected to support our current credit rating.  Combined with our long-term strategic plan and portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable.  Our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.
Turning to Slide 16, we have provided you with our revised and approved guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted by segment.  If you turn to Slide 17, you will see how our revised guidance improved by comparing it to what we presented to you in August.  Improvements essentially come from the regulated electric and regulated natural gas segments, and these upward adjustments are primarily due to lower employee benefit costs and lower other operations and maintenance expenses at the utilities.  There are some other slight modifications to diluted earnings per share adjusted for the other segments.
Now I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize our key investment highlights which are consistent with what we shared three months ago.  Please turn to Slide 18.
Importantly, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track.  We have taken steps to ensure our electric customers continue to have safe, reliable and affordable power, and our accelerated main replacement program continues.  Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute earnings as expected.
We have a solid foundation for growth at Integrys Energy Services.  We expect our regulated businesses to contribute approximately 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses, comprised almost entirely of Integrys Energy Services, to contribute the remaining 10%.  Our business risk profile today is commensurate with this mix of regulated and non-regulated businesses.  Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has improved to be in the range of $3.22 and $3.38.  
Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives.  We continue to work toward growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4 to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.  The events that transpired since our last earnings conference call demonstrate this.  Given our solid long-term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.
We will now open the call for your questions.

So we’ll utilize some long-term debt at Wisconsin Public Service.  Right now, we said it’s roughly $440 million - that’s what we had in our press release - so at the subsidiary level, you figure $220 million roughly of long-term debt at some point in the future in 2013.  The rest would be an equity contribution received from the parent.  Now, that equity contribution from the parent would be financed in conjunction with the rest of Integrys Energy Group’s financing needs for 2013, and for those needs we expect to use a combination of hybrid debt and as needed up to $150 million of new common equity.

Unit margins certainly vary by customer size and region, and obviously the larger industrial customers have the most competitive pressures.  But year-to-date 2012, our electric realized unit margins are $6.63 on the power side, which is about a dollar lower than 2011, and our gas margins are pretty much flat this year.  You can see that on Slide 30.  We certainly expect realized unit margins to continue to drift down over the next couple of years, but remember a lot of our 2013 business was contracted in 2010 to 2011 when margins were higher.  We are certainly very disciplined in how we price our products to make an acceptable return, and that certainly won’t change in this highly competitive environment; but we do focus on customers where we can add value beyond commodity price alone, and our target market or kind of our sweet spot on the C&I business has been that small and medium-sized customer.
So as unit margins continue to drift lower over the next couple years, we fully expect we can grow overall margins or top line margins by increasing volume.  In most of the regions that we operate today, we have a single-digit market share, so growing 25% or 50% in those regions is certainly not unreasonable, and our contracted forward volumes for the third quarter of this year compared to last year is up 26% on the power side and over 20% on the gas side, so we are seeing significant growth there.

And at the same time, we had Integrys Energy Services facing the competitive pressures, so we reduced he guidance there.  And at that point in time, we didn’t really have a lot of insight into what we might be able to do with O&M cost controls and other trends that we were seeing.
So cast forward to today, I think the good news is we challenged ourselves as an organization, because we didn’t like where we were there, to see what we could do with cost control, and that’s been primarily the reason that the utilities are doing better.  In addition to your question on confidence, it has a lot to do with the fact that we’re three more months into the year, so we have nine months of good data now.  And frankly, the data is all pointing to these numbers that we’re sharing with you today.

On the parent company level, there are some costs associated with debt, but for the most part the difference—you know, short-term debt is relatively inexpensive right now, and we think we can carry it in short-term for a while and delay the longer term financing until a little later in the year, and the equity, the timing of that would—again, as I mentioned before, that’s kind of the swing component in the overall financing plan.

Overall, we try to keep our equity at roughly between 50 and 55% at the holding company level on a consolidated basis for Integrys Energy Group.  So when we’re thinking about the 50 to 55% equity, we take into consideration hybrid debt, which is treated as it has equity attributes provided by either Moody’s or S&P, differing amounts but nonetheless it does have some equity attributes.  So as we increase the balance sheet for the acquisition, as the balance sheet grows from that acquisition, we end up have the capacity to take on additional hybrid debt that we didn’t have without that acquisition, so it does kind of open up that financing capability for us.

And especially with the dividend that you pay and everything, to me this all noise, nuisance, and very hard to model for a utility management company.  
So I look at WEC as your competitor because the other third utility is in Iowa and Wisconsin.  They are a pure utility company, have the highest multiple.  They never miss guidance.  They never go down guidance; they always go up, and they have been doing to for four or five years in a row and the reason is because their businesses are reliable, it’s a utility business, it’s a certainty.  Here, we have guidance going up, down, up, down, up.  Some of it is about the utility business; some of it is from the retail.  I just don’t understand how the Board can have a business which has so much ups and downs on margins and all that tie in with a regulated business which is 100% certainty, gives you a pure dividend from which your stock.

The slides supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our website at www.integrysgroup.com, select Investors, select Presentation, and then today’s presentation.  Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 26, 2013.
Before I begin the formal part of today’s program, I want to say I hope this call finds all of you listeners doing well, particularly those of you on the East Coast.  As most of you know, my shoes are here in Illinois but my roots are Back East, and Hurricane Sandy had an impact on my family in Long Island and in Connecticut.  They are doing well and I hope that this call finds the same true for all of you.  On behalf of all of us at Integrys Energy Group, you are in our thoughts during this trying time.
Now I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.  Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements.  Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise.  This slide is a condensed commentary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on Form 10-Q we filed, the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release, and Slide 50 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted, and adjusted earnings or loss.  We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?"

Let me echo Steve’s comments to those of you affected by Hurricane Sandy.  By many measures, this was one of the worst, if not the worst storm in United States history.  It had devastating effects on millions of people on the East Coast and they are all in our thoughts.  The response to restore power from the electric industry has been overwhelming.  Over 65,000 utility workers from across the country, including Wisconsin Public Service line electricians, mechanics and supervisors, are helping the local utilities.  Our crews are helping Connecticut Light and Power in their restoration efforts.  I commend and thank our workers and all of the responders who are working in treacherous conditions to restore power as soon as possible; and as Steve said, for those of you joining us today who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, on behalf of my fellow Integrys Energy Group colleagues, we hope that your lives soon return to a more normal state.
I’ll begin today by providing a high level overview of our third quarter 2012 financial results, operational highlights over the last few months, and our expectations for the balance of 2012.  Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide more information regarding our financial outlook.  As usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Please turn to Slide 5.  In the third quarter of 2012, we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.55 per share, up $0.13 per share from the same period a year ago.  The primary quarter-over-quarter drivers were rate increases for People’s Gas, North Shore Gas, and Upper Peninsula Power, as well as lower expenses at the electric utilities.  These items more than offset lower sales volumes at the regulated natural gas utilities due to lower use per residential customer and lower sales volumes from wholesale customers at the electric utility.
For the 9 months of 2012, the warmer than normal weather during the heating season had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 per share negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather, driving the period-over-period decline in adjusted earnings.  Although the third quarter of 2012 was also warmer than normal, the impact of weather on our year-to-date results did not change materially from what we disclosed last quarter as a decoupling mechanism at Wisconsin Public Service offset the electric sales increase.
Before I move on to our segment highlights, I’m pleased to report that mostly due to continued cost control efforts by our employees, we are expecting earnings to be more than projected in August and are revising our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted upwards to $3.22 to $3.38.  Joe will provide more detail on this in a few minutes.
But before I turn the call over to Joe, I’ll summarize the recent developments for our regulated utilities.  I mentioned on our last call that our strategy for our electric supply portfolio for  Wisconsin Public Service was evolving.  As you’ve seen, there has been some significant progress on that evolving strategy with our announcements of the pending purchase of the Fox Energy Center and Dominion’s recent announcement that they will shut down the Kewaunee nuclear plant next year.
Slide 6 addresses our Fox Energy Center transaction.  The state regulatory approval process has been initiated and federal regulatory approvals will be requested before year-end.  We are on a path for approvals to be secured for a targeted April 1, 2013 closing.  Joe will have more to say on the impact of this acquisition on 2013 earnings and financing in a few minutes.
Slide 7 highlights the other developments at our regulated utilities.  In October, Dominion Resources announced that they will be shutting down the Kewaunee nuclear plant in mid-2013.  Wisconsin Public Service has an electric supply contract for 330 megawatts of electricity from Kewaunee nuclear plant that runs through December 21 of 2013.  Dominion has indicated that it will continue to honor its contract with Wisconsin Public Service by providing electricity purchased on the open market after the plant is shut down.  The shut down of the Kewaunee plant is not expected to impact reliability as Wisconsin Public Service has sufficient reserves and will continue to have a diversified power supply portfolio that will provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable electricity.
The accelerated natural gas main replacement program for People’s Gas continues to move forward.  The amount of our investment this year is on target; however, we expect that the miles of main we will be able to install this year will be between 130 and 135 miles instead of the 200 miles we had anticipated earlier in the year.  Increased compliance requirements in the City of Chicago and changes in our internal processes are adding some additional costs and more work to the project, thus limiting the amount of main that we will replace this year.
Next, our rate cases are proceeding.  The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin verbally approved the Wisconsin Public Service rate case settlement.  The rate cases for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas are in progress with updates filed for anticipated increase costs primarily related to modifications in natural gas main and service pipe installation procedures, and due to new regulations from the Chicago Department of Transportation.  Rates for Minnesota Energy Resources are expected to be final in December 2012.  Slides 23 through 26 in the appendix have more details on the rate cases.
Slide 8 provides a brief summary of the developments for our non-regulated energy segment.  The highlight is that Integrys Energy Services reached agreements to sell 3 of its 4 legacy merchant generation assets, the Westwood, Beaver Falls, and Syracuse generating facilities.  We expect to close these transactions over the next several months.  As we mentioned previously, these assets are not core to our restructured non-regulated energy marketing business and our plan has always contemplated that they would be sold if appropriate opportunities arose.
For the non-regulated energy marketing business, unit margins for new business remain lower than historical levels and overall realized unit margins are lower compared with the same quarter last year due to continued competitive pressure.  However, our contracted future volumes are up substantially for both retail natural gas and retail electric, even though there has been little additional growth within Illinois aggregation since last quarter.  We expect to continue to grow sales volumes as opportunities exist not only in Illinois but also in other portions of our footprint.
I will now turn this call over to Joe O’Leary.  Joe?"

I’ll cover our financial results for 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted.  Beginning with Slide 9, during the third quarter of 2012 we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 compared with $0.47 for the same quarter in 2011.  Based upon anticipated pretax proceeds totaling approximately $8 million for the Westwood, Beaver Falls and Syracuse generating units, we recorded an after-tax impairment of these assets of $7.4 million in the quarter, and this is included in discontinued operations.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we’ve made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter of 2012.  The discontinued operations line item relates to the 3 legacy power plants that Integrys Energy Services has contracted for sale, as Charlie just described.  In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was authorized a recovery of $5.9 million related to income tax amounts expensed in 2010 and 2011 as a result of the federal Healthcare Reform Act.  As a result, a regulatory asset was recorded at September 30, 2012 and had a positive impact on our third quarter 2012 GAAP results.  Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter 2012 was $0.55 compared with $0.42 for the same quarter in 2011.  More comparative information on the third quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 33 and 34 in the appendix.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.69 compared with $2.39 for the comparable period in 2011.  We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the 9 months in 2012 and 2011.  Our 9 month 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $2.37 in 2012 versus $2.38 in 2011.  More comparative information on the 9 month results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on Slides 40 and 41 in the appendix.
Note that we have again included separate tables on Slide 9 to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share.  As we have said in the past, decoupling in each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois Commerce Commission’s revised amendatory order in the People’s Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than they have been in the past.  You will note that the weather impact has essentially stayed the same as we disclosed in our previous conference call as the warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of 2012 was offset as a result of our electric decoupling mechanism for Wisconsin Public Service.
On Slides 10 and 11, we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011, and 9 months 2012 compared with the 9 months 2011 respectively.  Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 39 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and Slides 42 through 46 for the 9 month over 9 month comparisons.
Moving to Slide 12, we’ve provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014.  There are a number of changes that I will summarize for you.  At Wisconsin Public Service, the increase in 2013 is primarily related to the recently announced Fox Energy Center acquisition, and the increase in 2014 is due to undergrounding of electric distribution lines in certain areas in Wisconsin.  We have increased the projected capital expenditures for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas over the three-year period primarily due to increased costs related to our accelerated main replacement program.
There is also a change in 2013 for Michigan Gas Utilities related to an anticipated increase primarily for main installation and replacement and related equipment.  The increase for Integrys business support is for a planned enhancement to the customer support system.  Other changes from what we provided in the second quarter include refinements related to the timing and amounts for construction projects at our subsidiaries and the equity contributions for the American Transmission Company.  We no longer expect to make equity contributions to INDU Solar LLC in 2012 as it has been able to internally finance its solar projects, so we’ve removed the line for INDU Solar from the table.
Slide 13 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014.  Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been adjusted from our projections provided in August of this year and is reflected on Slide 47 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 14, you’ll see our financing summary for 2012.  Changes have been made to our long-term debt transactions expected in 2012.  We have refined the Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt financing to a more definitive $300 million from the $250 million to $300 million range that we reported last August.  Additionally in October 2012, People’s Gas secured commitments for a $100 million in long-term financing with delayed draw in December of 2012.
Moving to Slide 15, let me give you a summary of how the Fox Energy Center acquisition is expected to impact our financial results in 2013.  In our application for a certificate of authority to purchase the Fox Energy Center filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on October 12, 2013, Wisconsin Public Service is requesting any revenue requirements related to costs in excess of the capacity payments and the cost of imputed debt of $54 million be deferred with recovery to occur in conjunction with future rate proceedings.  This would also include equity earnings on the incremental average rate base amount in 2013.  Generally accepted accounting principles permit the creation of a regulatory asset related to this for future recovery, but the deferred earnings cannot be recorded as income until such recovery is proved and included in the revenue requirements in a subsequent rate case.  The sum total of the regulatory treatment we are requesting is that we expect no meaningful impact on Integrys Energy Group’s consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted in 2013.
Moving on to our expected financing for the Fox Energy Center acquisition. At closing, we will finance this at Wisconsin Public Service using a combination of short-term debt and cash flow from operations.  Later in 2013, the short-term debt will be replaced with longer term financing in conjunction with the overall Integrys Energy Group business needs comprised of any of the following:  New Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt, new Integrys Energy Group hybrid debt that would receive partial equity treatment in our capital structure, our anticipated balance sheet would support a new issue of up to $400 million of hybrid debt, and if needed up to $150 million of new Integrys Energy Group common equity.  Our ultimate goal is maintaining adequate liquidity and financial health while continuing to provide our shareholders with an attractive investment opportunity.
Given that we are early in the Fox Energy Center approval process, we are not prepared to elaborate on specific amounts or pin down any timing of when such financing will occur.  This provides more meaningful guidelines for Integrys Energy Group going forward.  Our financing plans for Integrys Energy Group are expected to support our current credit rating.  Combined with our long-term strategic plan and portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable.  Our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.
Turning to Slide 16, we have provided you with our revised and approved guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted by segment.  If you turn to Slide 17, you will see how our revised guidance improved by comparing it to what we presented to you in August.  Improvements essentially come from the regulated electric and regulated natural gas segments, and these upward adjustments are primarily due to lower employee benefit costs and lower other operations and maintenance expenses at the utilities.  There are some other slight modifications to diluted earnings per share adjusted for the other segments.
Now I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?"

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize our key investment highlights which are consistent with what we shared 3 months ago.  Please turn to Slide 18.
Importantly, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track.  We have taken steps to ensure our electric customers continue to have safe, reliable and affordable power, and our accelerated main replacement program continues.  Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute earnings as expected.
We have a solid foundation for growth at Integrys Energy Services.  We expect our regulated businesses to contribute approximately 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses, comprised almost entirely of Integrys Energy Services, to contribute the remaining 10%.  Our business risk profile today is commensurate with this mix of regulated and non-regulated businesses.  Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has improved to be in the range of $3.22 and $3.38.
Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives.  We continue to work toward growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4 to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.  The events that transpired since our last earnings conference call demonstrate this.  Given our solid long-term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.

Right now, we’ve said that we have a target date of April 1. And then later in 2013, as we look at what the rest of the needs are for the rest of Integrys Energy Group business, we’ll look for longer term financing to kind of take out the short-term financing arrangement that we utilized. So we’ll utilize some long-term debt at Wisconsin Public Service.  Right now, we said it’s roughly $440 million -- that’s what we had in our press release -- so at the subsidiary level, you figure $220 million roughly of long-term debt at some point in the future in 2013.  The rest would be an equity contribution received from the parent.  Now, that equity contribution from the parent would be financed in conjunction with the rest of Integrys Energy Group’s financing needs for 2013. And for those needs, we expect to use a combination of hybrid debt and, as needed, up to $150 million of new common equity."

But year-to-date 2012, our electric realized unit margins are $6.63 on the power side, which is about a dollar lower than 2011, and our gas margins are pretty much flat this year.  You can see that on Slide 30.  We certainly expect realized unit margins to continue to drift down over the next couple of years, but remember a lot of our 2013 business was contracted in 2010 to 2011 when margins were higher.  We are certainly very disciplined in how we price our products to make an acceptable return, and that certainly won’t change in this highly competitive environment; but we do focus on customers where we can add value beyond commodity price alone, and our target market or kind of our sweet spot on the C&I business has been that small- and medium-sized customer. So as unit margins continue to drift lower over the next couple years, we fully expect we can grow overall margins or top line margins by increasing volume.  In most of the regions that we operate today, we have a single-digit market share, so growing 25% or 50% in those regions is certainly not unreasonable, and our contracted forward volumes for the third quarter of this year compared to last year is up 26% on the power side and over 20% on the gas side.

On the parent company level, there are some costs associated with debt, but for the most part the difference -- short-term debt is relatively inexpensive right now, and we think we can carry it in short-term for a while and delay the longer-term financing until a little later in the year. And the equity, the timing of that would -- again, as I mentioned before, that’s kind of the swing component in the overall financing plan.

And especially with the dividend that you pay and everything, to me this is all noise, nuisance, and very hard to model for a utility management company. So I look at WEC as your competitor because the other third utility is in Iowa and Wisconsin.  They are a pure utility company, have the highest multiple.  They never miss guidance.  They never go down guidance, they always go up, and they have been doing to for 4 or 5 years in a row. And the reason is because their businesses are reliable, it’s a utility business, it’s a certainty.  And where here, we have guidance going up, down, up, down, up.  Some of it is about the utility business; some of it is from the retail.  I just don’t understand how the Board can have a business which has so much ups and downs on margins and all that tie in with a regulated business which is 100% certainty, gives you a pure dividend from which your stock is.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through February 26, 2013.
Before I begin the formal part of today’s program, I want to say I hope this call finds all of you listeners doing well, particularly those of you on the East Coast. As most of you know, my shoes are here in Illinois but my roots are Back East, and Hurricane Sandy had an impact on my family in Long Island and in Connecticut. They are doing well and I hope that this call finds the same true for all of you. On behalf of all of us at Integrys Energy Group, you are in our thoughts during this trying time.
Now I need to direct you to Slide 3 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond our ability to control and in many cases we cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events or otherwise. This slide is a condensed commentary on forward-looking statements and you are encouraged to read and understand the more specific language that is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the quarterly report on Form 10-Q we filed, the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release, and Slide 50 in the appendix.
Slide 4 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted, and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide for more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Let me echo Steve’s comments to those of you affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Let me echo Steve’s comments to those of you affected by Hurricane Sandy. By many measures, this was one of the worst, if not the worst storm in United States history. It had devastating effects on millions of people on the East Coast and they are all in our thoughts. The response to restore power from the electric industry has been overwhelming. Over 65,000 utility workers from across the country, including Wisconsin Public Service line electricians, mechanics and supervisors, are helping the local utilities. Our crews are helping Connecticut Light and Power in their restoration efforts. I commend and thank our workers and all of the responders who are working in treacherous conditions to restore power as soon as possible; and as Steve said, for those of you joining us today who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, on behalf of my fellow Integrys Energy Group colleagues, we hope that your lives soon return to a more normal state.
I’ll begin today by providing a high level overview of our third quarter 2012 financial results, operational highlights over the last few months, and our expectations for the balance of 2012. Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financial results in more detail and provide more information regarding our financial outlook. As usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Please turn to Slide 5. In the third quarter of 2012, we posted diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $0.55 per share, up $0.13 per share from the same period a year ago. The primary quarter-over-quarter drivers were rate increases for People’s Gas, North Shore Gas, and Upper Peninsula Power, as well as lower expenses at the electric utilities. These items more than offset lower sales volumes at the regulated natural gas utilities due to lower use per residential customer and lower sales volumes from wholesale customers at the electric utility.
For the 9 months of 2012, the warmer than normal weather during the heating season had an approximate $27 million or $0.34 per share negative impact on our consolidated financial results compared to normal weather, driving the period-over-period decline in adjusted earnings. Although the third quarter of 2012 was also warmer than normal, the impact of weather on our year-to-date results did not change materially from what we disclosed last quarter as a decoupling mechanism at Wisconsin Public Service offset the electric sales increase.
Before I move on to our segment highlights, I’m pleased to report that mostly due to continued cost control efforts by our employees, we are expecting earnings to be more than projected in August and are revising our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted upwards to $3.22 to $3.38. Joe will provide more detail on this in a few minutes.
But before I turn the call over to Joe, I’ll summarize the recent developments for our regulated utilities. I mentioned on our last call that our strategy for our electric supply portfolio for Wisconsin Public Service was evolving. As you’ve seen, there has been some significant progress on that evolving strategy with our announcements of the pending purchase of the Fox Energy Center and Dominion’s recent announcement that they will shut down the Kewaunee nuclear plant next year.
Slide 6 addresses our Fox Energy Center transaction. The state regulatory approval process has been initiated and federal regulatory approvals will be requested before year-end. We are on a path for approvals to be secured for a targeted April 1, 2013 closing. Joe will have more to say on the impact of this acquisition on 2013 earnings and financing in a few minutes.
Slide 7 highlights the other developments at our regulated utilities. In October, Dominion Resources announced that they will be shutting down the Kewaunee nuclear plant in mid-2013. Wisconsin Public Service has an electric supply contract for 330 megawatts of electricity from Kewaunee nuclear plant that runs through December 21 of 2013. Dominion has indicated that it will continue to honor its contract with Wisconsin Public Service by providing electricity purchased on the open market after the plant is shut down. The shutdown of the Kewaunee plant is not expected to impact reliability as Wisconsin Public Service has sufficient reserves and will continue to have a diversified power supply portfolio that will provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable electricity.
The accelerated natural gas main replacement program for People’s Gas continues to move forward. The amount of our investment this year is on target; however, we expect that the miles of main we will be able to install this year will be between 130 and 135 miles instead of the 200 miles we had anticipated earlier in the year. Increased compliance requirements in the City of Chicago and changes in our internal processes are adding some additional costs and more work to the project, thus limiting the amount of main that we will replace this year.
Next, our rate cases are proceeding. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin verbally approved the Wisconsin Public Service rate case settlement. The rate cases for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas are in progress with updates filed for anticipated increase costs primarily related to modifications in natural gas main and service pipe installation procedures, and due to new regulations from the Chicago Department of Transportation. Rates for Minnesota Energy Resources are expected to be final in December 2012. Slides 23 through 26 in the appendix have more details on the rate cases.
Slide 8 provides a brief summary of the developments for our non-regulated energy segment. The highlight is that Integrys Energy Services reached agreements to sell 3 of its 4 legacy merchant generation assets, the Westwood, Beaver Falls, and Syracuse generating facilities. We expect to close these transactions over the next several months. As we mentioned previously, these assets are not core to our restructured non-regulated energy marketing business and our plan has always contemplated that they would be sold if appropriate opportunities arose.
For the non-regulated energy marketing business, unit margins for new business remain lower than historical levels and overall realized unit margins are lower compared with the same quarter last year due to continued competitive pressure. However, our contracted future volumes are up substantially for both retail natural gas and retail electric, even though there has been little additional growth within Illinois aggregation since last quarter. We expect to continue to grow sales volumes as opportunities exist not only in Illinois but also in other portions of our footprint.
I will now turn this call over to Joe O’Leary. Joe?"

I’ll cover our financial results for 2012 and discuss our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted. Beginning with Slide 9, during the third quarter of 2012 we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 compared with $0.47 for the same quarter in 2011. Based upon anticipated pretax proceeds totaling approximately $8 million for the Westwood, Beaver Falls and Syracuse generating units, we recorded an after-tax impairment of these assets of $7.4 million in the quarter, and this is included in discontinued operations.
This slide also sets forth the additions and subtractions we’ve made to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter of 2012. The discontinued operations line item relates to the 3 legacy power plants that Integrys Energy Services has contracted for sale, as Charlie just described. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was authorized a recovery of $5.9 million related to income tax amounts expensed in 2010 and 2011 as a result of the federal Healthcare Reform Act. As a result, a regulatory asset was recorded at September 30, 2012 and had a positive impact on our third quarter 2012 GAAP results. Our diluted earnings per share adjusted for the third quarter 2012 was $0.55 compared with $0.42 for the same quarter in 2011. More comparative information on the third quarters of 2012 and 2011 is reported by segment on Slides 33 and 34 in the appendix.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.69 compared with $2.39 for the comparable period in 2011. We’ve also shown the additions and subtractions to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the 9 months in 2012 and 2011. Our 9 month 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted was $2.37 in 2012 versus $2.38 in 2011. More comparative information on the 9 month results for 2012 and 2011 reported by segment can be found on Slides 40 and 41 in the appendix.
Note that we have again included separate tables on Slide 9 to show the impact of the unusually warm weather compared to normal weather net of decoupling in both dollars and diluted earnings per share. As we have said in the past, decoupling in each of our jurisdictions is not perfect, and given the Illinois Commerce Commission’s revised amendatory order in the People’s Gas and North Shore Gas 2012 rate cases, our financial results are now more sensitive to weather than they have been in the past. You will note that the weather impact has essentially stayed the same as we disclosed in our previous conference call as the warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of 2012 was offset as a result of our electric decoupling mechanism for Wisconsin Public Service.
On Slides 10 and 11, we show the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011, and 9 months 2012 compared with the 9 months 2011 respectively. Additional detail on the key variance drivers for each segment can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 39 for the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and Slides 42 through 46 for the 9 month over 9 month comparisons.
Moving to Slide 12, we’ve provided our capital expenditure plans for 2012 through 2014. There are a number of changes that I will summarize for you. At Wisconsin Public Service, the increase in 2013 is primarily related to the recently announced Fox Energy Center acquisition, and the increase in 2014 is due to undergrounding of electric distribution lines in certain areas in Wisconsin. We have increased the projected capital expenditures for People’s Gas and North Shore Gas over the 3-year period primarily due to increased costs related to our accelerated main replacement program.
There is also a change in 2013 for Michigan Gas Utilities related to an anticipated increase primarily for main installation and replacement and related equipment. The increase for Integrys business support is for a planned enhancement to the customer support system. Other changes from what we provided in the second quarter include refinements related to the timing and amounts for construction projects at our subsidiaries and the equity contributions for the American Transmission Company. We no longer expect to make equity contributions to INDU Solar LLC in 2012 as it has been able to internally finance its solar projects, so we’ve removed the line for INDU Solar from the table.
Slide 13 shows our expected depreciation expense at the regulated utilities for 2012 through 2014. Our projected rate base for 2012 through 2014 has been adjusted from our projections provided in August of this year and is reflected on Slide 47 in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 14, you’ll see our financing summary for 2012. Changes have been made to our long-term debt transactions expected in 2012. We have refined the Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt financing to a more definitive $300 million from the $250 million to $300 million range that we reported last August. Additionally in October 2012, People’s Gas secured commitments for a $100 million in long-term financing with delayed draw in December of 2012.
Moving to Slide 15, let me give you a summary of how the Fox Energy Center acquisition is expected to impact our financial results in 2013. In our application for a certificate of authority to purchase the Fox Energy Center filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on October 12, 2013, Wisconsin Public Service is requesting any revenue requirements related to costs in excess of the capacity payments and the cost of imputed debt of $54 million be deferred with recovery to occur in conjunction with future rate proceedings. This would also include equity earnings on the incremental average rate base amount in 2013. Generally accepted accounting principles permit the creation of a regulatory asset related to this for future recovery, but the deferred earnings cannot be recorded as income until such recovery is proved and included in the revenue requirements in a subsequent rate case. The sum total of the regulatory treatment we are requesting is that we expect no meaningful impact on Integrys Energy Group’s consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted in 2013.
Moving on to our expected financing for the Fox Energy Center acquisition. At closing, we will finance this at Wisconsin Public Service using a combination of short-term debt and cash flow from operations. Later in 2013, the short-term debt will be replaced with longer term financing in conjunction with the overall Integrys Energy Group business needs comprised of any of the following: New Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt, new Integrys Energy Group hybrid debt that would receive partial equity treatment in our capital structure, our anticipated balance sheet would support a new issue of up to $400 million of hybrid debt, and if needed up to $150 million of new Integrys Energy Group common equity. Our ultimate goal is maintaining adequate liquidity and financial health while continuing to provide our shareholders with an attractive investment opportunity.
Given that we are early in the Fox Energy Center approval process, we are not prepared to elaborate on specific amounts or pin down any timing of when such financing will occur. This provides more meaningful guidelines for Integrys Energy Group going forward. Our financing plans for Integrys Energy Group are expected to support our current credit rating. Combined with our long-term strategic plan and portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable. Our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.
Turning to Slide 16, we have provided you with our revised and approved guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted by segment. If you turn to Slide 17, you will see how our revised guidance improved by comparing it to what we presented to you in August. Improvements essentially come from the regulated electric and regulated natural gas segments, and these upward adjustments are primarily due to lower employee benefit costs and lower other operations and maintenance expenses at the utilities. There are some other slight modifications to diluted earnings per share adjusted for the other segments.
Now I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?"

Before taking your questions, I’ll summarize our key investment highlights which are consistent with what we shared 3 months ago. Please turn to Slide 18.
Importantly, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track. We have taken steps to ensure our electric customers continue to have safe, reliable and affordable power, and our accelerated main replacement program continues. Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute earnings as expected.
We have a solid foundation for growth at Integrys Energy Services. We expect our regulated businesses to contribute approximately 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses, comprised almost entirely of Integrys Energy Services, to contribute the remaining 10%. Our business risk profile today is commensurate with this mix of regulated and non-regulated businesses. Our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis has improved to be in the range of $3.22 and $3.38.
Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, our operational excellence initiatives and cost control efforts will enable us to meet our revised 2012 consolidated financial objectives. We continue to work toward growth in diluted earnings per share adjusted of 4 to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015. The events that transpired since our last earnings conference call demonstrate this. Given our solid long-term business plan and our portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.
We will now open the call for your questions."

So we’ll utilize some long-term debt at Wisconsin Public Service. Right now, we said it’s roughly $440 million -- that’s what we had in our press release -- so at the subsidiary level, you figure $220 million roughly of long-term debt at some point in the future in 2013. The rest would be an equity contribution received from the parent. Now, that equity contribution from the parent would be financed in conjunction with the rest of Integrys Energy Group’s financing needs for 2013.

But year-to-date 2012, our electric realized unit margins are $6.63 on the power side, which is about a dollar lower than 2011, and our gas margins are pretty much flat this year. You can see that on Slide 30. We certainly expect realized unit margins to continue to drift down over the next couple of years, but remember a lot of our 2013 business was contracted in 2010 to 2011 when margins were higher. We are certainly very disciplined in how we price our products to make an acceptable return, and that certainly won’t change in this highly competitive environment; but we do focus on customers where we can add value beyond commodity price alone, and our target market or kind of our sweet spot on the C&I business has been that small- and medium-sized customer. So as unit margins continue to drift lower over the next couple years, we fully expect we can grow overall margins or top line margins by increasing volume. In most of the regions that we operate today, we have a single-digit market share, so growing 25% or 50% in those regions is certainly not unreasonable, and our contracted forward volumes for the third quarter of this year compared to last year is up 26% on the power side and over 20% on the gas side.

On the parent company level, there are some costs associated with debt, but for the most part the difference -- short-term debt is relatively inexpensive right now, and we think we can carry it in short-term for a while and delay the longer-term financing until a little later in the year.

I just find having a business where margins go up and down, which is totally opposite of what the utility businesses where margins and ROEs are flat except for the weather variance, the 2 businesses don’t comply with each other. And especially with the dividend that you pay and everything, to me this is all noise, nuisance, and very hard to model for a utility management company. So I look at WEC as your competitor because the other third utility is in Iowa and Wisconsin. They are a pure utility company, have the highest multiple. They never miss guidance. They never go down guidance, they always go up, and they have been doing to for 4 or 5 years in a row. And the reason is because their businesses are reliable, it’s a utility business, it’s a certainty. And where here, we have guidance going up, down, up, down, up. Some of it is about the utility business; some of it is from the retail. I just don’t understand how the Board can have a business which has so much ups and downs on margins and all that tie in with a regulated business which is 100% certainty, gives you a pure dividend from which your stock is.
