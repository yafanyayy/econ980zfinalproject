Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about DTE Energy accomplished in 2011. And that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings",2668,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about DTE Energy accomplished in 2011. And that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings for last year finished well ahead of our plan on our most recent guidance. On our cash flow and balance sheet results were strong for the year as well. 
So 2011 continued a string of solid earnings and cash flow results for the company in recent years. But our performance is about a lot more than about financial results. And in fact, I believe that only by focusing on a lot of things outside of your financial results that your earnings picture has a chance to be strong and sustainable long-term. And so I spend a lot of time with my leadership team focused on a system of interconnected priorities that I believe are the things that we need to be very good at consistently in order to make our recent strong financial performance sustained long-term. There are a lot of companies who produce strong financial performance short-term or for a few years. The trick is to make that sustained long-term, and a lot of discussion here and a lot of focus on how to make that happen. And the system of priorities that we're using to do that is shown on Slide 5, and I'll start by saying I realize that Slide 5 may look like a lot of boxes and arrows to you. But it really is how we're thinking about managing DTE Energy for the long-term. So I want to take a little bit of time describing that system to you and then tell you about the progress we've made against it.
And the priority start on the left side with what I call the kind of the kingpin or key priority which is the highly engaged employees. And the bottom line is you can't have an excellent company that outperforms if your employees focus and engagement and energy level is average. And so we really do spend a lot of time trying to build the energy engagement and focus of our people. And if you pull that off, then you have a chance at the next 3 things, which is to deliver with a good service to your customers and improve that over time. To use a tool that we've spent a lot of time developing here at DTE Energy Continues Improvement in order to manage the quality and affordability of our products. And also to have your people drive greater growth and value creation. And if you do those 3 things well, then I think you have a shot at sustaining a constructive political and regulatory context because your customers are well served, they're all voters and they shape the political arena. If you don't keep your cost in line by constantly working on affordability that eventually finds its way into the political and regulatory discussion. It's also true that if you can pursue constructive productive growth and that helps from an economic standpoint in the state it shapes the political and regulatory context. And if you combine a good regulatory context with solid growth then you have the formula for sustainable financial performance. 
So in terms of how we are progressing against these priorities, Slide 6 steps into that. I mean the employee engagement, we use something called the Gallup survey. Thousands of U.S. companies do use that. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that our Gallup score increased. We're now on the 71st percentile of U.S. companies. That's a good thing although we have a clear goal of wanting to take that up to the top decile or top 10%. We're also continuing to improve our safety performance another important employee outcome. Our injury rate is down 70% since the mid-2000s. We've got both of our utilities performing at top quartile level in fact MichCon has been top decile level in recent years. Continues improvement is something that we work every year to push deeper into the organization through education and familiarization and practice. And as a result, our own MX expense level were lower last year than 2005. We project it will be lower again in 2012 than it was in back in 2005. That's about $350 million inflation adjustment basis. But it isn't only cost obviously we're working to focus that CI on reliability and other important metrics. From a customer satisfaction standpoint, our MPSC complaints are down over 50% over the past 5 years. We have a target of being that down 10% to 15% year in, year out. 2011 also saw improvement in our J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings in both utilities. That's the fifth year in a row that we've seen that. MichCon came in first quartile. Detroit Edison wasn't that hight. They were above median but not at first quartile but they did improve. We also put a lot of work into our work on behalf of low-income customers here in the states. Moving onto Slide 7 on the regulatory and political front. I think when we stepped back from it, the outcome that we had in the Detroit and rate case late last year was constructed. The ROE did come down and we'd hope for a little higher outcome there. But when you think the case overall, I think we've got the base that's constructive work from. And we did continue to see solid and broad political support for the regulatory structure here in the states that was put in place about 4 years ago. And on the growth front, we saw our first major Win Project at Detroit Edison we put about $250,000 into that. I'll talk about that a little bit later. We also made significant progress on 2 new Non-Utility growth platforms. Our Bluestone Project related to the Marcellus and Pennsylvania and our Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. Again, I will talk about those 2 items a little bit later. 
And finally, on the financial front, the outcome of all of the work that I just prescribed. Our earnings were $3.73. EPS was $3.73, compared to our original guidance a year ago was $3.55 a so nice outperform there ROE at Detroit Edison for the second straight year. MichCon was off slightly on its ROE principally due to warm weather that we and everybody saw in November and December last year. And we did increase our dividend 5% last year to $2.35 a share. So I feel we made good progress last year. I also feel good about our launch point for 2012 and I feel about our longer-term prospects which is where I want to turn out. And I will move to Slide 9 to do that. You can see on Slide 9 that we have provided guidance for 2012 to $3.80. That's $0.05 higher than the early outlook that we provided back in November. 
If you compare that $3.80 to the guidance that we've provided a year ago which was $3.55, the 7%. In fact, if you look at the bottom of the slide you can see that our growth in recent years has been righted above the 7% level and we are projecting a future growth of 5% to 6%. We often get asked 5% or 6% at what pace? And want to be cleared at the 5% to 6% is from the mid-point of our put it 12 guidance. Is from that $3.80 level. Now let me talk a minute for where that growth would come from starting with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. 
Detroit Edison will invest about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years, we project. About $4 billion of that, on the left side, will be put into base infrastructure, which is our investments to ensure the reliability of our generation fleet, our distribution systems. 2012 will be just under $800 million in that area. We also have significant expenditures continuing environmental compliance. We can see that we've ranged that from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion in the next 5 years. And the range is simply because we are still finalizing our plans as you know the EPA does continue to evolve regulations and so we may see some changes in the 5-year period that we don't fully understand now. We'll put a little over $350 million in that area in 2012. And then on Renewable Energy, we project just under $1 billion of investment to meet the RPS requirements here in Michigan. We will put $235 million into that arena in 2012. In fact, Slide 11 provides a bit more detail on our renewable investments because this is an area that's really emerged over the past year. You see on the left hand side of Slide 11 our first large investment in wind and that's a 212-megawatt project that will be fully operational by March. We pursued this 50-50 with Invenergy. And all of our turbines, we have 64 turbines on the site are in fact, up and operational. We invested about $250 million into that project. The right-hand side shows you the project we are currently in the midst of. This will be 110 megawatts at 3 sites on what we call bill fund area of Michigan., and we project that will be completed by the end of this year and again, we'll put on the order of $250 million to that project. That's 1 next work began on that last year will little out of the market right now but because of the letter. And following that, we do have in our sights the next project which is also 110-megawatt put on an order of $250 million of investment that would likely play out in the 20132 early 2014 timeframe in terms of completion. Moving onto Slide 12 from MichCon, we project that it will invest $1 billion next 5 years but 2/3 of that in this capital focused on strengthening and expanding the distribution system, pipeline integrity and so forth which is just over $150 million to that area this year. The other 2 areas that are working are both problematic. One of them is main renewal. Our undertaking the program to replace 670 miles of Maine over the next 10 years this $500,000 in the 10 year period. And that's really focused primarily on cast-iron main has just reached end-of-life investments to be replaced. We do plan to file for capital recovery and Megan SMRs our surcharge mechanism in our upcoming rate case from MichCon and we are coordinating that carefully with the public service commission. We'll spend about $40 million in this area this year. We are also pursuing meter move out program. We still have meters inside of; urban areas and we're going to be moving about 27,000 meters per year out. We need to do that but customer services impacted too much by having this insides. So we in the commission have agreed trying to get them outside, and we will invest $20 million to that end this year. We also have some healthy growth opportunities in our non-utility business. And those are the discussion that starts at Slide 13. The 2 areas where our strongest growth opportunities are focused is in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business and our Power & Industrial business. Gas Storage & Pipeline is profiled on the left. It's about a $60 million business but we do believe it can reach $100 million by 2016. And that expansion is driven heavily by investments that are tied to the Marcellus Shale and the Millennium Pipeline and some of the things that we're working. I'll describe more of that in a minute. The right-hand side, is the Power & Industrial earnings profile. It's about a $50 million business this year, that's midpoint of our guidance for 2012. We believe it can grow to about $100 million business or actually above $100 million by 2016. Most of that growth will be driven by a reduce emissions fewer business at least in the near-term. Slide 14 provides more color on our Gas Storage & Pipeline opportunities. In the upper left, we have talked to you previously about the Bluestone pipeline and the associated gathering systems. Bluestone is a lateral pipe. It's really focused on taking Marcellus gas to market. For us it will total about $280 million in investment in the pipe itself and then gathering that we're going to undertake. We are heavily in the works of making that pipe real right now, permitting it right away or well along and wrapping up. This pipe is going to be built in 2 phases. A northern phase face and a southern phase. Our construction on Phase will begin soon. We expect to have that in service this summer. And then Phase II will follow with the in-service late this year. This activity and other developments nearby are driving expansions on the millennium pipe described in the green -- shown on the green and the box in the upper right. This pipe is full. It was really full at the end of last year.  We saw all sorts of activity moving gas in both directions despite just trying to get Marcellus production to market. We have 2 expansions of the pipe locked in. Those will result in a 50% increase in the capacity of the pipe. First expansion coming into play this year and the second next year. But in addition to these investments, we are working on additional future opportunities as well. The Bluestone is anchored by Southwestern Energy but we have been approached by other producers which we feel things that are adjacent to Bluestone. Several of those discussions we expect will continue in eventually progress into additional gas been moved on Bluestone, an additional investment for us. We also continue to work extensions of the Millennium Pipeline, extensions and expansions, to provide greater access to the North East market from ourselves production, and we are optimistic that we will make projects of that nature happen as well. Slide 15 provides an update the second area of significant growth in our Non-Utility businesses. The reduced emissions fuel business within business line within our Power & Industrial business. On the left-hand side of Slide 15, you see where we stood at year end 2011. We had 3 units in service at Detroit Edison plans, to that we have cited in other plants with utilities and in the Midwest and at 4 units available for relocation inciting with other utilities. 
Our earnings contribution last year was under $5 million. And that's slow was because 3 of the units that we had an operation by end of year were only an operation for weeks. They came in like quite late in the year. And those units also add 6 months of depreciation even though they operated only for only a few weeks. So that impacted the earnings. If you look to this year, in the middle of the slide, our focus is making those 5 units that we had cited in and out of operation very well. We're also working on relocating the remaining 4 units and we are in discussions with a number of other utilities to that end. And we expect earnings contribution to go up to the $30 million level. And then looking out to 2013 and beyond, we expect they've all 9 units in operation with an average annual contribution moving forward of $50 million or so. That would be the level we'd expect in 2013. Could drift up some there from -- because these tax credits do inflate over time. But that's a general feel for the level that we see right now for that business. And with that, I am going to turn things over to Dave Meador, who's going to give you a fuller update on our financials. Dave, over to you."
266598,146203225,258701,"DTE Energy Co., 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial update starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded that the reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Startin",1741,"Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial update starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded that the reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Starting on the left-hand side, Deitroit Edison came in higher than our fall EEI guidance and earned $2.60 per share. This was driven by ongoing cost control and the partial year rate increase that we had last year ended favorability is driven by a onetime year-end tax adjustment. But second year on the your Detroit Edison unzipped authorized return on equity. This content at $0.65 per share this was at the low end of the debt is slightly below our targeted 11% return on equity levels. This con was on track for almost the entire year due to ongoing pest controls. The mild weather got us at the end of the year and cost a slightness there. And the Non-Utility group Gas Storage & Pipeline $0.34 per share this is higher volumes on the pipelines in the fourth quarter. 
Power & Industrial finished the year at the high-end of the guidance range. This was a transition year for the group. And adds several parties to deliver higher-than-expected returns and some one-time items. Energy Trading finished up strong for the year $0.31. And as you might recall, trading posted solid earnings through the third quarter and we saw that performance continue throughout the remainder of the year. This was aided by favorable timing from contracts are executed of the beginning of 2011. And also success in both the power and gas trading part of the business. As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance of $3.55 which we projected our 5% to 6% of robe top off. But it was also higher than the last guidance that we provided in the fall EEI. and I'd like to congratulate all of the employees for DTE Energy for another great year and many fronts including the things that Gerry covered but also our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 18. Gerry talked about our distinctive capability we're building Continues Improvement area is really the way we approach our work. And while we're still building this capability the company and we feel that we have many more opportunities ahead of us, we're actually getting some really nice results as you can see on the slide. Over the last 7 years, we've driven $350 million of cost savings to the bottom line and we do this because we only to our customers to keep it as low as possible. But also it's given us the flexibility to achieve our financial goals, and we do this without compromising on our ability to improve customer experience or operational metrics. 
Turning to Slide 19. Although both utilities are revenue decoupled, we watch the local economy very closely. We have said that we see economic recovery in our region and that's going to be slow with the tail on it but we're certainly seeing continued signs of positive economic health. As you know, Ford and GM and Chrysler have significantly restructured our cross profile and now they're very profitable at much lower volumes. General Motors this morning announced they earned $7.6 billion last year and many expected that they'll earn $10 billion a year going forward. All '03 U.S. automakers are profitable in U.S. sales volumes are about 13 million units, which is down from the 17 million annual sales level before the 2008 recession. On to slide on the upper left, you can see the Michigan employment is improved dramatically from a higher 14% 2 years ago to now under 10%. On the bottom left, you can see the Michigan auto production were up 67% on the drop in 2009. And on the right-hand side, you can site Edison low which is up also since 2009. Adjusted for the impacts of energy efficiency, we're expecting another 1% to 2% in 2012. On Slide 20, is our updated guidance for 2012. We're taking the midpoint of our guidance up from the early outlook that we've provided last year to $3.80 a share, which is a 7% increase over the 2011 guidance of $3.55 that we provided this time last year. 
Let me do a quick walk down the chart here. Detroit Edison guidance of $438 million to $448 million which is the same outlook we've provided at the EEI fall conference. The key drivers of the 2012 guidance to the prior year are the lower ROE from last years rate case and the favorable tax adjustment at the end of the year. And this is partially offset by the full year rate increases in 2012 in continued cost control. We might file a rate case for Edison later on this year on the fall but we're going to work hard as we always do to see if we could push that forward including all the way out into 2013. So we'll update you on our rate case strategy for Detroit Edison as we progress during the year. MichCon is $110 million to $115 million with a warrant start of the year MichCon has been negatively impacted by the $5 million in January another $3 million for February. Although MichCon does not dot the rate increase since 2009, we'll use Continues Improvement to deliver targeted earnings which we outlined here and this is about $5 million less than our fall outlook. We also plan to file a rate case for MichCon in the second quarter. SPARK Gas Storage & Pipeline targeted a modest earnings increase from existing assets after a very strong performance in 2011. 
More significant growth in this business comes in 2013 from the Bluestone pipeline that Gerry just talked about. Power & Industrial is how projected increase in earnings this year growing to $45 million to $55 million that's driven primarily by the REF business line producing at higher volumes. At Energy Trading, we're targeting an earnings at a additional level we've said I guidance characteristic $30 million to $50 million which is lower than actual earnings in 2011. And the holding company would improve year-over-year due to lower interest rates. So the total 2012 guidance is $650 million at midpoint. Slide 21 provides our cash flow guidance cash from operations is projected at $1.9 billion slightly lower than 2011 due to VBA contributions in some tax payments in 2012. Capitalist increased to $1.9 billion and I'll cover that on the next slide. We're projecting that we'll be bullish with $300 million of equity through our drip program and pension plans and we're also assuming here that we monetize our net properties for approximately our foot value of $300 million. On Slide 22 is our capital spending summary. We expect to spend $1.9 billion this year with about $1.3 billion of that you spent in disks for Edison. Operational CapEx is higher at Edison as we continue to focus on both power plant and distribution reliability. In addition, the increase in operational capital environmental spending will increase to $255 million as Gerry outlined, and also the Renewable Energy will continue to be strong. At $235 million as we continue to build out our wind portfolio. Wisconsin have higher CapEx as infrastructure related as we were pleased both cast-iron mains and we move meters out of folks homes from the inside to the outside. The Non-Utility spending will increase to $430 million again driven by the Bluestone pipeline and projects from Power & Industrial. As we spend this level of capital, we are also focused on driving economic growth in Michigan. Last year we announced with the Governor that we would increase our Michigan spend by $750 million over the next 5 years. Last year, we increased our procurement spend in Michigan by $125 million to close to $600 million and will continue to increase that Michigan spend as we fulfill our commitment to take our Michigan spend from 41% to 60% by 2016. 
On Slide 23, is an update on our balance sheet as we grow our earnings we remain focused on our balance sheet as we always have. Our leverage and cash flow metrics are within our targeted ranges. In January, the 2 utilities are updated to reflect the continues financial performance that you see there and the improvement is also has been recognizing the Michigan economy. Last year, we financed over $1 billion in debt and is going to save $25 million in interest per year and we also renew that credit facility for 5 years the total facilities it 1.8 billion dollars and we have 1 $.4 billion of that available at this time. On Slide 24, our dividend is $2.35 and is well supported since 20 team '09 we have grown our dividend by over 5% annually in line with our long-term earnings growth target. The current yield is about 4 .4% and our targeted payout ratio is 60% to 70% in future increases will be supported by or projected earnings growth. Let me wrap up on Slide 25 and then we can take your questions. We will continue to execute on our plan which is deliver and we'll deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth our way for. And we put that together more of this provide targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return utility growth is set to constructive environment. We continue to make significant investments in the utilities that we've outlined for you driven by mandated investments and also infrastructure investments. And over the next 5 years, we will invest $7.5 billion in the 2 utilities. We continue to focus on maintaining constructive regulatory environment, and we understand that something that we have to earn every day. We also have a highly engaged workforce and as Gerry outlined, they're committed to using continuous improvement tools and in both the fronts both employee engagement and Continues Improvement we're going to continue to focus our efforts as we look to improve customer service and drive efficiencies in the business. We also have substantial growth ahead of us in our Non-Utility businesses business driven by the Bluestone and REF projects. And our goal is to have our Gas Midstream in Power & Industrial businesses in a combined $225 million by 2016. And thank you for joining us, and Dana now would be happy to open up for questions."

But we do not see this happening with investments to date and our projected cost of the future investments suggests that we will be able to investing at the 10% without the production tax credits. As it makes it more expensive in our experience with the production tax, we have a small amount of wimp going into production in the state. Early on, it was $0.11 then it went to $0.06 it was due to technology evolution. The turbines went up higher, the blade profiles were changed and so we've gone from capacity factors on these turbines in the low '30s now to the low to mid '40s. And so as you may know, capacity factor is really a big impact on the -- that's for kilowatt hour delivered out of these units.

Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our ear",2721,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings for last year finished well ahead of our plan on our most recent guidance, and our cash flow and balance sheet results were strong for the year as well. 
So 2011 continued a string of solid earnings and cash flow results for the company in recent years. But our performance is about a lot more than financial results, and in fact, I believe it's only by focusing on a lot of things outside of your financial results that your earnings picture has a chance to be strong and sustainable long-term. And so I spend a lot of time with my leadership team focused on a system of interconnected priorities that I believe are the things we need to be very good at consistently in order to make our recent strong financial performance sustain long-term. There are a lot of companies who produce strong financial performance short-term or for a few years, but the trick is to make that sustain long-term and a lot of discussion here and a lot of focus on how to make that happen. And the system of priorities that we're using to do that is shown on Slide 5, and I'll start by saying I realize that Slide 5 may look like a lot of boxes and arrows to you, but it really is how we're thinking about managing DTE Energy for the long-term. So I want to take a little bit of time describing that system to you and then tell you about the progress we've made against it.
And the priority start on the left side with what I call the kind of the kingpin or key priority, which is highly engaged employees, and the bottom line is you can't have an excellent company that outperforms if your employees' focus and engagement and energy level is average. And so we really do spend a lot of time trying to build the energy engagement and focus of our people. And if you pull that off, then you have a chance at the next 3 things, which is to deliver really good service to your customers and improve that over time to use a tool that we've spent a lot of time developing here at DTE Energy continuous improvement in order to manage the quality and affordability of your products and also, to have your people drive creative growth and value creation. And if you do those 3 things well, then I think you have a shot at sustaining a constructive political and regulatory context, because if your customers are well-served, they're all voters and they shape the political arena. If you don't keep your cost in line by constantly working on affordability that eventually finds its way into the political and regulatory discussion. It's also true that if you can pursue constructive productive growth and that helps from an economic development standpoint in the state it shapes the political and regulatory context. And if you combine a good regulatory context with solid growth, then you have the formula for sustainable financial performance. 
So in terms of how we are progressing against these priorities, Slide 6 steps into that. On the employee engagement front, we use something called the Gallup survey. Thousands of U.S. companies do use that. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that our Gallup score increased. We're now on the 71st percentile of U.S. companies. So that's a good thing, although we have clear goal of wanting to take that up into the top decile or top 10%. 
We're also continuing to improve our safety performance. Another important employee outcome. Our injury rate is down 70% since the mid-2000s. We've got both of our utilities performing at top quartile level. In fact, MichCon has been at top decile level in recent years. 
Continuous improvement is something that we work every year to push deeper into the organization through education and familiarization and practice. And as a result, our O&M expense level was lower last year than in 2005. We project it'll be lower again in 2012 than it was in back in 2005. That's about $350 million on an inflation adjustment basis. But it isn't only cost, obviously. We're working to focus that CI on reliability and other important operating metrics. 
From a customer satisfaction standpoint, our MPSC complaints are down over 50% over the past 5 years. We have a target of bringing that down 10% to 15% year in, year out. 2011 also saw improvement in our J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings at both utilities. That's the fifth year in a row that we've seen that. MichCon came in first quartile. Detroit Edison wasn't that high. They were above median but not at first quartile, but they did improve. We also put a lot of work into our work on behalf of low-income customers here in the states. 
Moving on to Slide 7 on the regulatory and political front. I think when we stepped back from it, the outcome that we had in the Detroit Edison rate case late last year was constructive. The ROE did come down and we'd hope for a little higher outcome there. But when you think the case overall, I think we've got the base that's constructed the work from. And we did continue to see solid and broad political support for the regulatory structure here in the state that was put in place about 4 years ago. 
On the growth front, we saw our first major wind project at Detroit Edison. We put about $0.25 billion into that. I'll talk about that a little bit later. We also made significant progress on 2 new Non-Utility growth platforms. Our Bluestone Project related to the Marcellus and Pennsylvania, and our Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. Again, I'll talk about those 2 items a little bit later. 
And finally, on the financial front, kind of the outcome of all of the work that I just described, our earnings were $3.73, EPS was $3.73, compared to our original guidance a year ago of $3.55, so we had a nice outperform there. Did earn our ROE at Detroit Edison for the second straight year. MichCon was off slightly on its ROE, principally due to warm weather that we and everybody else saw in November and December last year. And we did increase our dividend 5% last year to $2.35 a share. 
So I feel we made good progress last year, I also feel good about our launch point for 2012 and I feel good about our longer-term growth prospects, which is where I want to turn out. 
And I will move to Slide 9 to do that. You can see on Slide 9 that we have provided guidance for 2012 to $3.80. That's $0.05 higher than the early outlook that we provided back in November. If you compare that $3.80 to the guidance that we've provided a year ago, which was $3.55, it's up 7%. In fact, if you look at the bottom of the slide, you can see that our growth in recent years has been right at about the 7% level, and we are projecting a future growth of 5% to 6%. We often get asked 5% or 6% from what pace? And we want to be clear that the 5% or 6% is from the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, so it's from that $3.80 level. 
Now let me talk for a minute about where that growth would come from, starting with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Detroit Edison will invest about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years, we project. About $4 billion of that, on the left side, will be put into base infrastructure, which is our investments to ensure the reliability of our generation fleet, our distribution systems. 2012 will be just under $800 million in that area. We also have significant expenditures continuing in environmental compliance. We can see that we've ranged that from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for the next 5 years. And the range is simply because we're still finalizing our plans and, as you know, the EPA does continue to evolve regulations, and so we may see some changes in the 5-year period that we don't fully understand now. We'll put a little over $250 million into that area in 2012. And then on Renewable Energy, we project just under $1 billion of investment to meet the RPS requirements here in Michigan. We will put $235 million into that arena in 2012. 
In fact, Slide 11 provides a bit more detail on our renewable investments because this is an area that's really emerged over the past year. You see on the left hand side of Slide 11 our first large investment in wind, and that's a 212-megawatt project that will be fully operational by March. We pursue this 50-50 with Invenergy. And all of our turbines, we have 64 of the turbines on the site, are, in fact, up and operational. We invested about $250 million into that project. The right-hand side shows you the project we are currently in the midst of. This will be 110 megawatts at 3 sites in what we call the thumb area of Michigan, and we project that'll be completed by the end of this year. And again, we'll put on the order of $250 million into that project. That one is work began on that last year and will little out of the market right now due to weather but we'll be back at it soon. And following that, we do have, in our sites, the next project, which is also 110-megawatt project on the order of $250 million of investment that would likely play out in the 2013 to early 2014 time frame in terms of completion. 
Moving on to Slide 12 for MichCon, we project that we'll invest about $1 billion over the next 5 years, but 2/3 of that in base capital focused on strengthening and expanding the distribution system, pipeline integrity and so forth, which is over $150 million into that area this year. The other 2 areas that we're working are both programmatic. One of them is main renewal, our undertaking a program to replace 670 miles of main over the next 10 years, that's about $0.5 billion investment over the 10-year period. And that's really focused primarily on cast iron main that has just reached end-of-life and needs to be replaced. 
We do plan to file for a capital recovery mechanism or a surcharge mechanism in our upcoming rate case from MichCon, and we are coordinating that carefully with the Public Service Commission. We'll spend about $40 million in this area this year. 
We also are pursuing a meter move-out program. We still have meters inside homes and our older urban areas, and we are going to be moving about 27,000 meters per year out. We need to do that. Customer services impacted too much by having this insides, so we, in the commission, have agreed it's time to get them outside, and we will invest $20 million to that end this year. 
We also have some healthy growth opportunities in our Non-Utility business, and those are the discussion that starts in Slide 13. The 2 areas where strongest growth opportunities are focused is in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business and our Power & Industrial business. Gas Storage & Pipeline is profiled on the left. It's about a $60 million business today, but we do believe it can reach $100 million by 2016. And that expansion is driven heavily by investments that are tied to the Marcellus Shale and the Millennium Pipeline and some of the things that we're working. I'll describe more of that in a minute. 
And the right-hand side is the Power & Industrial earnings profile. It's about a $50 million business this year, that's the midpoint of our guidance for 2012. We believe it can grow to about $100 million business or actually above $100 million by 2016. Most of that growth would be driven by our reduced emissions fuel business at least in the near-term. 
Slide 14 provides more color on our Gas Storage & Pipeline opportunities. In the upper left, we have talked to you previously about the Bluestone Pipeline and the associated gathering systems. Bluestone is a lateral off of our Millennium pipe. It's really focused on taking Marcellus gas to market. For us, it will total about $280 million in investment in the pipe itself and then gathering that we're going to undertake. We are heavily in the works of making that pipe real right now, permitting it right away or well along and wrapping up. This pipe is going to be built in 2 phases, a northern phase face and a southern phase. Our construction on Phase 1 will begin soon. We expect to have that in service this summer. And then Phase 2 will follow and be in service late this year. 
This activity and other developments nearby are driving expansions on the Millennium pipe described in the green -- shown on the green and in the box on the upper right. This pipe is full. It was really full at the end of last year. We saw all sorts of activity moving gas in both directions on this pipe just trying to get Marcellus production to market. We have 2 expansions of the pipe locked in. Those will result in a 50% increase in the capacity of the pipe. First expansion coming into play this year and the second next year. 
But in addition to these investments, we are working on additional future opportunities as well. The Bluestone is anchored by Southwestern Energy. But we have been approached by other producers with lease holdings that are adjacent to Bluestone, and several of those discussions we expect will continue and eventually progress into additional gas being moved on Bluestone, an additional investment for us. We also continue to work on extensions of the Millennium Pipeline, extensions and expansions, to provide greater access to the Northeast market from Marcellus production, and we are optimistic that we will make projects of that nature happen as well. 
Slide 15 provides an update on the second area of significant growth in our Non-Utility businesses. The reduced emissions fuel business within -- business line is within our Power & Industrial business. On the left-hand side of Slide 15, you see where we stood at year end 2011. We had 3 units in service at Detroit Edison plants, 2 that we have cited in other plants with utilities in the Midwest and at 4 units available for relocation inciting with other utilities. Our earnings contribution last year was under $5 million, and that's low because 3 of the units that we had an operation by end of year were only an operation for weeks. They came on line quite late in the year. And those units also add, for example, 6 months of depreciation, even though they operated for only a few weeks, so that impacted the earnings. 
If you look to this year, in the middle of the slide, our focus is on making those 5 units that we have sited and in operation operate very, very well. We're also working on relocating the remaining 4 units, and we are in discussions with a number of other utilities to that end and we expect the earnings contribution to go up to the $30 million level. 
And then looking out to 2013 and beyond, we expect to have all 9 units in operation with an average annual contribution moving forward of $50 million or so. That would be the level we'd expect in 2013 could drift up some there from -- because these tax credits do inflate over time. But that's a general feel for the level that we see right now for that business. 
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Dave Meador, who's going to give you a fuller update on our financials. Dave, over to you."
266598,146203225,258993,"DTE Energy Co., 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendi",1787,"Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Starting on the left-hand side, Detroit Edison came in higher than our Fall EEI updated guidance and earned $2.60 per share. This was driven by ongoing cost control and the partial year rate increase that we had last year, and then favorability is driven by a onetime year end tax adjustment. But second year on the row, Detroit Edison earned its authorized return on equity. 
MichCon came in at $0.65 per share. This was at the low end of the guidance and slightly below our targeted 11% return on equity levels. MichCon was on track for almost the entire year due to ongoing cost controls, but mild weather got us at the end of the year and cost a slightness there. 
In the Non-Utility group, Gas Storage & Pipelines earned $0.34 per share. This was better than guidance. It was driven by higher volumes on the pipelines in the fourth quarter. Power & Industrial finished the year in the high-end of the guidance range. This was a transition year for the group and they add several projects to deliver higher-than-expected returns and some onetime items. Energy Trading finished up strong for the year $0.31. And as you might recall, trading posted solid earnings through the third quarter and we saw that performance continue throughout the remainder of the year. This was aided by favorable timing from contracts that were executed at the beginning of 2011 and also success in both the Power & Gas Trading part of the business. 
As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance of $3.55, which we projected our 5% to 6% growth off of, but it was also higher than the last guidance that we provided at the Fall EEI, and I'd like to congratulate all of the employees at DTE Energy for another great year and many fronts, including the things that Gerry covered but also our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 18. Gerry talked about our distinctive capability we're building in the continuous improvement area and it's really the way we approach our work. And while we're still building this capability in the company and we feel that we have many more opportunities ahead of us, we're actually getting some really nice results as you can see on the slide. Over the last 7 years, we've driven $350 million of cost savings to the bottom line and we do this because we owe it to our customers to keep rates as low as possible. But also, it's given us the flexibility to achieve our financial goals, and we do this without compromising on our ability to improve customer experience or our operational metrics. 
Turning to Slide 19. Although both utilities are revenue decoupled, we watch the local economy very closely. We have said that we see economic recovery in our region and that's going to be slow with the tail on it, but we are certainly seeing continued signs of positive economic health. As you know, Ford and GM and Chrysler have significantly restructured our cross profile and now they're very profitable at much lower volumes. For example, General Motors this morning announced that they earned $7.6 billion last year, and many expected they'll earn $10 billion a year going forward. All 3 U.S. automakers are profitable and U.S. sales volumes are about 13 million units, which is down from the 17 million annual sales levels before the 2008 recession. 
On this slide on the upper left, you can see the Michigan's employment has improved dramatically from a high of 14% 2 years ago to now under 10%. On the bottom left, you can see the Michigan auto production numbers are up 67% from the trough in 2009. And on the right-hand side is Detroit Edison load which is up also since 2009. Adjusted for the impacts of energy efficiency, we're expecting load to increase another 1% to 2% in 2012. 
And Slide 20 is our updated guidance for 2012. We're taking the midpoint of our guidance up from the early outlook that we've provided last year to $3.80 a share, which is a 7% increase over the 2011 guidance of $3.55 that we provided this time last year. 
Let me do a quick walk down the chart here. Detroit Edison's guidance of $438 million to $448 million, which is the same outlook we've provided at the EEI Fall conference. The key drivers of the 2012 guidance to the prior year are the lower ROE from last year's rate case and a favorable tax adjustment at the end of the year. And this is partially offset by a full year rate increases in 2012 in continued cost control. We might file a rate case for Edison later on this year on the fall but we're going to work hard as we always do to see if we could push that forward, including all the way out into 2013. So we'll update you on our rate case strategy for Detroit Edison as we progress during the year. 
MichCon's guidance is $110 million to $115 million. With a warrant start of the year, MichCon has been negatively impacted about $5 million in January and another $3 million or so in February. Although MichCon does not had a rate increase since 2009, we'll use continuous improvement to deliver targeted earnings which we outlined here, and this is about $5 million less than our fall outlook. We also plan to file a rate case for MichCon in the second quarter. 
Gas Storage & Pipeline is targeted to have a modest earnings increase from existing assets after a very strong performance in 2011. More significant growth in this business comes in 2013 from the Bluestone Pipeline that Gerry just talked about. 
Power & Industrial is projected to have significant increase in earnings this year, growing to $45 million to $55 million. That's driven primarily by the REF business line producing at higher volumes. 
At Energy Trading, we're targeting an earnings at a traditional level, and we've set our guidance here at $30 million to $50 million, which is lower than our actual earnings in 2011. And the holding company will improve year-over-year due to lower interest rates. So the total 2012 guidance is $650 million at midpoint. 
Slide 21 provides our cash flow guidance. Cash from operations is projected at $1.9 billion, it's slightly lower than 2011 due to VEBA contributions and some tax payments in 2012. Capital has increased to $1.9 billion and I'll cover that on the next slide. 
We're projecting that we will issue $300 million of equity through our DRIP program and pension plans, and we're also assuming here that we monetize our net properties for approximately our book value of $300 million. 
On Slide 22 is our capital spending summary. We expect to spend $1.9 billion this year with about $1.3 billion of that being spent at Detroit Edison. Operational CapEx is higher at Edison as we continue to focus on both power plant and distribution reliability. In addition to the increase in operational capital, environmental spending will increase to $255 million as Gerry outlined, and also the renewable energy investments will continue to be strong at $235 million as we continue to build out our wind portfolio. 
MichCon have higher CapEx as infrastructure related as we replaced both cast iron mains and we move meters out of folks homes from the inside to the outside. The Non-Utility spending will increase to $430 million, again, driven by the Bluestone Pipeline and projects with Power & Industrial. 
As we spend this level of capital, we are also focused on driving economic growth in Michigan. Last year, we announced with the Governor that we would increase our Michigan spend by $750 million over the next 5 years. Last year, we increased our procurement spend in Michigan by $125 million to close to $600 million, and will continue to increase the Michigan spend as we fulfill our commitment to take our Michigan spend from 41% to 60% by 2016. 
The Slide 23 is an update on our balance sheet. As we grow our earnings, we'll remain focused on our balance sheet as we always have. Our leverage and cash flow metrics are within our targeted ranges. In January, the 2 utilities were upgraded by Fitch to reflect the continues financial performance that you see there, and the improvement also has been recognized in the Michigan economy. Last year, we financed over $1 billion in debt and that's going to save $25 million in interest per year. We also renewed and extended our credit facility for 5 years. Now the total facility is $1.8 billion and we have $1.4 billion of that available at this time. 
On Slide 24, our dividend is $2.35 and it's well supported. Since 2009, we have grown our dividend by over 5% annually, in line with our long-term earnings growth target. The current yield is about 4 .4% and our targeted payout ratio is 60% to 70% and future increases will be supported by our projected earnings growth. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 25 and then we can take your questions. We will continue to execute on our plan, which is deliver and we'll deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth going forward. And when you put that together with our dividend, this provides a targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return. Our Utility growth is set in a constructive environment. We continue to make significant investment in the Utilities that we've outlined for you, driven by mandated investments and also infrastructure investments. And over the next 5 years, we will invest $7.5 billion in the 2 utilities. 
We continue to focus on maintaining constructive regulatory environment and we understand that's something that we have to earn every day. We also have a highly engaged workforce. And as Gerry outlined, they are committed to using continuous improvement tools, and then both of those fronts, both employee engagement and continuous improvement, were going to continue to focus our efforts as we look to improve customer service and drive efficiencies in the business. 
We also have substantial growth ahead of us in our Non-Utility businesses, driven by the Bluestone and REF projects. And our goal is to have our Gas Midstream and Power & Industrial businesses earn a combined $225 million by 2016. 
And thank you for joining us. And Dana, now, we'd be happy to open it up for questions."

So what it really raises is what's the ultimate cause to the customers. And the most recent round of investments that we saw when you're able to internalize PTC, we have projected wind cost in the $0.0625 range. But if you lose a PTC, it takes us up a couple of cents. So you're going to be more like $0.08 to $0.085. So that's the real question, the investment will happen but PTC lower the cost of customers. And then on choice legislation, we had some discussions of that last year. It really played out late in the year with the review in the Senate Energy Committee, where they pick a broad look at the laws that were passed in 2008 and how they felt about them. And if you go and look at the findings of that committee, what they essentially said was done a full review. We like the way they're working and we're going to stand firm. And if you go into the administration with the Governor and his key aides, I think not only is their focus sales where they don't see a modification to the regulatory constructing Michigan as a priority either. So I feel good about the political climate for that."

Early on, that was about $0.11, then it went to $0.09, then it went to $0.06, and this was all due to technology evolution. The turbines went up higher, the blade profiles were changed. And so we've gone from capacity factors on these turbines that were in the low 30s now to the low to mid 40s.

Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our ear",2726,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings for last year finished well ahead of our plan on our most recent guidance, and our cash flow and balance sheet results were strong for the year as well. 
So 2011 continued a string of solid earnings and cash flow results for the company in recent years. But our performance is about a lot more than financial results, and in fact, I believe it's only by focusing on a lot of things outside of your financial results that your earnings picture has a chance to be strong and sustainable long-term. And so I spent a lot of time with my leadership team focused on a system of interconnected priorities that I believe are the things we need to be very good at consistently in order to make our recent strong financial performance sustain long-term. There are a lot of companies who produce strong financial performance short-term or for a few years, but the trick is to make that sustain long-term and a lot of discussion here and a lot of focus on how to make that happen. And the system of priorities that we're using to do that is shown on Slide 5, and I'll start by saying I realize that Slide 5 may look like a lot of boxes and arrows to you, but it really is how we're thinking about managing DTE Energy for the long-term. So I want to take a little bit of time describing that system to you and then tell you about the progress we've made against it.
And the priorities start on the left side with what I call the kind of the kingpin or key priority, which is highly engaged employees, and the bottom line is you can't have an excellent company that outperforms if your employees' focus and engagement and energy level is average. And so we really do spend a lot of time trying to build the energy engagement and focus of our people. And if you pull that off, then you have a chance at the next 3 things, which is to deliver really good service to your customers and improve that over time to use a tool that we've spent a lot of time developing here at DTE Energy, continuous improvement, in order to manage the quality and affordability of your products and also, to have your people drive creative growth and value creation. And if you do those 3 things well, then I think you have a shot at sustaining a constructive political and regulatory context, because if your customers are well-served, they're all voters and they shape the political arena. If you don't keep your cost in line by constantly working on affordability that eventually finds its way into the political and regulatory discussion. It's also true that if you can pursue constructive productive growth and that helps from an economic development standpoint in the state it shapes the political and regulatory context. And if you combine a good regulatory context with solid growth, then you have the formula for sustainable financial performance. 
So in terms of how we are progressing against these priorities, Slide 6 steps into that. On the employee engagement front, we use something called the Gallup survey. Thousands of U.S. companies do use that. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that our Gallup score increased. We're now on the 71st percentile of U.S. companies. So that's a good thing, although we have a clear goal of wanting to take that up into the top decile or top 10%. 
We're also continuing to improve our safety performance. Another important employee outcome. Our injury rate is down 70% since the mid-2000s. We've got both of our utilities performing at top quartile level. In fact, MichCon has been at top decile level in recent years. 
Continuous improvement is something that we work every year to push deeper into the organization through education and familiarization and practice. And as a result, our O&M expense level was lower last year than in 2005. We project it'll be lower again in 2012 than it was in back in 2005. That's about $350 million on an inflation adjustment basis. But it isn't only cost, obviously. We're working to focus that CI on reliability and other important operating metrics. 
From a customer satisfaction standpoint, our MPSC complaints are down over 50% over the past 5 years. We have a target of bringing that down 10% to 15% year in, year out. 2011 also saw improvement in our J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings at both utilities. That's the fifth year in a row that we've seen that. MichCon came in first quartile. Detroit Edison wasn't that high. They were above median but not at first quartile, but they did improve. We also put a lot of work into our work on behalf of low-income customers here in the states. 
Moving on to Slide 7 on the regulatory and political front. I think when we stepped back from it, the outcome that we had in the Detroit Edison rate case late last year was constructive. The ROE did come down and we'd hope for a little higher outcome there. But when you think the case overall, I think we've got a base that's constructed to work from. And we did continue to see solid and broad political support for the regulatory structure here in the state that was put in place about 4 years ago. 
On the growth front, we saw our first major wind project at Detroit Edison. We put about $0.25 billion into that. I'll talk about that a little bit later. We also made significant progress on 2 new Non-Utility growth platforms. Our Bluestone Project related to the Marcellus and Pennsylvania, and our Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. Again, I'll talk about those 2 items a little bit later. 
And finally, on the financial front, kind of the outcome of all of the work that I just described, our earnings were $3.73, EPS was $3.73, compared to our original guidance a year ago of $3.55, so we had a nice outperform there. Did earn our ROE at Detroit Edison for the second straight year. MichCon was off slightly on its ROE, principally due to warm weather that we and everybody else saw in November and December last year. And we did increase our dividend 5% last year to $2.35 a share. 
So I feel we made good progress last year, I also feel good about our launch point for 2012 and I feel good about our longer-term growth prospects, which is where I want to turn now. 
And I will move to Slide 9 to do that. You can see on Slide 9 that we have provided guidance for 2012 of $3.80. That's $0.05 higher than the early outlook that we provided back in November. If you compare that $3.80 to the guidance that we've provided a year ago, which was $3.55, it's up 7%. In fact, if you look at the bottom of the slide, you can see that our growth in recent years has been right at about the 7% level, and we are projecting a future growth of 5% to 6%. We often get asked 5% or 6% from what pace? And we want to be clear that the 5% or 6% is from the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, so it's from that $3.80 level. 
Now let me talk for a minute about where that growth would come from, starting with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Detroit Edison will invest about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years, we project. About $4 billion of that, on the left side, will be put into base infrastructure, which is our investments to ensure the reliability of our generation fleet, our distribution systems. 2012 will be just under $800 million in that area. We also have significant expenditures continuing in environmental compliance. We can see that we've ranged that from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for the next 5 years. And the range is simply because we're still finalizing our plans and, as you know, the EPA does continue to evolve regulations, and so we may see some changes in the 5-year period that we don't fully understand now. We'll put a little over $250 million into that area in 2012. And then on Renewable Energy, we project just under $1 billion of investment to meet the RPS requirements here in Michigan. We will put $235 million into that arena in 2012. 
In fact, Slide 11 provides a bit more detail on our renewable investments because this is an area that's really emerged over the past year. You see on the left hand side of Slide 11, our first large investment in wind, and that's a 212-megawatt project that will be fully operational by March. We pursue this 50-50 with Invenergy. And all of our turbines, we have 64 of the turbines on the site, are, in fact, up and operational. We invested about $250 million into that project. The right-hand side shows you the project we are currently in the midst of. This will be 110 megawatts at 3 sites in what we call the thumb area of Michigan, and we project that will be completed by the end of this year. And again, we'll put on the order of $250 million into that project. That one is -- work began on that last year and will -- little out of the market right now due to weather but we'll be back at it soon. And following that, we do have, in our sites, the next project, which is also 110-megawatt project on the order of $250 million of investment that would likely play out in the 2013 to early 2014 time frame in terms of completion. 
Moving on to Slide 12 for MichCon, we project that we'll invest about $1 billion over the next 5 years, but 2/3 of that in base capital focused on strengthening and expanding the distribution system, pipeline integrity and so forth, which just over $150 million into that area this year. The other 2 areas that we're working are both programmatic. One of them is main renewal, our undertaking a program to replace 670 miles of main over the next 10 years, that's about $0.5 billion investment over the 10-year period. And that's really focused primarily on cast iron main that has just reached end-of-life and needs to be replaced. 
We do plan to file for a capital recovery mechanism or a surcharge mechanism in our upcoming rate case from MichCon, and we are coordinating that carefully with the Public Service Commission. We'll spend about $40 million in this area this year. 
We also are pursuing a meter move-out program. We still have meters inside homes and our older urban areas, and we are going to be moving about 27,000 meters per year out. We need to do that. Customer services impacted too much by having these inside, so we, in the commission, have agreed it's time to get them outside, and we will invest $20 million to that end this year. 
We also have some healthy growth opportunities in our Non-Utility business, and those are -- the discussion that starts in Slide 13. The 2 areas where strongest growth opportunities are focused is in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business and our Power & Industrial business. Gas Storage & Pipeline is profiled on the left. It's about a $60 million business today, but we do believe it can reach $100 million by 2016. And that expansion is driven heavily by investments that are tied to the Marcellus Shale and the Millennium Pipeline and some of the things that we're working. I'll describe more of that in a minute. 
And the right-hand side is the Power & Industrial earnings profile. It's about a $50 million business this year, that's the midpoint of our guidance for 2012. We believe it can grow to about $100 million business or actually above $100 million by 2016. Most of that growth would be driven by our reduced emissions fuel business at least in the near-term. 
Slide 14 provides more color on our Gas Storage & Pipeline opportunities. In the upper left, we have talked to you previously about the Bluestone Pipeline and the associated gathering systems. Bluestone is a lateral off of our Millennium pipe. It's really focused on taking Marcellus gas to market. For us, it will total about $280 million in investment in the pipe itself and then gathering that we're going to undertake. We are heavily in the works of making that pipe real right now, permitting it right away or well along and wrapping up. This pipe is going to be built in 2 phases, a northern phase phase and a southern phase. Our construction on Phase 1 will begin soon. We expect to have that in service this summer. And then Phase 2 will follow and be in service late this year. 
This activity and other developments nearby are driving expansions on the Millennium pipe described in the green -- shown on the green and in the box on the upper right. This pipe is full. It was really full at the end of last year. We saw all sorts of activity moving gas in both directions on this pipe just trying to get Marcellus production to market. We have 2 expansions of the pipe locked in. Those will result in a 50% increase in the capacity of the pipe. First expansion coming into play this year and the second next year. 
But in addition to these investments, we are working on additional future opportunities as well. The Bluestone is anchored by Southwestern Energy. But we have been approached by other producers with lease holdings that are adjacent to Bluestone, and several of those discussions we expect will continue and eventually progress into additional gas being moved on Bluestone, an additional investment for us. We also continue to work on extensions of the Millennium Pipeline, extensions and expansions, to provide greater access to the Northeast market from Marcellus production, and we are optimistic that we will make projects of that nature happen as well. 
Slide 15 provides an update on the second area of significant growth in our Non-Utility businesses. The reduced emissions fuel business within -- business line is within our Power & Industrial business. On the left-hand side of Slide 15, you see where we stood at year end 2011. We had 3 units in service at Detroit Edison plants, 2 that we have cited in other plants with utilities in the Midwest and at 4 units available for relocation inciting with other utilities. Our earnings contribution last year was under $5 million, and that's low because 3 of the units that we had an operation by end of year were only in operation for weeks. They came on line quite late in the year. And those units also had, for example, 6 months of depreciation, even though they operated for only a few weeks, so that impacted the earnings. 
If you look to this year, in the middle of the slide, our focus is on making those 5 units that we have sited and in operation operate very, very well. We're also working on relocating the remaining 4 units, and we are in discussions with a number of other utilities to that end and we expect the earnings contribution to go up to the $30 million level. 
And then looking out to 2013 and beyond, we expect to have all 9 units in operation with an average annual contribution moving forward of $50 million or so. That would be the level we'd expect in 2013 could drift up some there from -- because these tax credits do inflate over time. But that's a general feel for the level that we see right now for that business. 
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Dave Meador, who's going to give you a fuller update on our financials. Dave, over to you."
266598,146203225,259109,"DTE Energy Co., 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendi",1791,"Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Starting on the left-hand side, Detroit Edison came in higher than our Fall EEI updated guidance and earned $2.60 per share. This was driven by ongoing cost control and the partial year rate increase that we had last year, and then favorability is driven by a onetime year end tax adjustment. But second year on the row, Detroit Edison earned its authorized return on equity. 
MichCon came in at $0.65 per share. This is at the low end of the guidance and slightly below our targeted 11% return on equity levels. MichCon was on track for almost the entire year due to ongoing cost controls, but mild weather got us at the end of the year and caused a slight miss there. 
In the Non-Utility group, Gas Storage & Pipelines earned $0.34 per share. This was better than guidance. It was driven by higher volumes on the pipelines in the fourth quarter. Power & Industrial finished the year in the high-end of the guidance range. This was a transition year for the group and they add several projects to deliver higher-than-expected returns and some onetime items. Energy Trading finished up strong for the year at $0.31. And as you might recall, trading posted solid earnings through the third quarter and we saw that performance continue throughout the remainder of the year. This was aided by favorable timing from contracts that were executed at the beginning of 2011 and also success in both the Power & Gas Trading part of the business. 
As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance of $3.55, which we projected our 5% to 6% growth off of, but it was also higher than the last guidance that we provided at the Fall EEI, and I'd like to congratulate all of the employees at DTE Energy for another great year on many fronts, including the things that Gerry covered but also our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 18. Gerry talked about our distinctive capability we're building in the continuous improvement area and it's really the way we approach our work. And while we're still building this capability in the company and we feel that we have many more opportunities ahead of us, we're actually getting some really nice results as you can see on this slide. Over the last 7 years, we've driven $350 million of cost savings to the bottom line and we do this because we owe it to our customers to keep rates as low as possible. But also, it's given us the flexibility to achieve our financial goals, and we do this without compromising on our ability to improve customer experience or our operational metrics. 
Turning to Slide 19. Although both utilities are revenue decoupled, we watched the local economy very closely. We have said that we see economic recovery in our region and that's going to be slow with the tail on it, but we are certainly seeing continued signs of positive economic health. As you know, Ford and GM and Chrysler have significantly restructured their cost profile and now they're very profitable at much lower volumes. For example, General Motors this morning announced that they earned $7.6 billion last year, and many expected that they'll earn $10 billion a year going forward. All 3 U.S. automakers are profitable and U.S. sales volumes are at about 13 million units, which is down from the 17 million annual sales levels before the 2008 recession. 
On this slide on the upper left, you can see that Michigan's employment has improved dramatically from a high of 14% 2 years ago to now under 10%. On the bottom left, you can see the Michigan auto production numbers are up 67% from the trough in 2009. And on the right-hand side is Detroit Edison LOAD which is up also since 2009. Adjusted for the impacts of energy efficiency, we're expecting LOAD to increase another 1% to 2% in 2012. 
And Slide 20 is our updated guidance for 2012. We're taking the midpoint of our guidance up from the early outlook that we've provided last year to $3.80 a share, which is a 7% increase over the 2011 guidance of $3.55 that we provided this time last year. 
Let me do a quick walk down the chart here. Detroit Edison's guidance of $438 million to $448 million, which is the same outlook we've provided at the EEI Fall conference. The key drivers of the 2012 guidance to the prior year are the lower ROE from last year's rate case and a favorable tax adjustment at the end of the year. And this is partially offset by a full year of rate increases in 2012 in continued cost control. We might file a rate case for Edison later on this year in the fall but we're going to work hard as we always do to see if we could push that forward, including all the way out into 2013. So we'll update you on our rate case strategy for Detroit Edison as we progress during the year. 
MichCon's guidance is $110 million to $115 million. With a warm start of the year, MichCon has been negatively impacted about $5 million in January and another $3 million or so in February. Although MichCon does not had a rate increase since 2009, we'll use continuous improvement to deliver targeted earnings which we outlined here, and this is about $5 million less than our fall outlook. We also plan to file a rate case for MichCon in the second quarter. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines is targeted to have a modest earnings increase from existing assets after a very strong performance in 2011. More significant growth in this business comes in 2013 from the Bluestone Pipeline that Gerry just talked about. 
Power & Industrial is projected to have significant increase in earnings this year, growing to $45 million to $55 million. That's driven primarily by the REF business line producing at higher volumes. 
At Energy Trading, we're targeting an earnings at a traditional level, and we've set our guidance here at $30 million to $50 million, which is lower than our actual earnings in 2011. And the holding company will improve year-over-year due to lower interest rates. So the total 2012 guidance is $650 million at midpoint. 
Slide 21 provides our cash flow guidance. Cash from operations is projected at $1.9 billion, it's slightly lower than 2011 due to VEBA contributions and some tax payments in 2012. Capital has increased to $1.9 billion and I'll cover that on the next slide. 
We're projecting that we will issue $300 million of equity through our DRIP program and pension plans, and we're also assuming here that we monetize our net properties for approximately our book value of $300 million. 
On Slide 22 is our capital spending summary. We expect to spend $1.9 billion this year with about $1.3 billion of that being spent at Detroit Edison. Operational CapEx is higher at Edison as we continue to focus on both power plant and distribution reliability. In addition to the increase in operational capital, environmental spending will increase to $255 million as Gerry outlined, and also the renewable energy investments will continue to be strong at $235 million as we continue to build out our wind portfolio. 
MichCon have higher CapEx as infrastructure related as we replaced both cast iron mains and we move meters out of folks homes from the inside to the outside. The Non-Utility spending will increase to $430 million, again, driven by the Bluestone Pipeline and projects with Power & Industrial. 
As we spend this level of capital, we are also focused on driving economic growth in Michigan. Last year, we announced with the Governor that we would increase our Michigan spend by $750 million over the next 5 years. Last year, we increased our procurement spend in Michigan by $125 million to close to $600 million, and will continue to increase the Michigan spend as we fulfill our commitment to take our Michigan spend from 41% to 60% by 2016. 
The Slide 23 is an update on our balance sheet. As we grow our earnings, we'll remain focused on our balance sheet as we always have. Our leverage and cash flow metrics are within our targeted ranges. In January, the 2 utilities were upgraded by Fitch to reflect the continued financial performance that you see there, and the improvement also has been recognized in the Michigan economy. Last year, we financed over $1 billion in debt and that's going to save $25 million in interest per year. We also renewed and extended our credit facility for 5 years. Now the total facility is $1.8 billion and we have $1.4 billion of that available at this time. 
On Slide 24, our dividend is $2.35 and it's well supported. Since 2009, we have grown our dividend by over 5% annually, in line with our long-term earnings growth target. The current yield is about 4.4% and our targeted payout ratio is 60% to 70% and future increases will be supported by our projected earnings growth. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 25 and then we can take your questions. We will continue to execute on our plan, which has delivered and will deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth going forward. And when you put that together with our dividend, this provides a targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return. Our Utility growth is set in a constructive environment. We continue to make significant investment in the Utilities that we've outlined for you, driven by mandated investments and also infrastructure investments. And over the next 5 years, we will invest $7.5 billion in the 2 utilities. 
We continue to focus on maintaining constructive regulatory environment and we understand that's something that we have to earn every day. We also have a highly engaged workforce. And as Gerry outlined, they are committed to using continuous improvement tools, and on both of those fronts, both employee engagement and continuous improvement, we're going to continue to focus our efforts as we look to improve customer service and drive efficiencies in the business. 
We also have substantial growth ahead of us in our Non-Utility businesses, driven by the Bluestone and REF projects. And our goal is to have our Gas Midstream and Power & Industrial businesses earn a combined $225 million by 2016. 
And thank you for joining us. And Dana, now, we'd be happy to open it up for questions."

But we do not see that happening with the investments to date and our projected cost of future investments suggest we will be able to invest -- to hit the 10% without the production tax credits. Actually it makes it more expensive. But our experience with the production tax credits, we had a small amount of wind going into production in the state. Early on, that was about $0.11, then it went to $0.09, then it went to $0.06, and this was all due to technology evolution. The turbines went up higher, the blade profiles were changed. And so we've gone from capacity factors on these turbines that were in the low 30s now to the low to mid 40s. And so -- and that, as you may know, capacity factor is a really big impact on the -- that's for kilowatt hour delivered out of these units.

Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our ear",2725,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings for last year finished well ahead of our plan on our most recent guidance, and our cash flow and balance sheet results were strong for the year as well. 
So 2011 continued a string of solid earnings and cash flow results for the company in recent years. But our performance is about a lot more than financial results, and in fact, I believe it's only by focusing on a lot of things outside of your financial results that your earnings picture has a chance to be strong and sustainable long-term. And so I spent a lot of time with my leadership team focused on a system of interconnected priorities that I believe are the things we need to be very good at consistently in order to make our recent strong financial performance sustain long-term. There are a lot of companies who produce strong financial performance short-term or for a few years, but the trick is to make that sustain long-term and a lot of discussion here and a lot of focus on how to make that happen. And the system of priorities that we're using to do that is shown on Slide 5, and I'll start by saying I realize that Slide 5 may look like a lot of boxes and arrows to you, but it really is how we're thinking about managing DTE Energy for the long-term. So I want to take a little bit of time describing that system to you and then tell you about the progress we've made against it.
And the priorities start on the left side with what I call the kind of the kingpin or key priority, which is highly engaged employees, and the bottom line is you can't have an excellent company that outperforms if your employees' focus and engagement and energy level is average. And so we really do spend a lot of time trying to build the energy engagement and focus of our people. And if you pull that off, then you have a chance at the next 3 things, which is to deliver really good service to your customers and improve that over time to use a tool that we've spent a lot of time developing here at DTE Energy, continuous improvement, in order to manage the quality and affordability of your products and also, to have your people drive creative growth and value creation. And if you do those 3 things well, then I think you have a shot at sustaining a constructive political and regulatory context, because if your customers are well-served, they're all voters and they shape the political arena. If you don't keep your cost in line by constantly working on affordability that eventually finds its way into the political and regulatory discussion. It's also true that if you can pursue constructive productive growth and that helps from an economic development standpoint in the state it shapes the political and regulatory context. And if you combine a good regulatory context with solid growth, then you have the formula for sustainable financial performance. 
So in terms of how we are progressing against these priorities, Slide 6 steps into that. On the employee engagement front, we use something called the Gallup survey. Thousands of U.S. companies do use that. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that our Gallup score increased. We're now on the 71st percentile of U.S. companies. So that's a good thing, although we have a clear goal of wanting to take that up into the top decile or top 10%. 
We're also continuing to improve our safety performance. Another important employee outcome. Our injury rate is down 70% since the mid-2000s. We've got both of our utilities performing at top quartile level. In fact, MichCon has been at top decile level in recent years. 
Continuous improvement is something that we work every year to push deeper into the organization through education and familiarization and practice. And as a result, our O&M expense level was lower last year than in 2005. We project it'll be lower again in 2012 than it was in back in 2005. That's about $350 million on an inflation adjustment basis. But it isn't only cost, obviously. We're working to focus that CI on reliability and other important operating metrics. 
From a customer satisfaction standpoint, our MPSC complaints are down over 50% over the past 5 years. We have a target of bringing that down 10% to 15% year in, year out. 2011 also saw improvement in our J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings at both utilities. That's the fifth year in a row that we've seen that. MichCon came in first quartile. Detroit Edison wasn't that high. They were above median but not at first quartile, but they did improve. We also put a lot of work into our work on behalf of low-income customers here in the states. 
Moving on to Slide 7 on the regulatory and political front. I think when we stepped back from it, the outcome that we had in the Detroit Edison rate case late last year was constructive. The ROE did come down and we'd hope for a little higher outcome there. But when you think the case overall, I think we've got a base that's constructed to work from. And we did continue to see solid and broad political support for the regulatory structure here in the state that was put in place about 4 years ago. 
On the growth front, we saw our first major wind project at Detroit Edison. We put about $0.25 billion into that. I'll talk about that a little bit later. We also made significant progress on 2 new Non-Utility growth platforms. Our Bluestone Project related to the Marcellus and Pennsylvania, and our Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. Again, I'll talk about those 2 items a little bit later. 
And finally, on the financial front, kind of the outcome of all of the work that I just described, our earnings were $3.73, EPS was $3.73, compared to our original guidance a year ago of $3.55, so we had a nice outperform there. Did earn our ROE at Detroit Edison for the second straight year. MichCon was off slightly on its ROE, principally due to warm weather that we and everybody else saw in November and December last year. And we did increase our dividend 5% last year to $2.35 a share. 
So I feel we made good progress last year, I also feel good about our launch point for 2012 and I feel good about our longer-term growth prospects, which is where I want to turn now. 
And I will move to Slide 9 to do that. You can see on Slide 9 that we have provided guidance for 2012 of $3.80. That's $0.05 higher than the early outlook that we provided back in November. If you compare that $3.80 to the guidance that we've provided a year ago, which was $3.55, it's up 7%. In fact, if you look at the bottom of the slide, you can see that our growth in recent years has been right at about the 7% level, and we are projecting a future growth of 5% to 6%. We often get asked 5% or 6% from what pace? And we want to be clear that the 5% or 6% is from the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, so it's from that $3.80 level. 
Now let me talk for a minute about where that growth would come from, starting with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Detroit Edison will invest about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years, we project. About $4 billion of that, on the left side, will be put into base infrastructure, which is our investments to ensure the reliability of our generation fleet, our distribution systems. 2012 will be just under $800 million in that area. We also have significant expenditures continuing in environmental compliance. We can see that we've ranged that from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for the next 5 years. And the range is simply because we're still finalizing our plans and, as you know, the EPA does continue to evolve regulations, and so we may see some changes in the 5-year period that we don't fully understand now. We'll put a little over $250 million into that area in 2012. And then on Renewable Energy, we project just under $1 billion of investment to meet the RPS requirements here in Michigan. We will put $235 million into that arena in 2012. 
In fact, Slide 11 provides a bit more detail on our renewable investments because this is an area that's really emerged over the past year. You see on the left hand side of Slide 11, our first large investment in wind, and that's a 212-megawatt project that will be fully operational by March. We pursue this 50-50 with Invenergy. And all of our turbines, we have 64 of the turbines on the site, are, in fact, up and operational. We invested about $250 million into that project. The right-hand side shows you the project we are currently in the midst of. This will be 110 megawatts at 3 sites in what we call the thumb area of Michigan, and we project that will be completed by the end of this year. And again, we'll put on the order of $250 million into that project. That one is -- work began on that last year and will -- little out of the market right now due to weather but we'll be back at it soon. And following that, we do have, in our sites, the next project, which is also 110-megawatt project on the order of $250 million of investment that would likely play out in the 2013 to early 2014 time frame in terms of completion. 
Moving on to Slide 12 for MichCon, we project that we'll invest about $1 billion over the next 5 years, but 2/3 of that in base capital focused on strengthening and expanding the distribution system, pipeline integrity and so forth, which just over $150 million into that area this year. The other 2 areas that we're working are both programmatic. One of them is main renewal, our undertaking a program to replace 670 miles of main over the next 10 years, that's about $0.5 billion investment over the 10-year period. And that's really focused primarily on cast iron main that has just reached end-of-life and needs to be replaced. 
We do plan to file for a capital recovery mechanism or a surcharge mechanism in our upcoming rate case from MichCon, and we are coordinating that carefully with the Public Service Commission. We'll spend about $40 million in this area this year. 
We also are pursuing a meter move-out program. We still have meters inside homes and our older urban areas, and we are going to be moving about 27,000 meters per year out. We need to do that. Customer services impacted too much by having these inside, so we, in the commission, have agreed it's time to get them outside, and we will invest $20 million to that end this year. 
We also have some healthy growth opportunities in our Non-Utility business, and those are -- the discussion that starts in Slide 13. The 2 areas where strongest growth opportunities are focused is in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business and our Power & Industrial business. Gas Storage & Pipeline is profiled on the left. It's about a $60 million business today, but we do believe it can reach $100 million by 2016. And that expansion is driven heavily by investments that are tied to the Marcellus Shale and the Millennium Pipeline and some of the things that we're working. I'll describe more of that in a minute. 
And the right-hand side is the Power & Industrial earnings profile. It's about a $50 million business this year, that's the midpoint of our guidance for 2012. We believe it can grow to about $100 million business or actually above $100 million by 2016. Most of that growth would be driven by our reduced emissions fuel business at least in the near-term. 
Slide 14 provides more color on our Gas Storage & Pipeline opportunities. In the upper left, we have talked to you previously about the Bluestone Pipeline and the associated gathering systems. Bluestone is a lateral off of our Millennium pipe. It's really focused on taking Marcellus gas to market. For us, it will total about $280 million in investment in the pipe itself and then gathering that we're going to undertake. We are heavily in the works of making that pipe real right now, permitting it right away or well along and wrapping up. This pipe is going to be built in 2 phases, a northern phase and a southern phase. Our construction on Phase 1 will begin soon. We expect to have that in service this summer. And then Phase 2 will follow and be in service late this year. 
This activity and other developments nearby are driving expansions on the Millennium pipe described in the green -- shown on the green and in the box on the upper right. This pipe is full. It was really full at the end of last year. We saw all sorts of activity moving gas in both directions on this pipe just trying to get Marcellus production to market. We have 2 expansions of the pipe locked in. Those will result in a 50% increase in the capacity of the pipe. First expansion coming into play this year and the second next year. 
But in addition to these investments, we are working on additional future opportunities as well. The Bluestone is anchored by Southwestern Energy. But we have been approached by other producers with lease holdings that are adjacent to Bluestone, and several of those discussions we expect will continue and eventually progress into additional gas being moved on Bluestone, an additional investment for us. We also continue to work on extensions of the Millennium Pipeline, extensions and expansions, to provide greater access to the Northeast market from Marcellus production, and we are optimistic that we will make projects of that nature happen as well. 
Slide 15 provides an update on the second area of significant growth in our Non-Utility businesses. The reduced emissions fuel business within -- business line is within our Power & Industrial business. On the left-hand side of Slide 15, you see where we stood at year end 2011. We had 3 units in service at Detroit Edison plants, 2 that we have cited in other plants with utilities in the Midwest and at 4 units available for relocation inciting with other utilities. Our earnings contribution last year was under $5 million, and that's low because 3 of the units that we had an operation by end of year were only in operation for weeks. They came on line quite late in the year. And those units also had, for example, 6 months of depreciation, even though they operated for only a few weeks, so that impacted the earnings. 
If you look to this year, in the middle of the slide, our focus is on making those 5 units that we have sited and in operation operate very, very well. We're also working on relocating the remaining 4 units, and we are in discussions with a number of other utilities to that end and we expect the earnings contribution to go up to the $30 million level. 
And then looking out to 2013 and beyond, we expect to have all 9 units in operation with an average annual contribution moving forward of $50 million or so. That would be the level we'd expect in 2013 could drift up some there from -- because these tax credits do inflate over time. But that's a general feel for the level that we see right now for that business. 
And with that, I am going to turn things over to Dave Meador, who's going to give you a fuller update on our financials. Dave, over to you."

I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendi",1790,"Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Starting on the left-hand side, Detroit Edison came in higher than our Fall EEI updated guidance and earned $2.60 per share. This was driven by ongoing cost control and the partial year rate increase that we had last year, and then favorability is driven by a onetime year-end tax adjustment. But second year on the row, Detroit Edison earned its authorized return on equity. 
MichCon came in at $0.65 per share. This is at the low end of the guidance and slightly below our targeted 11% return on equity levels. MichCon was on track for almost the entire year due to ongoing cost controls, but mild weather got us at the end of the year and caused a slight miss there. 
In the Non-Utility group, Gas Storage & Pipelines earned $0.34 per share. This was better than guidance. It was driven by higher volumes on the pipelines in the fourth quarter. Power & Industrial finished the year in the high-end of the guidance range. This was a transition year for the group and they add several projects to deliver higher-than-expected returns and some onetime items. Energy Trading finished up strong for the year at $0.31. And as you might recall, trading posted solid earnings through the third quarter and we saw that performance continue throughout the remainder of the year. This was aided by favorable timing from contracts that were executed at the beginning of 2011 and also success in both the Power & Gas Trading part of the business. 
As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance of $3.55, which we projected our 5% to 6% growth off of, but it was also higher than the last guidance that we provided at the Fall EEI, and I'd like to congratulate all of the employees at DTE Energy for another great year on many fronts, including the things that Gerry covered but also our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 18. Gerry talked about our distinctive capability we're building in the continuous improvement area and it's really the way we approach our work. And while we're still building this capability in the company and we feel that we have many more opportunities ahead of us, we're actually getting some really nice results as you can see on this slide. Over the last 7 years, we've driven $350 million of cost savings to the bottom line and we do this because we owe it to our customers to keep rates as low as possible. But also, it's given us the flexibility to achieve our financial goals, and we do this without compromising on our ability to improve customer experience or our operational metrics. 
Turning to Slide 19. Although both utilities are revenue decoupled, we watched the local economy very closely. We have said that we see economic recovery in our region and that's going to be slow with the tail on it, but we are certainly seeing continued signs of positive economic health. As you know, Ford and GM and Chrysler have significantly restructured their cost profile and now they're very profitable at much lower volumes. For example, General Motors this morning announced that they earned $7.6 billion last year, and many expected that they'll earn $10 billion a year going forward. All 3 U.S. automakers are profitable and U.S. sales volumes are at about 13 million units, which is down from the 17 million annual sales levels before the 2008 recession. 
On this slide on the upper left, you can see that Michigan's employment has improved dramatically from a high of 14% 2 years ago to now under 10%. On the bottom left, you can see the Michigan auto production numbers are up 67% from the trough in 2009. And on the right-hand side is Detroit Edison LOAD which is up also since 2009. Adjusted for the impacts of energy efficiency, we're expecting LOAD to increase another 1% to 2% in 2012. 
And Slide 20 is our updated guidance for 2012. We're taking the midpoint of our guidance up from the early outlook that we've provided last year to $3.80 a share, which is a 7% increase over the 2011 guidance of $3.55 that we provided this time last year. 
Let me do a quick walk down the chart here. Detroit Edison's guidance of $438 million to $448 million, which is the same outlook we've provided at the EEI Fall conference. The key drivers of the 2012 guidance to the prior year are the lower ROE from last year's rate case and a favorable tax adjustment at the end of the year. And this is partially offset by a full year of rate increases in 2012 in continued cost control. We might file a rate case for Edison later on this year in the fall but we're going to work hard as we always do to see if we could push that forward, including all the way out into 2013. So we'll update you on our rate case strategy for Detroit Edison as we progress during the year. 
MichCon's guidance is $110 million to $115 million. With a warm start of the year, MichCon has been negatively impacted about $5 million in January and another $3 million or so in February. Although MichCon does not had a rate increase since 2009, we'll use continuous improvement to deliver targeted earnings which we outlined here, and this is about $5 million less than our fall outlook. We also plan to file a rate case for MichCon in the second quarter. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines is targeted to have a modest earnings increase from existing assets after a very strong performance in 2011. More significant growth in this business comes in 2013 from the Bluestone Pipeline that Gerry just talked about. 
Power & Industrial is projected to have significant increase in earnings this year, growing to $45 million to $55 million. That's driven primarily by the REF business line producing at higher volumes. 
At Energy Trading, we're targeting an earnings at a traditional level, and we've set our guidance here at $30 million to $50 million, which is lower than our actual earnings in 2011. And the holding company will improve year-over-year due to lower interest rates. So the total 2012 guidance is $650 million at midpoint. 
Slide 21 provides our cash flow guidance. Cash from operations is projected at $1.9 billion, it's slightly lower than 2011 due to VEBA contributions and some tax payments in 2012. Capital has increased to $1.9 billion and I'll cover that on the next slide. 
We're projecting that we will issue $300 million of equity through our DRIP program and pension plans, and we're also assuming here that we monetize our net properties for approximately our book value of $300 million. 
On Slide 22 is our capital spending summary. We expect to spend $1.9 billion this year with about $1.3 billion of that being spent at Detroit Edison. Operational CapEx is higher at Edison as we continue to focus on both power plant and distribution reliability. In addition to the increase in operational capital, environmental spending will increase to $255 million as Gerry outlined, and also the renewable energy investments will continue to be strong at $235 million as we continue to build out our wind portfolio. 
MichCon have higher CapEx as infrastructure related as we replaced both cast iron mains and we move meters out of folks homes from the inside to the outside. The Non-Utility spending will increase to $430 million, again, driven by the Bluestone Pipeline and projects with Power & Industrial. 
As we spend this level of capital, we are also focused on driving economic growth in Michigan. Last year, we announced with the Governor that we would increase our Michigan spend by $750 million over the next 5 years. Last year, we increased our procurement spend in Michigan by $125 million to close to $600 million, and will continue to increase the Michigan spend as we fulfill our commitment to take our Michigan spend from 41% to 60% by 2016. 
The Slide 23 is an update on our balance sheet. As we grow our earnings, we'll remain focused on our balance sheet as we always have. Our leverage and cash flow metrics are within our targeted ranges. In January, the 2 utilities were upgraded by Fitch to reflect the continued financial performance that you see there, and the improvement also has been recognized in the Michigan economy. Last year, we financed over $1 billion in debt and that's going to save $25 million in interest per year. We also renewed and extended our credit facility for 5 years. Now the total facility is $1.8 billion and we have $1.4 billion of that available at this time. 
On Slide 24, our dividend is $2.35 and it's well supported. Since 2009, we have grown our dividend by over 5% annually, in line with our long-term earnings growth target. The current yield is about 4.4% and our targeted payout ratio is 60% to 70% and future increases will be supported by our projected earnings growth. 
Let me wrap up on Slide 25 and then we can take your questions. We will continue to execute on our plan, which has delivered and will deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth going forward. And when you put that together with our dividend, this provides a targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return. Our Utility growth is set in a constructive environment. We continue to make significant investment in the Utilities that we've outlined for you, driven by mandated investments and also infrastructure investments. And over the next 5 years, we will invest $7.5 billion in the 2 utilities. 
We continue to focus on maintaining constructive regulatory environment and we understand that's something that we have to earn every day. We also have a highly engaged workforce. And as Gerry outlined, they are committed to using continuous improvement tools, and on both of those fronts, both employee engagement and continuous improvement, we're going to continue to focus our efforts as we look to improve customer service and drive efficiencies in the business. 
We also have substantial growth ahead of us in our Non-Utility businesses, driven by the Bluestone and REF projects. And our goal is to have our Gas Midstream and Power & Industrial businesses earn a combined $225 million by 2016. 
And thank you for joining us. And Dana, now, we'd be happy to open it up for questions."

Actually it makes it more expensive. But our experience with the production tax credits, we had a small amount of wind going into production in the state. Early on, that was about $0.11, then it went to $0.09, then it went to $0.06, and this was all due to technology evolution. The turbines went up higher, the blade profiles were changed. And so we've gone from capacity factors on these turbines that were in the low 30s now to the low to mid 40s. And so -- and that, as you may know, capacity factor is a really big impact on the -- that's for kilowatt hour delivered out of these units.

With me this mourning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have the members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
If you turn to Page 4, this morning we're going to cover our first quarter results and we'll also discuss the recently filed case at MichCon. We'll be at the AGA financial forum on May 7 and 8 and we'll take that opportunity to update you on some of our growth projects of the 2 utilities, as well as the Gas Storage & Pipeline's Bluestone Project in the Power & Industrial Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. 
We're expecting high today of about 55 degrees here in Detroit, actually it's a sunny day which is consistent with what you would expect here in Michigan in April. And this is a sharp to the first quarter where we experienced anything but seasonal weather. And similar to many other parts of the country, the MichCon service territory saw one of the warmest winters on record. The mild temperatures were great news for our customers and form of lower utility bills. As you've seen in our recent press release, the warm weather had an impact on the first quarter. It did include about $8 million of that weather from January and early February when we provided the guidance. 
So with that said, let me start on Page 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share. And when you combine that with our attractive dividend, it provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. All of these is set around one of our Northstar and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. Both of the utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison as we played out for you, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by investments including a long-term replacement plan and a program to move gas meters out of customer homes. The importance of these infrastructure investments is evident in the rate case that we failed filed last Friday at MichCon. We have a very constructive energy legislation framework in Michigan and also a regulatory structure. We see a desire and responsibility to earn that favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement, capabilities in everything we do to ensure that our utilities are controlling costs and minimizing rate increases to our customers and also ensuring great customer experiences. Many of you have heard us talk about our intense focus that we have on continuous improvement. This is something we've been working on for many years, and I'll talk more about that when I talk about how we're going to offset whether this year. But it's something we take great pride in as we look at the challenges of the quarter, we're going to use this continuous improvement program as a lever to help pull us in line with what our goals for the entire year. 
We continue to see a track of growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses both at the power industrial projects and Gas Storage & Pipelines. And as we mentioned, we'll give you a more detailed update on that at AGA in just over a week. 
Page 6 is an overview of the quarter. Now, the face of the unusually warm weather, DTE Energy had operating earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.11 on the first quarter of last year. Detroit Edison's earnings were flat year-over-year. While MichCon's earnings were down significantly due to the weather. Earnings at Energy Trading were down a little from last year and we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 and we're targeting the midpoint of $3.80. We'll leverage our cost and revenue opportunities across the portfolio businessess toss at the first quarter weather. And as we've indicated, as a priority for us and our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We generated over $600 million of cash from operations from the first quarter and Nick will talk about that a little bit later in the call. 
Turning to Page 7 with the first quarter behind us, I'd like to take a few minutes to take you through how I""m thinking about our full year 2012 guidance. With a final order in the Detroit Edison rate case last fall, we are expecting earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year. And this is consistent with our original guidance that we provided you. As you know, the summer cooling months since activities, our drivers of results at Detroit Edison, much of that still lies ahead of us. Assuming normal weather, I'm confident that Detroit Edison will hit its target and actually might get slightly above midpoint. The biggest part of 2012 heating season behind us, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach its guidance range for the year. But with continuous improvement and potential one time cost actions, the bottom end of the range is achievable. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines continue to provide solid earnings streams. Additionally, we're looking at some revenue opportunities here in this business to help offset the challenges at MichCon. Year-over-year, we're expecting reduced emission fuels or REF, as we call it, to deliver nice bump in operating earnings power and industrial projects. We're also looking at revenue enhancement opportunities in this business to offset the first quarter weather and other business units. So, for GSP in the Power & Industrial group, we're looking to drive both of those to the high-end of their guidance range. As Peter will explain in a few minutes, Energy Trading saw a small loss for the first quarter and that was also driven by unprecedented warm weather across the country. Our expectation for this business is to deliver results over the next 3 quarters similar to annualized historical levels, thus making it achievable to reach the low end of their guidance. And we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year and that's driven mainly by lower interest rates. So in total, we remain committed to our original earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 and target the midpoint of $3.80. 
Now turning to Page 8 is an overview of the rate case that we filed last week at MichCon. MichCon's gone nearly 3 years without a base rate increase. Now recall, we filed the case in 2010 and then we withdrew it when we determined that we could achieve our authorized return on equity without additional rates. The current rate of filing is just for under $77 million, that equates to roughly a 4% increase annually in base rates, so last rate increase. When you couple this with a decline in natural gas prices, the typical residential customer will see a lower bill in 2013 compared to recent years and combine equates to an annualized 5% decrease in residential bills. The 2 biggest drivers in rate case are capital investment and lower sales. We're seeing lower midstream revenue at MichCon and continued customer conservation since our last rate case and we continue to make investments in our aging infrastructure. Other highlights of the case include a simplified decoupling mechanism, an authorized return on equity of 11% which is consistent with MichCon's current authorized level. And maybe the most important element of this case is a proposal to implement an infrastructure recovery mechanism to support investments needed to replacing cast iron mains, moving gas meters out of customer homes and continuing the pipeline integrity work in our transmission system. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I'd like to also provide you an update on recent developments at Detroit Edison. Too many of you have seen on April 10, the state of Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision relating to an appeal on the January 2010 MPSE order. The 2 items of interest here are the revenue decoupling mechanism or RDM and AMI, the automated meters. First, regarding the RDM, the court determined that the MPSE exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of March 31, 2012, Edison had accrued on its book of regulatory liability related to the pilot RDM. It predominantly represents weather in prior periods. The MPFC has until May 22 to appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court and they are collecting comments through May 18. Now we will comment as part of that process, but ultimately, we're going to have to take the lead of the commission. So we're waiting to see how the commission plans to proceed on this. We've always been supportive of an energy efficiency only mechanism. And when coupled with a well functioning energy efficiency incentive program, we've been supportive of that. This is appeal by the FPSC to take some time before we learn of the Supreme Court, we'll hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that processes will take months to years before it's completed. So we're going to continue to maintain the RDM liability on our books and we also will not be implementing the 2012 RDM until we get further direction. 
Second item of note is the court's decision as it relates to AMI. Back in January of 2010, the improved approved the inclusion of $37 million in rate base related to the pilot program. However, the court found that the record of evidence in the case was insufficient and has this to the for further review. We provided the cost benefit analysis of the program and we believe this will be resolved in a positive manner. So with that background, let me pass it over to Peter and he'll take you through the quarter with some additional comments."

For the quarter, DTE Energy earnings were $0.91 consistent with reported earnings. Contributed $0.56 and MichCon which was affected by the unusually warm weather came in at $0.31. The non-utility segments combine to earn $0.13. The drivers for the non-utility first quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.10, Power & Industrial Projects to $0.05 and both Energy Trading and Unconventional Gas Production at a loss of $0.01 each. Had another loss at $0.09 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy were down $32 million for the quarter. Operating earnings are $96 million, down $1 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. MichCon which typically has a strong first quarter, had operating earnings of $52 million, down $31 million from prior year. 2/3 of its variance due to warm weather in 2012 and 1/3 driven by cold and normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. In other words, the whole variance is due to weather. Our non-utility segments in total are down $3 million driven primarily by the change in our earnings at our Trading segment. The much lower gas utility, our Gas business was also impacted by the unusually warm weather. In particular, this impacted our full requirement services transactions which historically has produced solid earnings. The first quarter of this year, we saw weather was post to 3 standard deviations. We priced our foreword permit deals and has the physical commodities assume some weather volatility but not to the extreme as we experienced. 
In the first quarter, the business saw lower margins, and lower volumes and was and powering gas hedges in the low-priced market. This 21 independence contains our standard Energy Trading Page showed both economic and accounting performance. In addition to the lower margins on existing deals, to level economic margins, our new deals was also down this quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Keeping on the same page and moving to the Power & Industrial projects, this segment was down $2 million. As June of first quarter, there was some lumpy earnings related to the early extinguishment of an onsite energy contract that shows up at the year-over-year variance. As Dave indicated earlier, our growth plans for the PNI business contract and we're comfortable with achieving the full year guidance in the segment and are driving towards the upper end. Gas Storage & Pipeline earnings are up slightly from the prior year due to the growth in the pipeline transportation revenues. Finally, Corporate & Other was up $3 million from last year due primarily to the refinancing activity done last year at historically low interest rates. 
Now, I'd like to turn to Page 12 to walk through some corporate details for Detroit Edison. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $96 million, down $1 million from prior year. There's a lot ins and outs for this segment this quarter. Margin for the quarter is up $9 million driven primarily by the 2011 rate order partially offset by warmer winter weather. In the supplemental peg as we provided with the earnings release, you will see that actual sales for the quarter are down 3% year-over-year quarter-over-quarter. This decline represents the impact of weather on the electric-related heating load. As in the weather impact, load was relatively flat for the quarter and we are forecasting approximately a 1% increase for the total year. Industrial sales were up 1% in the quarter which is a continued indication of the improving economic activity for Michigan. In other items and notice, all in them for the quarter impacted earnings by $8 million, primarily due to increased weather-related customer restoration activities and an increase in benefit expense which we anticipated with lower discount rates. That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flows and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remained a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first quarter this year, DTE Energy cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit the full year goals. Page 14 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year low within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies so far this year. Included in upgrade at Fitch and a positive outlook and Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to reach $300 million of new equity in 2012 for a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
Finally, liquidity remains strong with over $1.4 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Page 15 provides an overview update these cash flow in the first 3 months of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $600 million was down slightly from last year reflecting higher tax payments this quarter. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. Our total net cash was positive $100 million in the quarter. 
Page 16 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital at DTE is up sharply from the prior year. Some of the increases, for example, capital spending related to the schedule permits. The overall spending so for this year is consistent with a 25% year-over-year increase we expect in 2012. In the first quarter, capital was higher in all our unit business intruding renewable business and Detroit Edison and non-utility capital in our Gas Storage & Pipelines and Power & Industrial business lines. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, recording higher levels of investment across all our business. Let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

So, if you look at what's going on with low gas prices and then the impact on coal and think about DTE, actually one of the things that we've enjoyed over the years is our portfolio businesses do have different drivers and because of the way we're contracted and so on, it's really worked out well for us. So, now you take the midstream businesses as an example, we're we have long-term contracts with tenors of 7 to 8 years on the pipes and storage. And there's not only no impact there. We're actually seeing an opportunity near-term on short-term storage deals. If you went over the Power & Industrial business, there's really no impact related to coal prices and the Power & Industrial. And actually what we're seeing is some opportunity to sell some of our battery output that was not contracted for. And longer-term this gas price environment actually is an opportunity for that business. And I think you'll hear Gerry talk more about that at AGA. But our low gas price environment would give that group an opportunity to look at some new growth opportunities down the road. And then when you go over to Barnett, I think we have to stop thinking about this is a gas play. If right now we are drilling specifically for oil in the marble falls and 80% of the revenue is coming from oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are exiting that business but we are exiting on oil and NGL's not on gas."

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our VP and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
If you turn to Page 4, this morning we're going to cover our first quarter results, and we'll also discuss the recently filed rate case at MichCon. We'll be at the AGA financial forum on May 7 and 8, and we'll take that opportunity to update you on some of our growth projects of the 2 utilities, as well as the Gas Storage & Pipelines' Bluestone Project in the Power & Industrial, Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. 
We're expecting a high today of about 55 degrees here in Detroit. Actually it's a nice, sunny day, which is consistent with what you would expect here in Michigan in April. This is a sharp contrast to the first quarter, where we experienced anything but seasonal weather. Similar to many other parts of the country, the MichCon service territory saw one of the warmest winters on record. The mild temperatures were great news for our customers in form of lower utility bills. But as you've seen in our recent press release, the warm weather had an impact on the first quarter. We did include about $8 million of that weather from January and early February when we provide the guidance. 
So with that said, let me start on Page 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-terms earning growth per share. And when you combine that with our attractive dividends, it provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. All of this is set around one of our Northstars [ph] and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. Both of the utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, as we played out for you, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy, while at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including a long-term cast iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters out of customer homes. The importance of these infrastructure investments is evident in the rate case that we filed last Friday at MichCon. We have a very constructive energy legislation framework in Michigan and also a regulatory structure, and we see it as our responsibility to earn that favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement, capabilities in everything we do to ensure that our utilities are controlling costs and minimizing rate increases to our customers and also ensuring great customer experiences. 
Many of you have heard us talk about our intense focus that we have on continuous improvement. This is something we've been working on for many years, and I'll talk more about that when I talk about how we're going to offset weather this year. But it's something we take great pride in. As we look at the challenges of the quarter, we're going to use this continuous improvement program as a lever to help pull us in line with what our goals are for the entire year. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, both at the power industrial projects and Gas Storage & Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll give you a more detailed update on that at AGA in just over a week. 
On Page 6 is an overview of the quarter. In the face of the unusually warm winter, DTE Energy had operating earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.11 on the first quarter of last year. Detroit Edison earnings were flat year-over-year, while MichCon's earnings were down significantly due to the weather. Earnings at Energy Trading were down a little from last year, and we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95, and we're targeting the midpoint of $3.80. We'll leverage our cost and revenue opportunities across the portfolio businesses to offset the first quarter weather. And as we've indicated, it's a priority for us, and our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We generated over $600 million of cash from operations from the first quarter, and Nick will talk about that a little bit later in the call. 
Turning to Page 7, with the first quarter behind us, I'd like to take a few minutes to take you through how I'm thinking about our full year 2012 guidance. With a final order in the Detroit Edison rate case last fall, we are expecting earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year. And this is consistent with our original guidance that we provided you. As you know, the summer cooling months and storm activities are drivers of results at Detroit Edison, and much of that still lies ahead of us. Assuming normal weather, I am confident that Detroit Edison will hit its target and actually might get slightly above midpoint. With the biggest part of 2012 heating season behind us, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach its guidance range for the year. But with continuous improvement and potential onetime cost actions, the bottom end of the range is achievable. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines continues to provide solid earning streams. Additionally, we're looking at some revenue opportunities here in this business to help offset the challenges at MichCon. Year-over-year, we're expecting reduced emission fuels or REF, as we call it, to deliver a nice bump in operating earnings at the Power & Industrial projects. We're also looking at revenue enhancement opportunities in this business to offset the first quarter weather and other business units. So, for GSP and the Power & Industrial group, we're looking to drive both of those to the high end of their guidance range. 
As Peter will explain in a few minutes, Energy Trading saw a small loss for the first quarter, and that was also driven by unprecedented warm weather across the country. Our expectation for this business is to deliver results over the next 3 quarters similar to annualized historical levels, thus making it achievable to reach the low end of their guidance. And we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, and that's driven mainly by lower interest rates. So in total, we remain committed to our original earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 and target the midpoint of $3.80. 
Now turning to Page 8 is an overview of the rate case that we filed last week at MichCon. MichCon's gone nearly 3 years without a base rate increase. Now recall we filed a case in 2010 and then we withdrew it when we determined that we could achieve our authorized return on equity without additional rates. The current rate of filing is just for under $77 million, that equates to roughly a 4% increase annually in base rates since the last rate increase. When you couple this with a decline in natural gas prices, the typical residential customer will see a lower bill in 2013 compared to recent years. This combined equates to an annualized 5% decrease in residential bills. The 2 biggest drivers in the rate case are capital investment and lower sales. We're seeing lower midstream revenue at MichCon and continued customer conservation since our last rate case, and we continue to make investments in our aging infrastructure. 
Other highlights of the case include a simplified decoupling mechanism, an authorized return on equity of 11%, which is consistent with MichCon's current authorized level. And maybe the most important element of this case is a proposal to implement an infrastructure recovery mechanism to support the investments needed in replacing cast iron mains, moving gas meters out of customer homes and continuing the pipeline integrity work in our transmission system. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I'd like to also provide you an update on recent developments at Detroit Edison. As many of you have seen on April 10, the state of Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision relating to an appeal on the January 2010 MPSC order. The 2 items of interest here are the revenue decoupling mechanism or RDM and AMI, the automated meters. 
First, regarding the RDM, the court determined that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of March 31, 2012, Edison had accrued on its book a regulatory liability related to the pilot RDM, which predominantly represents weather in prior periods. The MPSC has until May 22 to appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, and they are collecting comments through May 18. We will comment as part of that process, but ultimately, we're going to have to take the leads of the commission, so we're waiting to see how the commission plans to proceed on this. 
We've always been supportive of an energy efficiency-only mechanism, and when coupled with a well-functioning energy efficiency incentive program, we've been supportive of that. If this is appealed by the MPSC, it could take some time. Before we learn of the Supreme Court, we'll hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that process will take months to years before it's completed. So we're going to continue to maintain the RDM liability on our books, and we also will not be implementing the 2012 RDM until we get further direction. 
The second item of note is the court's decision as it relates to AMI. Back in January of 2010, the MPSC approved the inclusion of $37 million in rate base related to the AMI pilot program. However, the court found that the record of evidence in the case was insufficient and has remanded this to the MPSC for further review. We provided the cost benefit analysis of the AMI program and we believe this will be resolved in a positive manner. So with that background, let me pass it over to Peter, and he'll take you through the quarter with some additional comments."

Let's move to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $32 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings are $96 million, down $1 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. MichCon, which typically has a strong first quarter, had operating earnings of $52 million, down $31 million from prior year, with 2/3 of its variance due to the warm weather in 2012 and 1/3 driven by colder-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. In other words, the whole variance is due to weather. Our Non-utility segments in total are down $3 million, driven primarily by the change in our earnings at our Trading segment. Similar to our gas utility, our Trading business was also impacted by the unusually warm weather. In particular, this impacted our full requirement services transactions, which historically has produced solid earnings. In the first quarter of this year, we saw weather that was close to 3 standard deviations. We prize our full requirement deals and has the physical commodity assuming some weather volatility, but not to the extreme as we experienced. 
So in the first quarter, the business saw lower margins and lower volumes and with long and towering gas hedges in the low-priced markets. Page 21 of the [indiscernible] contains our standard Energy Trading Page, which show both economic and accounting performance. In addition to the lower margins on the existing deals, the level of economic margin and new deals was also down this quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Keeping on the same page and moving to the Power & Industrial projects, this segment was down $2 million. Last year, in the first quarter, there was some lumpy earnings related to the early extinguishment of an on-site energy contract that shows up at the year-over-year variance. As Dave indicated earlier, our growth plans for the P&I business are on track and we are comfortable with achieving the full year guidance in the segment and are driving towards the upper end. Gas Storage & Pipeline earnings are up slightly from the prior year due to the growth in the pipeline transportation revenues. Finally, Corporate & Other was up $3 million from last year due primarily to the refinancing activity done last year at historically low interest rates. 
Now, I'd like to turn to Page 12 to walk through some quarterly details for Detroit Edison. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison are $96 million, down $1 million from prior year. There are a lot of ins and outs for this segment this quarter. Margin for the quarter is up $9 million, driven primarily by the 2011 rate order, partially offset by warmer winter weather. 
In the supplemental page that we provided with the earnings release, you will see that actual sales for the quarter are down 3% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. This decline represents the impact of weather on the electric-related heating load. Absent the weather impact, load was relatively flat for the quarter and we are forecasting approximately a 1% increase for the total year. Industrial sales were up 1% in the quarter, which is a continued indication of the improving economic activity for Michigan. Another item to note is O&M for the quarter impacted earnings by $8 million, primarily due to increased weather-related customer restoration activities and an increase in benefit expense, which we anticipated with lower discount rates. 
That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first quarter this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals.",330,"Thanks, Peter. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first quarter this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 14 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies so far this year, including an upgrade at Fitch and a positive outlook and Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to reach $300 million of new equity in 2012 through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
Finally, liquidity remains strong with over $1.4 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 months of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $600 million was down slightly from last year, reflecting higher tax payments this quarter. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was positive $100 million in the quarter. 
Page 16 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital at DTE is up sharply from the prior year. Some of the increase is timing, for example, capital spending related to the schedule of refueling at Fermi. But overall spending so far this year is consistent with the 25% year-over-year increase we expect in 2012. In the first quarter, capital was higher in all our business units, including renewable business in Detroit Edison and non-utility capital in our Gas Storage & Pipelines and Power & Industrial business lines. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our business. 
Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

So if you look at what's going on with low gas prices and then the impact on coal and think about DTE, actually one of the things that we've enjoyed over the years is our portfolio businesses do have different drivers, and because of the way we're contracted and so on, it's really worked out well for us. So you take the midstream businesses as an example, where we have long-term contracts with tenors of 7 to 8 years on the Pipes & Storage. And there's not only no impact there, we're actually seeing an opportunity near term on short-term storage deals. If you went over to the Power & Industrial business, there's really no impact related to coal prices and the Power & Industrial. And actually what we're seeing is some opportunity to sell some of our coke battery output that was not contracted for. In longer term this gas price environment actually is an opportunity for that business, and I think you'll hear Gerry talk more about that at AGA. But a low gas price environment would give that group an opportunity to look at some new growth opportunities down the road. And then when you go over to Barnett, I think we have to stop thinking about this as gas play. If -- right now we are drilling specifically for oil in the Marble Falls and 80% of the revenue is coming from oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are exiting that business, but we are exiting on oil and NGLs, not on gas."

And because of the level of capital, we'll be in regular rate cases. So we were okay with the decoupling mechanism. And if there wasn't one, we would be okay also.

It's one extra pay in the quarter, so there's probably close to 1% impact in the quarter. But by the end of the year, it's noise. So when you looked at it -- and I know you'll see in the supplemental we provide the actual sales, and I'll take it really class by class. First, the total actual sales were down 3%. Now the residential sales were down 5%, and I'll say that was predominantly weather. If you temperature normalize that, it'll be relatively flat in the quarter. And then on the full year for residential, we are looking at a relatively flat. And our energy efficiency programs really are targeted at that segment. So that's our assumption right now, it'll be flat in a temperature-normalized basis. 
The industrial sales -- actually, this class is pretty weather insensitive, and it was up 1% for the quarter. Now for the total year, right now our projection is there's a 2% growth for that. So that 1% actually is in line with that and maybe a little bit higher than we're anticipating from a run rate perspective. The commercial sales was down 3% in the quarter, and we look at that as all weather. We do see a little bit of uplift and the temperature normalized in the quarter and then the full year. It's about a 0.5% that we're going to be anticipating on a temperature-normalized basis."

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our VP and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
If you turn to Page 4, this morning we're going to cover our first quarter results, and we'll also discuss the recently filed rate case at MichCon. We'll be at the AGA financial forum on May 7 and 8, and we'll take that opportunity to update you on some of our growth projects of the 2 utilities, as well as the Gas Storage & Pipelines' Bluestone Project in the Power & Industrial, Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. 
We're expecting a high today of about 55 degrees here in Detroit. Actually it's a nice, sunny day, which is consistent with what you would expect here in Michigan in April. This is a sharp contrast to the first quarter, where we experienced anything but seasonal weather. Similar to many other parts of the country, the MichCon service territory saw one of the warmest winters on record. The mild temperatures were great news for our customers in form of lower utility bills. But as you've seen in our recent press release, the warm weather had an impact on the first quarter. We did include about $8 million of that weather from January and early February when we provide the guidance. 
So with that said, let me start on Page 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-terms earning growth per share. And when you combine that with our attractive dividends, it provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. All of this is set around one of our north stars and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. Both of the utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, as we played out for you, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy, while at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including a long-term cast iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters out of customer homes. The importance of these infrastructure investments is evident in the rate case that we filed last Friday at MichCon. We have a very constructive energy legislation framework in Michigan and also a regulatory structure, and we see it as our responsibility to earn that favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement, capabilities in everything we do to ensure that our utilities are controlling costs and minimizing rate increases to our customers and also ensuring great customer experiences. 
Many of you have heard us talk about our intense focus that we have on continuous improvement. This is something we've been working on for many years, and I'll talk more about that when I talk about how we're going to offset weather this year. But it's something we take great pride in. As we look at the challenges of the quarter, we're going to use this continuous improvement program as a lever to help pull us in line with what our goals are for the entire year. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, both at the power industrial projects and Gas Storage & Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll give you a more detailed update on that at AGA in just over a week. 
On Page 6 is an overview of the quarter. In the face of the unusually warm winter, DTE Energy had operating earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.11 on the first quarter of last year. Detroit Edison earnings were flat year-over-year, while MichCon's earnings were down significantly due to the weather. Earnings at Energy Trading were down a little from last year, and we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95, and we're targeting the midpoint of $3.80. We'll leverage our cost and revenue opportunities across the portfolio businesses to offset the first quarter weather. And as we've indicated, it's a priority for us, and our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We generated over $600 million of cash from operations from the first quarter, and Nick will talk about that a little bit later in the call. 
Turning to Page 7, with the first quarter behind us, I'd like to take a few minutes to take you through how I'm thinking about our full year 2012 guidance. With a final order in the Detroit Edison rate case last fall, we are expecting earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year. And this is consistent with our original guidance that we provided you. As you know, the summer cooling months and storm activities are drivers of results at Detroit Edison, and much of that still lies ahead of us. Assuming normal weather, I am confident that Detroit Edison will hit its target and actually might get slightly above midpoint. With the biggest part of 2012 heating season behind us, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach its guidance range for the year. But with continuous improvement and potential onetime cost actions, the bottom end of the range is achievable. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines continues to provide solid earning streams. Additionally, we're looking at some revenue opportunities here in this business to help offset the challenges at MichCon. Year-over-year, we're expecting reduced emission fuels or REF, as we call it, to deliver a nice bump in operating earnings at the Power & Industrial projects. We're also looking at revenue enhancement opportunities in this business to offset the first quarter weather and other business units. So, for GSP and the Power & Industrial group, we're looking to drive both of those to the high end of their guidance range. 
As Peter will explain in a few minutes, Energy Trading saw a small loss for the first quarter, and that was also driven by unprecedented warm weather across the country. Our expectation for this business is to deliver results over the next 3 quarters similar to annualized historical levels, thus making it achievable to reach the low end of their guidance. And we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, and that's driven mainly by lower interest rates. So in total, we remain committed to our original earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 and target the midpoint of $3.80. 
Now turning to Page 8 is an overview of the rate case that we filed last week at MichCon. MichCon's gone nearly 3 years without a base rate increase. Now recall we filed a case in 2010 and then we withdrew it when we determined that we could achieve our authorized return on equity without additional rates. The current rate of filing is just for under $77 million, that equates to roughly a 4% increase annually in base rates since the last rate increase. When you couple this with a decline in natural gas prices, the typical residential customer will see a lower bill in 2013 compared to recent years. This combined equates to an annualized 5% decrease in residential bills. The 2 biggest drivers in the rate case are capital investment and lower sales. We're seeing lower midstream revenue at MichCon and continued customer conservation since our last rate case, and we continue to make investments in our aging infrastructure. 
Other highlights of the case include a simplified decoupling mechanism, an authorized return on equity of 11%, which is consistent with MichCon's current authorized level. And maybe the most important element of this case is a proposal to implement an infrastructure recovery mechanism to support the investments needed in replacing cast iron mains, moving gas meters out of customer homes and continuing the pipeline integrity work in our transmission system. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I'd like to also provide you an update on recent developments at Detroit Edison. As many of you have seen on April 10, the state of Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision relating to an appeal on the January 2010 MPSC order. The 2 items of interest here are the revenue decoupling mechanism or RDM and AMI, the automated meters. 
First, regarding the RDM, the court determined that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of March 31, 2012, Edison had accrued on its book a regulatory liability related to the pilot RDM, which predominantly represents weather in prior periods. The MPSC has until May 22 to appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, and they are collecting comments through May 18. We will comment as part of that process, but ultimately, we're going to have to take the lead of the commission, so we're waiting to see how the commission plans to proceed on this. 
We've always been supportive of an energy efficiency-only mechanism, and when coupled with a well-functioning energy efficiency incentive program, we've been supportive of that. If this is appealed by the MPSC, it could take some time. Before we learn of the Supreme Court, we'll hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that process will take months to years before it's completed. So we're going to continue to maintain the RDM liability on our books, and we also will not be implementing the 2012 RDM until we get further direction. 
The second item of note is the court's decision as it relates to AMI. Back in January of 2010, the MPSC approved the inclusion of $37 million in rate base related to the AMI pilot program. However, the court found that the record of evidence in the case was insufficient and has remanded this to the MPSC for further review. We provided the cost benefit analysis of the AMI program and we believe this will be resolved in a positive manner. So with that background, let me pass it over to Peter, and he'll take you through the quarter with some additional comments."

I'd like to start with Slide 10 in the first quarter earnings result. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings are $0.91 consistent with reported earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $0.56, and MichCon,",709,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 10 in the first quarter earnings result. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings are $0.91 consistent with reported earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $0.56, and MichCon, which was affected by the unusually warm weather, came in at $0.31. The Non-utility segments combined earned $0.13. The drivers for the Non-utility first quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.10, Power & Industrial Projects to $0.05 and both Energy Trading and Unconventional Gas Production at a loss of $0.01 each. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.09 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $32 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings are $96 million, down $1 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. MichCon, which typically has a strong first quarter, had operating earnings of $52 million, down $31 million from prior year, with 2/3 of its variance due to the warm weather in 2012 and 1/3 driven by colder-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. In other words, the whole variance is due to weather. Our Non-utility segments in total are down $3 million, driven primarily by the change in our earnings at our Trading segment. Similar to our gas utility, our Trading business was also impacted by the unusually warm weather. In particular, this impacted our full requirement services transactions, which historically has produced solid earnings. In the first quarter of this year, we saw weather that was close to 3 standard deviations. We price our full requirement deals and has the physical commodity assuming some weather volatility, but not to the extreme as we experienced. 
So in the first quarter, the business saw lower margins and lower volumes and with long and towering gas hedges in the low-priced markets. Page 21 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading Page, which show both economic and accounting performance. In addition to the lower margins on the existing deals, the level of economic margin and new deals was also down this quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Keeping on the same page and moving to the Power & Industrial projects, this segment was down $2 million. Last year, in the first quarter, there was some lumpy earnings related to the early extinguishment of an outside energy contract that shows up at the year-over-year variance. As Dave indicated earlier, our growth plans for the P&I business are on track and we are comfortable with achieving the full year guidance in the segment and are driving towards the upper end. Gas Storage & Pipeline earnings are up slightly from the prior year due to the growth in the pipeline transportation revenues. Finally, Corporate & Other was up $3 million from last year due primarily to the refinancing activity done last year at historically low interest rates. 
Now, I'd like to turn to Page 12 to walk through some quarterly details for Detroit Edison. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison are $96 million, down $1 million from prior year. There are a lot of ins and outs for this segment this quarter. Margin for the quarter is up $9 million, driven primarily by the 2011 rate order, partially offset by warmer winter weather. 
In the supplemental page that we provided with the earnings release, you will see that actual sales for the quarter are down 3% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. This decline represents the impact of weather on the electric-related heating load. Absent the weather impact, load was relatively flat for the quarter and we are forecasting approximately a 1% increase for the total year. Industrial sales were up 1% in the quarter, which is a continued indication of the improving economic activity for Michigan. Another item to note is O&M for the quarter impacted earnings by $8 million, primarily due to increased weather-related customer restoration activities and an increase in benefit expense, which we anticipated with lower discount rates. 
That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first quarter this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 14 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies so far this year, including an upgrade at Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to reach $300 million of new equity in 2012 through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
Finally, liquidity remains strong with over $1.4 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 months of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $600 million was down slightly from last year, reflecting higher tax payments this quarter. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was positive $100 million in the quarter. 
Page 16 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital at DTE is up sharply from the prior year. Some of the increase is timing, for example, capital spending related to the schedule of refueling at Fermi. But overall spending so far this year is consistent with the 25% year-over-year increase we expect in 2012. In the first quarter, capital was higher in all our business units, including renewable business in Detroit Edison and non-utility capital in our Gas Storage & Pipelines and Power & Industrial business lines. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our business. 
Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

So if you look at what's going on with low gas prices and then the impact on coal and think about DTE, actually one of the things that we've enjoyed over the years is our portfolio businesses do have different drivers, and because of the way we're contracted and so on, it's really worked out well for us. So you take the midstream businesses as an example, where we have long-term contracts with tenors of 7 to 8 years on the Pipes & Storage. And there's not only no impact there, we're actually seeing an opportunity near term on short-term storage deals. If you went over to the Power & Industrial business, there's really no impact related to coal prices and the Power & Industrial. And actually what we're seeing is some opportunity to sell some of our coke battery output that was not contracted for. In longer term this gas price environment actually is an opportunity for that business, and I think you'll hear Gerry talk more about that at AGA. But a low gas price environment would give that group an opportunity to look at some new growth opportunities down the road. And then when you go over to Barnett, I think we have to stop thinking about this as gas play. If -- right now we are drilling specifically for oil in the Marble Falls and 80% of the revenue is coming from oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are exiting that business, but we are exiting on oil and NGLs, not on gas."

So when you looked at it -- and I know you'll see in the supplemental we provide the actual sales, and I'll take it really class by class. First, the total actual sales were down 3%. Now the residential sales were down 5%, and I'll say that was predominantly weather. If you temperature normalize that, it'll be relatively flat in the quarter. And then on the full year for residential, we are looking at a relatively flat. And our energy efficiency programs really are targeted at that segment. So that's our assumption right now, it'll be flat in a temperature-normalized basis. The industrial sales -- actually, this class is pretty weather insensitive, and it was up 1% for the quarter. Now for the total year, right now our projection is there's a 2% growth for that. So that 1% actually is in line with that and maybe a little bit higher than we're anticipating from a run rate perspective. The commercial sales was down 3% in the quarter, and once again we look at that as all weather. We do see a little bit of uplift and the temperature normalized in the quarter and then the full year.

And if you'll turn to Page 3 with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have some members of the management team with me in the room and on the phone if needed during the Q&A period. 
But before I jump into the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment just to update you on some recent announcement and management changes here on the finance and regulatory team as we continue to build and sustain just an outstanding finance and regulatory group. 
Effective September 1, Peter Oleksiak has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance and he'll have responsibility for the controller's organization and treasury which includes Investor Relations. 
Nick, who has been our Treasurer for over 11 years now, will assume the role of Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And Dan Brezinski, who is currently in the regulatory role will replace Nick as Vice President and Treasurer and Dan will also have Investor Relations reporting to him. So Nick and Dan are effectively trading places. 
With these changes, this marks the last quarterly earnings call for Nick and the Treasurer's office and I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to Nick for the passion and expertise he's brought to the Treasury group and the important role that he's played in working with the management team, the Board of Directors and the financial community to help DTE Energy achieve some great successes over these years, including pulling through some of the toughest economic times like 2008 and '09 that hopefully we will ever see in our life. 
Many of you have met Dan, and he's been involved in a number of Investor Relations events over the years. And you can look forward to seeing him going forward. 
And finally, congratulations to Peter on his well-deserved promotion. And you're not going to lose sight of Nick. He's only 50 feet from my office and he's going to continue to be involved with the investment and credit community. 
So turning to Page 4. This morning, we're going to cover our second quarter results and give you an update on some growth projects at our utilities and the non-utilities. So let me kick this off then on Slide 5. 
We like to ground all of our discussions with investors and what we call our investment thesis, as we believe this concisely summarizes the compelling reasons to invest in DTE Energy. 
We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide a 5% to 6% long-term earning growth per share. And when combined with our attractive dividend provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is underpinned by one of our key priorities and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Both utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron replacement work and a program to move gas meters that are currently inside customers' homes, outside customers' homes. 
We have a constructive regulatory structure in Michigan which is supported by solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we know it's our responsibility to turn this construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost and we are very focused on minimizing rate increases to our customers in providing our customers with a great level of service they deserve. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses as well, particularly in the power industrial group and the gas storage and pipelines. And I have some updates to share with you this morning on those businesses. 
So if you'll turn to Page 6. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Our operating earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.86 compared with $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. 
Like much of the Midwest, the summer here in Michigan is off to a warmer-than-normal start and actually we're on track to possibly one of the warmest summers on record. And that translates into strong earnings at Detroit Edison. 
As a reminder, Detroit Edison was decoupled for weather during the second quarter of 2011. So if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year analysis, the warm weather last year didn't flow through to the bottomline. 
Earnings at the power and industrial projects were up over the second quarter of last year and that's driven by the REF business line that's ramping up. And tough market conditions made it difficult for Energy Trading to generate margin in the second quarter. Peter will take you through some of the details on the quarter in a few minutes. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I'm reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share. As I will describe later, I'm confident of the midpoint of $3.80 and we could deliver higher than midpoint of earnings and we'll talk about that in a little bit. 
In June, our board approved 5.5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.48 beginning in October. This gives us a compounded annualized dividend growth rate of 5% over the last 3 years and demonstrates our board and our management team's confidence in our long-term growth plan. 
The balance sheet remained strong and we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first half of the year. 
In June of this year, Detroit Edison raised $500 million of 10 and 30 years secured debt at the lowest rates in the company's history. The proceeds from that debt offering will be used primarily to refinance higher cost debt which is maturing or callable later this year. 
On another topic, we have also been very clear about our strategy to exit the EMP business by selling our assets in the Barnett Shale. And we started talking to you last year about the shale formation called Marble Falls which is about the Barnett formation. DTE has been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich play. As we prove up the acreage, we have moved up way up the learning curve and we're now seeing top-tier returns from our vertical wells there. We recently concluded a study that shows a 50% increase in our total reserves over 2011, including 114% increase in the crude oil reserves. And you'll find additional details on the Barnett Marble Falls assets in the Appendix on Slide 22 and 23. 
We intend to go to market with these assets later this year and we will keep you posted on our progress and EEI is going to be a good time to give you an update on this and some of the other things that we have underway. 
Shifting to areas of growth for the company. In the second quarter, our brash economy wind park became fully pressure. This is the largest wind farm in the state of Michigan, with 212 megawatts of generating capacity. Construction is underway on our 110 megawatt thumb wind parks, which includes 3 sites in Yuron and counties. And in addition to those 2 projects, we recently announced another 110 megawatt wind development in Yuron county which will be constructed in 2013. All of these projects demonstrate the significant progress we're making in achieving the 10% renewable energy standard in Michigan by 2015 which we think is a good standard in the sense of all approach to approaching renewable energy. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we're very excited about the growth potential surrounding the Gas Midstream assets we have in the Marcellus shale region. Our first major project that we've been talking to you about is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system. And that project's moving along nicely. The tenant on the project has been seeing some very positive results in their drilling, so we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that we have in this area. 
As we work our way through the final stages of the right-of-away and permitting process and then move into the construction phases, we're still targeting the pipeline to go in service in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the P&I segment, we're pleased with the performance and throughput at the fireside [ph] REF reduced emission fuel machines and we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4 machines. In fact, the first of the 4 is being relocated as we speak and should be up and running in the third quarter. We also have completed negotiations with the host utility on the second of the 4 machines that will be relocated and we expect to finalize agreement began moving that machine soon. And then engage in advanced discussions with several other potential host sites for the last 2 machines. So our relocation process is on track and the goal is to have all of the REF machines sited and operational by the end of the year, which will provide a nice earnings bump in that segment for 2013. 
And for some new news in the P&I segment, we've shown you the forward projection goals that we're pursuing for this business where want to drive the earnings for $50 million this year to $125 million by 2016. And the step that we made is an acquisition of an on-site business line that we recently agreed to purchase from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. So this is a portfolio of on-site energy projects. These projects are primarily located in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions and they provide on-site utility and energy services. They're very similar to our existing on-site projects and they represent assets and equipment and technologies that we have extensive experience in. This acquisition will effectively double the size of our on-site business and expand our customer base broader into the Midwest. 
We target returns on these contracted services that are above our utility returns. And in addition to that, we get very good strong cash flows. 
So we see these projects making a significant contribution towards our goal of growing the P&I segment to $125 million in operating earnings by 2016. The acquisition will be funded by the parent of our balance sheet and the exact details of the funding requirements and timing has not yet been determined and the deal is not closed yet. It will close later this fall. 
So we still anticipate that we'll stay within our balance sheet targets even with this acquisition. And we do not see the need to raise equity beyond the $300 million requirement that we've communicated to you in 2012. 
Turning to Page 7 and talk a little bit about guidance. With half the year behind us, we remain committed to our full year 2012 earnings guidance. Detroit Edison came into the year with a plan of targeted its authorized return on equity. And with warmer-than-normal weather we're experiencing during the second quarter and then through the month of July, we now expect to see Detroit Edison come in above the upper end of the guidance range. 
Some of the July's weather favorability will be offset by increased storm cost as a result of significant storm activity we experienced in the beginning of the month. 
While Detroit Edison has benefited from weather this year, MichCon continues to dig out of the hole created by the extremely mild winter. Quite frankly, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach the low end of guidance for the year. But with continuous improvement work that we're doing and onetime cost actions, we think the bottomline of the range is achievable. 
With some revenue opportunities at gas storage and pipelines, we expect them to be at the upper end of the guidance range which will help offset some of the challenges of MichCon. 
And we continue to ramp up the REF business line and what we see is the P&I segment is going to end towards near the top end of the guidance range for the year. 
Energy Trading I'd already mentioned. Energy Trading turned in modest results for the quarter and it's still not at the level we would like to see. So for the year, we're signaling that Energy Trading will likely not reach the lower end of its guidance range. And due to the shape of the roll on that we would see for the rest of the year, the remaining profits that we would see for the remainder of the year, a good portion of that's going to be back end loaded and will show up in the fourth quarter. 
And finally, we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, driven mainly by lower interest rates from the refinancing that we've been actively doing. 
So in total, we are committed to our original operating earnings guidance range of $3.65 to $3.95 and the favorable weather continues that we've been seeing at Detroit Edison, we could be above the midpoint of that range. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I would like to give you an update on the regulatory item that we discussed in the first quarter. As you may recall back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC had seceded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. 
As of the first quarter, Edison has accrued $127 million as a regulatory liability related to the pilot revenue decoupling and is predominantly represented weather in prior years. 
The MPSC has until Monday to appeal that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. And we won't know until then what the commission will or won't do. If the commission appeals the decision, there could be sometime before we learn of the Supreme Court even hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that it could take months to years before it's completed. 
On the other hand if the MPSC doesn't appeal, we will propose an alternative to the commission that will support a regulatory strategy for Detroit Edison. Our goal is to minimize rate increases to customers while achieving our financial objectives. That said, the $127 million could be a key component of a plan to potentially push the need for base rate increases if Detroit Edison out in 2015. 
So with that overview, let me pass it over to Peter who would take you through some additional details on the quarter."

Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment over the quarter to do opportunities were $0.86. Detroit contributed $0.74. MichCon and operating loss for the second quarter came in at $0",818,"Thanks, David and good morning everyone. Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment over the quarter to do opportunities were $0.86. Detroit contributed $0.74. MichCon and operating loss for the second quarter came in at $0.02 of income and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. 
The Non-utility segments combined to earn $0.17. The driver for the Non-utility second quarter results were gas storage and pipeline at $0.10. Power and industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.02 and uncommercial gas production at a penny loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.07 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and the summary of our quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $35 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings were $127 million, up $27 million from the prior year. 
We have provided a quarter-over-quarter loss in Detroit Edison for reference, but the message was pretty straightforward. The favorability is primarily driven by warmer weather in the second quarter of 2012, paired with the elimination of the revenue decoupling mechanism. 
In addition, Detroit Edison's renewable investments provided incremental earnings as we continue to execute our investment plan there. 
July is also shaping up to be a strong weather-driven load month. Although as Dave pointed out, we have experienced increased storm restoration expenses which are likely to offset the portion of the improved margin. 
Summer through mid-July, we have just to give you just a few stats, we have 23 days at or above 90. Normal is 12. And of those, we have 4 of those days were above 100 degrees. As Dave mentioned in the guidance update, we are anticipating overall uplift from weather in the third quarter if the summer holds out. 
Putting weather aside, I know a number of you are interested in what's happening with our underlying load in the economy. So I want to give you a brief update. 
Temperature normalized electric load in the territory. When you look at it at a year-to-date, temperature taken out the impact of weather is relatively flat. As a reminder, we have pretty nice bounce back in sales after the 2008 and '09 economic downturn. And we have seen a 21% increase in sales alone since 2009. 
We are continuing to see a trend or growth in industrial sales. And actually year-to-date in the service territory, it's a 2% increase, really attributed to auto and auto-related manufacturing production. 
For the residential and commercial classes, we are seeing very positive results in our energy efficiency programs which have lowered the absolute load at both those classes year-over-year. 
For the year, we expect this flat load trend to continue, with continued energy efficiency savings offsetting territory growth. In the longer term, we're anticipating load increases close to 1% after the energy efficiency savings. 
Getting back to the earnings. Moving down the table, our MichCon segment had operating income of $4 million, up $7 million from the prior year. The earnings were driven by an accounting true up after the completion of the initial reconciliation of MichCon's revenue decoupling mechanism. 
MichCon also experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter that partially offset this benefit. 
Our Non-utility segments were nearly flat year-over-year, at $29 million earnings in the quarter. Gas storage and pipelines are up $3 million, resulting for stronger transport and storage revenues. 
Power and industrial projects is up $5 million due to REF project growth, partially offset by lower sales, volume and price. 
Energy Trading is down $8 million in the quarter due to commodity price environment that provided a lower-than-historical number of opportunities. 
In Appendix Slide 24, you'll see that our standard operating earnings to net economic and is well, you'll see that segment did have economic contributions significantly higher than the operating income. And this difference represents restructuring of some longer-term contract that will not realize net accounting benefit for 2 [ph] years out. 
As David mentioned, we expect that our full year earnings for trading will likely be below the guidance range of $30 million to $50 million at the commodity environment we've experienced in the first half of the year continues through the second half. 
For the second half of the year, we do expect Energy Trading and earnings to be back-end loaded, with about $10 million of after tax benefit coming in the fourth quarter due to roll on of earnings related to prior year's 4 [ph] requirement deals, with minimum roll on and earnings expended in the third quarter. 
Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $2 million from last year due to lower interest, partially offset by higher taxes in 2012. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, the last time in earnings call who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always and one last time, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. 
Through the first half of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. 
Page 12 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. 
In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies so far this year, including an upgrade of Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. 
As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to issue $300 million in new equity in 2012 through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
As Dave mentioned, DTE has been able to take advantage of historically low interest rate environment. During the last 18 months, we have issued or refinanced nearly $2 billion of long-term debt. 
Finally, liquidity remained strong, with over $1.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. 
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow so far this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.2 billion matched last year's level and we are well on our way towards full year target of $1.9 billion. 
As expected, capital is up compared to last year which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million in the first 6 months of 2012. 
Page 14 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital DTE is up about $100 million or 13% from the prior year. We expect increased levels of capital spending in the second half of the year and are on track to hit the prior forecast of $1.9 billion for all of 2012. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our businesses. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

The results for the first half of the year are solid and on track and I'm pleased with where we are that's why I'm confident reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 a share. 
As you heard, weather is affecting 2000 [ph] earnings at both utilities, MichCon to the negative and Detroit Edison to the positive. On a temperature normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn or authorize return on equity. But it's still too early for us to remix the guidance for the year, but the weather-driven favorability looks like it will offset any at Energy Trading and that the weather also if it continues as we've indicated could push us above the $3.80 midpoint on our full year earnings per share guidance. 
Long-term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated investments at the utilities and we're seeing very nice growth potential in our Non-utility businesses and they combine together to provide long-term growth of 5% to 6% earnings per share. And as we've said and we will always say, we do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow metrics. 
Over the last 3 years, we've increased the annualized dividend 5% on a compounded basis. And as we continue to achieve our long-term earnings per share growth, we expect the dividend will continue to grow as well. 
We will back on the road at the end of the summer and we'll likely see many of you at either the Barclays or the Banc of America conference in New York in September. And with that, Evelyn, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

And also plants that are going to run over the lifetime of the credit. And so we're working with a handful of host utilities and I can't tell you where this is going at.

Looking at Page 2 just briefly before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement, including the reference to forward-looking statements. 
And if you'll turn to Page 3, with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have some members of the management team with me in the room and on the phone if needed during the Q&A period. 
But before I jump into the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment just to update you on some recent announcement and management changes here on the finance and regulatory team as we continue to build and sustain just an outstanding finance and regulatory group. 
Effective September 1, Peter Oleksiak has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance, and he'll have responsibility for the controller's organization and treasury, which includes Investor Relations. Nick, who has been our Treasurer for over 11 years now, will assume the role of Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And Dan Brudzynski, who is currently in the regulatory role will replace Nick as Vice President and Treasurer, and Dan will also have Investor Relations reporting to him. So Nick and Dan are effectively trading places. 
With these changes, this marks the last quarterly earnings call for Nick in the Treasurer's office and I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to Nick for the passion and expertise he's brought to the Treasury group and the important role that he's played in working with the management team, the Board of Directors and the financial community to help DTE Energy achieve some great successes over these years, including pulling through some of the toughest economic times like 2008 and '09 that hopefully, we will ever see in our life. 
Many of you have met Dan, and he's been involved in a number of Investor Relation events over the years, and you can look forward to seeing him going forward. And finally, congratulations to Peter on his well-deserved promotion. And you're not going to lose sight of Nick. He's only 50 feet from my office and he's going to continue to be involved with the investment and credit community. 
So turning to Page 4. This morning, we're going to cover our second quarter results and give you an update on some growth projects at our utilities and the nonutilities. So let me kick this off then on Slide 5. We like to ground all of our discussions with investors in what we call our investment thesis, as we believe this concisely summarizes the compelling reasons to invest in DTE Energy. 
We have a disciplined growth plan that'll provide a 5% to 6% long-term earning growth per share. And when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is underpinned by one of our key priorities and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Both utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacement work and a program to move gas meters that are currently inside customers' homes to outside customers' homes. 
We have a constructive regulatory structure in Michigan, which is supported by a solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we know it's our responsibility to turn this construct everyday. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost and we are very focused on minimizing rate increases to our customers in providing our customers with a great level of service they deserve. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly in the Power & Industrial group and the Gas Storage & Pipelines. And I have some updates that I'll share with you this morning on those businesses. 
So if you'll turn to Page 6. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Our operating earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.86 compared with $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. Like much of the Midwest, the summer here in Michigan is off to a warmer-than-normal start, and actually we're on a track to possibly one of the warmest summers on record. And that translates into strong earnings at Detroit Edison. 
As a reminder, Detroit Edison was decoupled for weather during the second quarter of 2011. So if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year analysis, the warm weather last year didn't flow through to the bottom line. 
Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over the second quarter of last year and that's driven by the REF business line that's ramping up. And tough market conditions made it difficult for Energy Trading to generate margin in the second quarter. Peter will take you through some of the details on the quarter in a few minutes. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I am reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share. As I will describe later, I'm confident of the midpoint of $3.80 and we could deliver higher than midpoint earnings, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. 
In June, our board approved the 5.5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.48 beginning in October. This gives us a compounded annualized dividend growth rate of 5% over the last 3 years and demonstrates our board and our management team's confidence in our long-term growth plan. The balance sheet remained strong and we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first half of the year. 
In June of this year, Detroit Edison raised $500 million of 10- and 30-years secured debt at the lowest rates in the company's history. The proceeds from that debt offering will be used primarily to refinance higher cost debt, which is maturing or callable later this year.  
On another topic, we have also been very clear about our strategy to exit the E&P business by selling our assets in the Barnett Shale. And we started talking to you last year about the shale formation called Marble Falls, which is just about the Barnett formation. DTE has been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich play. As we prove up the acreage, we've had moved way up the learning curve and that we're now seeing top-tier returns from our vertical wells there. 
We recently concluded a study that shows a 50% increase in our total reserves over 2011, including 114% increase in the crude oil reserves. And you'll find additional details on the Barnett Marble Falls assets in the Appendix on Slide 22 and 23. We intend to go to market with these assets later this year and we will keep you posted on our progress. And EEI is going to be a good time to give you an update on this and some of the other things that we have underway. 
Shifting to areas of growth for the company. In the second quarter, our brash economy wind park became fully operational. This is the largest wind farm in the state of Michigan, with 212 megawatts of generating capacity. Construction is underway on our 110-megawatt thumb wind parks, which includes 3 sites in Huron and Sanilac Counties. And in addition to those 2 projects, we recently announced another 110-megawatt wind development in Huron County, which will be constructed in 2013. All of these projects demonstrate the significant progress we're making in achieving the 10% renewable energy standard in Michigan by 2015, which we think is a good standard in a sensible approach to approaching renewable energy. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we're very excited about the growth potential surrounding the Gas Midstream assets we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major project that we've been talking to you about is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system. And that project's moving along nicely. The anchor tenant on the project has been seeing some very positive results in their drilling, so we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that we have in this area. As we work our way through the final stages of the right-of-away and permitting process and then move into the construction phases, we're still targeting the pipeline to go in service in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the P&I segment, we're pleased with the performance and throughput at the 5 sited REF reduced emission fuel machines, and we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4 machines. In fact, the first of the 4 is being relocated as we speak and should be up and running in the third quarter. We also have completed negotiations with the host utility on the second of the 4 machines that will be relocated, and we expect to finalize agreements and begin moving that machine soon. And we're engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the last 2 machines. So our relocation process is on track and the goal is to have all of the REF machines sited and operational by the end of the year, which will provide a nice earnings bump in that segment for 2013. 
And for some new news in the P&I segment, we've shown you the forward projection goals that we're pursuing for this business, where want to drive the earnings for $50 million this year to $125 million by 2016. And the step that we made is an acquisition of an on-site business line that we recently agreed to purchase from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. So this is a portfolio of on-site energy projects. These projects are primarily located in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions and they provide on-site utility and energy services. They're very similar to our existing on-site projects, and they represent assets and equipment and technologies that we have extensive experience in. This acquisition will effectively double the size of our on-site business and expands our customer base broader into the Midwest. We target returns on these contracted services that are above our utility returns. And in addition to that, we get very good strong cash flows. 
So we see these projects making a significant contribution towards our goal of growing the P&I segment to $125 million in operating earnings by 2016. The acquisition will be funded by the parent, off our balance sheet by the end -- the exact details of the funding requirements and timing has not yet been determined. And the deal is not closed yet, it will close later this fall. So we still anticipate that we'll stay within our balance sheet targets even with this acquisition. And we do not see the need to raise equity beyond the $300 million requirement that we've communicated to you in 2012. 
Turning to Page 7, and talk a little bit about guidance. With half the year behind us, we remain committed to our full year 2012 earnings guidance. Detroit Edison came into the year with a plan that targeted that's authorized return on equity. And with warmer-than-normal weather we're experiencing during the second quarter and then through the month of July, we now expect to see Detroit Edison come in above the upper end of the guidance range. Some of the July's weather favorability will be offset by increased storm cost as a result of significant storm activity we experienced in the beginning of the month. 
While Detroit Edison has benefited from weather this year, MichCon continues to dig out of the hole created by the extremely mild winter. Quite frankly, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach the low end of guidance for the year. But with continuous improvement work that we're doing and onetime cost actions, we think the bottom lines of the range is achievable. With some revenue opportunities at Gas Storage & Pipelines, we expect them to be at the upper end of the guidance range, which will help offset some of the challenges of MichCon. And we continue to ramp up the REF business line and what we see is the P&I segment is going to end towards -- near the top end of the guidance range for the year. 
Energy Trading. I had already mentioned, Energy Trading turned in modest results for the quarter and it's still not at the level we would like to see. So for the year, we're signaling that Energy Trading will likely not reach the lower end of its guidance range. And due to the shape of the roll on that we would see for the rest of the year, the remaining profits that we would see for the remainder of the year, a good portion of that's going to be back-end loaded and will show up in the fourth quarter. 
And finally, we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, driven mainly by lower interest rates from the refinancing that we've been actively doing. So in total, we are committed to our original operating earnings guidance range of $3.65 to $3.95 and the favorable weather continues that we've been seeing at Detroit Edison, we could be above the midpoint of that range. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I would like to give you an update on the regulatory item that we discussed in the first quarter. As you may recall, back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC had seceded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of the first quarter, Edison had accrued $127 million as a regulatory liability related to the pilot revenue decoupling, and this predominantly represented weather in prior years. 
The MPSC has until Monday to appeal that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. And we won't know until then what the commission will or won't do. If the commission appeals the decision, there could be some time before we learn of the Supreme Court even will hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that it could take months to years before it's completed. 
On the other hand if the MPSC doesn't appeal, we will propose an alternative to the commission that will support our regulatory strategy for Detroit Edison. Our goal is to minimize rate increases to customers, while achieving our financial objectives. That said, the $127 million could be a key component of a plan to potentially push the need for base rate increases at Detroit Edison out to 2015. 
So with that overview, let me pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."
266598,213783702,333133,"DTE Energy Co., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically i",844,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter, came in at $0.02 of income, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.17. The driver for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.10. Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.02 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.07 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and the summary of our quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $35 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings were $127 million, up $27 million from the prior year. 
We have provided a quarter-over-quarter walk in the Appendix in Detroit Edison for reference, but the message was pretty straightforward. The favorability is primarily driven by warmer weather in the second quarter of 2012, paired with the elimination of the revenue decoupling mechanism. 
In addition, Detroit Edison's renewable investments provided incremental earnings as we continue to execute our investment plan there. 
July is also shaping up to be a strong weather-driven load month. Although as Dave pointed out, we have experienced increased storm restoration expenses, which are likely to offset the portion of the improved margin. 
Summer through mid-July, we had, just to give you just a few stats, we have had 23 days at/or above 90, normal is 12. And actually, of those, we have 4 of those days we're above 100 degrees. And as Dave mentioned in the guidance update, we are anticipating an overall uplift from weather in the third quarter if the summer holds out. 
Putting weather aside, I know a number of you are interested in terms of what's happening with our underlying load in the economy. So I want to give you a brief update. Temperature normalized electric load in the territory. When you look at it at a year-to-date, temperature taken out the impact of weather is relatively flat. As a reminder, we had a pretty nice bounce back in sales after the 2008 and '09 economic downturn. And we have seen a 21% increase in sales alone since 2009. 
We are continuing to see a trend of growth in industrial sales. And actually year-to-date in the service territory, it's a 2% increase, really attributed to auto and auto-related manufacturing production. For the residential and commercial classes, we are seeing very positive results in our energy efficiency programs, which have lowered the absolute load in both those classes year-over-year. 
For the year, we expect this flat load trend to continue, with continued energy efficiency savings offsetting territory growth. In the longer term, we're anticipating load increases close to 1% after the energy efficiency savings. 
Getting back to the earnings. Moving down the table, our MichCon segment had operating income of $4 million, up $7 million from the prior year. The favorable earnings were driven mainly by an accounting true-up after the completion of the initial reconciliation of MichCon's revenue decoupling mechanism. MichCon also experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter that partially offset this benefit. 
Our non-utility segments were nearly flat year-over-year at $29 million earnings in the quarter. Gas Storage & Pipelines is up $3 million, resulting for stronger transport and storage revenues. Power & Industrial projects is up $5 million due to REF project growth, partially offset by lower coke sales, volume and price.  Energy Trading is down $8 million in the quarter due to commodity price environment that provided a lower-than-historical number of opportunities. 
In Appendix Slide 24, you'll see that our standard operating earnings to net -- economic net income walk. In this walk, you will see that the segment did have economic contributions significantly higher than the operating income. Now this difference represents restructuring of some longer-term contracts that will not realize net accounting benefit for a few years out. 
As David mentioned, we expect that our full year earnings for trading will likely be below the guidance range of $30 million to $50 million if the commodity environment we have experienced in the first half of the year continues through the second half. For the second half of the year, we do expect 
Energy Trading and earnings to be back-end loaded, with about $10 million of after tax benefit coming in the fourth quarter due to roll on of earnings related to prior year's full requirement deals, with minimum roll on and earnings expended in the third quarter. Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $2 million from last year due to lower interest, partially offset by higher taxes in 2012. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, the last time in an earnings call, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."
266598,213783702,333133,"DTE Energy Co., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Good morning.

As always and one last time, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains the key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first half of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 12 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. 
In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies, so far this year, including an upgrade of Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to issue $300 million of new equity in 2012, through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
As Dave mentioned, DTE has been able to take advantage of historically low interest rate environment. During the last 18 months, we have issued or refinanced nearly $2 billion of long-term debt. Finally, liquidity remained strong, with over $1.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. 
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow, so far this year, versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.2 billion matched last year's level and we are well on our way towards full year target of $1.9 billion. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million in the first 6 months of 2012. 
Page 14 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital DTE is up about $100 million or 13% from the prior year. We expect increased levels of capital spending in the second half of the year and are on track to hit the prior forecast of $1.9 billion for all of 2012. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our businesses. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

The results for the first half of the year are solid and on track, and I'm pleased with where we are. And that's why I'm confident reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 a share. 
As you heard, weather is affecting 2000 (sic) [ 2012 ] earnings at both utilities, MichCon to the negative and Detroit Edison to the positive. On a temperature normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn or authorize return on equity. But it's still too early for us to remix the guidance for the year, but the weather-driven favorability looks like it will offset any mess at Energy Trading. And that the weather also, if it continues as we've indicated, could push us above the $3.80 midpoint on our full year earnings per share guidance. 
Long term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated investments at the utilities and we're seeing very nice growth potential at our non-utility businesses, and they combine together to provide long-term growth of 5% to 6% earnings per share. And as we've said, and we will always say, we do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow metrics. 
Over the last 3 years, we've increased the annualized dividend 5% on a compounded basis. And as we continue to achieve our long-term earnings per share growth, we expect the dividend will continue to grow as well. 
We'll be back on the road at the end of the summer and we'll likely see many of you at either the Barclays or the Banc of America Conference in New York in September. And with that, Evelyn, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

But when you look at, even for the year for residential, when you look on a pure temperature normal basis year-to-date actually we're above.

Looking at Page 2 just briefly before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement, including the reference to forward-looking statements. 
And if you'll turn to Page 3, with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have some members of the management team with me in the room and on the phone if needed during the Q&A period. 
But before I jump into the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment just to update you on some recent announcements and management changes here on the finance and regulatory team as we continue to build and sustain just an outstanding finance and regulatory group. 
Effective September 1, Peter Oleksiak has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance, and he'll have responsibility for the controller's organization and treasury, which includes Investor Relations. Nick, who has been our Treasurer for over 11 years now, will assume the role of Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And Dan Brudzynski, who is currently in the regulatory role will replace Nick as Vice President and Treasurer, and Dan will also have Investor Relations reporting to him. So Nick and Dan are effectively trading places. 
With these changes, this marks the last quarterly earnings call for Nick in the Treasurer's office and I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to Nick for the passion and expertise he's brought to the Treasury group and the important role that he's played in working with the management team, the Board of Directors and the financial community to help DTE Energy achieve some great successes over these years, including pulling through some of the toughest economic times like 2008 and '09 that hopefully, we will ever see in our life. 
Many of you have met Dan, and he's been involved in a number of Investor Relation events over the years, and you can look forward to seeing him going forward. And finally, congratulations to Peter on his well-deserved promotion. And you're not going to lose sight of Nick. He's only 50 feet from my office and he's going to continue to be involved with the investment and credit community. 
So turning to Page 4. This morning, we're going to cover our second quarter results and give you an update on some growth projects at our utilities and the nonutilities. So let me kick this off then on Slide 5. We like to ground all of our discussions with investors in what we call our investment thesis, as we believe this concisely summarizes the compelling reasons to invest in DTE Energy. 
We have a disciplined growth plan that'll provide a 5% to 6% long-term earning growth per share. And when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is underpinned by one of our key priorities and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Both utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacement work and a program to move gas meters that are currently inside customers' homes to outside customers' homes. 
We have a constructive regulatory structure in Michigan, which is supported by a solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we know it's our responsibility to earn this construct everyday. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost and we are very focused on minimizing rate increases to our customers and providing our customers with a great level of service they deserve. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly in the Power & Industrial group and the Gas Storage & Pipelines. And I have some updates that I'll share with you this morning on those businesses. 
So if you'll turn to Page 6. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Our operating earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.86 compared with $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. Like much of the Midwest, the summer here in Michigan is off to a warmer-than-normal start, and actually we're on a track to possibly one of the warmest summers on record. And that translates into strong earnings at Detroit Edison. 
As a reminder, Detroit Edison was decoupled for weather during the second quarter of 2011. So if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year analysis, the warm weather last year didn't flow through to the bottom line. 
Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over the second quarter of last year and that's driven by the REF business line that's ramping up. And tough market conditions made it difficult for Energy Trading to generate margin in the second quarter. Peter will take you through some of the details on the quarter in a few minutes. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I am reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share. As I will describe later, I'm confident of the midpoint of $3.80 and we could deliver higher than midpoint earnings, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. 
In June, our board approved the 5.5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.48 beginning in October. This gives us a compounded annualized dividend growth rate of 5% over the last 3 years and demonstrates our board and our management team's confidence in our long-term growth plan. The balance sheet remained strong and we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first half of the year. 
In June of this year, Detroit Edison raised $500 million of 10- and 30-years secured debt at the lowest rates in the company's history. The proceeds from that debt offering will be used primarily to refinance higher cost debt, which is maturing or is callable later this year.  
On another topic, we have also been very clear about our strategy to exit the E&P business by selling our assets in the Barnett Shale. And we started talking to you last year about the shale formation called Marble Falls, which is just above the Barnett formation. DTE has been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich play. As we prove up the acreage, we've had moved way up the learning curve and that we're now seeing top-tier returns from our vertical wells there. 
We recently concluded a study that shows a 50% increase in our total reserves over 2011, including 114% increase in the crude oil reserves. And you'll find additional details on the Barnett Marble Falls assets in the Appendix on Slide 22 and 23. We intend to go to market with these assets later this year and we will keep you posted on our progress. And EEI is going to be a good time to give you an update on this and some of the other things that we have underway. 
Shifting to areas of growth for the company. In the second quarter, our Gratiot County wind park became fully operational. This is the largest wind farm in the state of Michigan, with 212 megawatts of generating capacity. Construction is underway on our 110-megawatt thumb wind parks, which includes 3 sites in Huron and Sanilac Counties. And in addition to those 2 projects, we recently announced another 110-megawatt wind development in Huron County, which will be constructed in 2013. All of these projects demonstrate the significant progress we're making in achieving the 10% renewable energy standard in Michigan by 2015, which we think is a good standard and a sensible approach to approaching renewable energy. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we're very excited about the growth potential surrounding the Gas Midstream assets we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major project that we've been talking to you about is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system. And that project's moving along nicely. The anchor tenant on the project has been seeing some very positive results in their drilling, so we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that we have in this area. As we work our way through the final stages of the right-of-away and permitting process and then move into the construction phases, we're still targeting the pipeline to go in service in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the P&I segment, we're pleased with the performance and throughput at the 5 sited REF reduced emission fuel machines, and we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4 machines. In fact, the first of the 4 is being relocated as we speak and should be up and running in the third quarter. We also have completed negotiations with the host utility on the second of the 4 machines that will be relocated, and we expect to finalize agreements and begin moving that machine soon. And we're engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the last 2 machines. So our relocation process is on track and the goal is to have all of the REF machines sited and operational by the end of the year, which will provide a nice earnings bump in that segment for 2013. 
And for some new news in the P&I segment, we've shown you the forward projection goals that we're pursuing for this business, where we want to drive the earnings for $50 million this year to $125 million by 2016. And the step that we made is an acquisition of an on-site business line that we recently agreed to purchase from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. So this is a portfolio of on-site energy projects. These projects are primarily located in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions and they provide on-site utility and energy services. They're very similar to our existing on-site projects, and they represent assets and equipment and technologies that we have extensive experience in. This acquisition will effectively double the size of our on-site business and expands our customer base broader into the Midwest. We target returns on these contracted services that are above our utility returns. And in addition to that, we get very good strong cash flows. 
So we see these projects making a significant contribution towards our goal of growing the P&I segment to $125 million in operating earnings by 2016. The acquisition will be funded by the parent, off our balance sheet by the end -- the exact details of the funding requirements and timing has not yet been determined. And the deal is not closed yet, it will close later this fall. So we still anticipate that we'll stay within our balance sheet targets even with this acquisition. And we do not see the need to raise equity beyond the $300 million requirement that we've communicated to you in 2012. 
Turning to Page 7, and talk a little bit about guidance. With half the year behind us, we remain committed to our full year 2012 earnings guidance. Detroit Edison came into the year with a plan that targeted that's authorized return on equity. And with warmer-than-normal weather we're experiencing during the second quarter and then through the month of July, we now expect to see Detroit Edison come in above the upper end of the guidance range. Some of the July's weather favorability will be offset by increased storm cost as a result of significant storm activity we experienced in the beginning of the month. 
While Detroit Edison has benefited from weather this year, MichCon continues to dig out of the hole created by the extremely mild winter. Quite frankly, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach the low end of guidance for the year. But with continuous improvement work that we're doing and onetime cost actions, we think the bottom ends of the range is achievable. With some revenue opportunities at Gas Storage & Pipelines, we expect them to be at the upper end of the guidance range, which will help offset some of the challenges of MichCon. And we continue to ramp up the REF business line and what we see is the P&I segment is going to end towards -- near the top end of the guidance range for the year. 
Energy Trading. I had already mentioned, Energy Trading turned in modest results for the quarter and it's still not at the level we would like to see. So for the year, we're signaling that Energy Trading will likely not reach the lower end of its guidance range. And due to the shape of the roll on that we would see for the rest of the year -- the remaining profits that we would see for the remainder of the year, a good portion of that's going to be back-end loaded and will show up in the fourth quarter. 
And finally, we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, driven mainly by lower interest rates from the refinancing that we've been actively doing. So in total, we are committed to our original operating earnings guidance range of $3.65 to $3.95 and the favorable weather continues that we've been seeing at Detroit Edison, we could be above the midpoint of that range. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I would like to give you an update on the regulatory item that we discussed in the first quarter. As you may recall, back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC had exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of the first quarter, Edison had accrued $127 million as a regulatory liability related to the pilot revenue decoupling, and this predominantly represented weather in prior years. 
The MPSC has until Monday to appeal that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. And we won't know until then what the commission will or won't do. If the commission appeals the decision, there could be some time before we learn of the Supreme Court even will hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that it could take months to years before it's completed. 
On the other hand if the MPSC doesn't appeal, we will propose an alternative to the commission that will support our regulatory strategy for Detroit Edison. Our goal is to minimize rate increases to customers, while achieving our financial objectives. That said, the $127 million could be a key component of a plan to potentially push the need for base rate increases at Detroit Edison out to 2015. 
So with that overview, let me pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."
266598,213783702,333284,"DTE Energy Co., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically i",845,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter, came in at $0.02 of income, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.17. The driver for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.10. Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.02 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.07 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and the summary of our quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $35 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings were $127 million, up $27 million from the prior year. 
We have provided a quarter-over-quarter walk in the Appendix in Detroit Edison for reference, but the message was pretty straightforward. The favorability is primarily driven by warmer weather in the second quarter of 2012, paired with the elimination of the revenue decoupling mechanism. 
In addition, Detroit Edison's renewable investments provided incremental earnings as we continue to execute our investment plan there. 
July is also shaping up to be a strong weather-driven load month. Although as Dave pointed out, we have experienced increased storm restoration expenses, which are likely to offset the portion of the improved margin. 
Summer through mid-July, we had, just to give you just a few stats, we have had 23 days at/or above 90, normal is 12. And actually, of those, we have 4 of those days we're above 100 degrees. And as Dave mentioned in the guidance update, we are anticipating an overall uplift from weather in the third quarter if the summer holds out. 
Putting weather aside, I know a number of you are interested in terms of what's happening with our underlying load in the economy. So I want to give you a brief update. Temperature normalized electric load in the territory. When you look at it at a year-to-date, temperature taken out the impact of weather is relatively flat. As a reminder, we had a pretty nice bounce back in sales after the 2008 and '09 economic downturn. And we have seen a 21% increase in sales alone since 2009. 
We are continuing to see a trend of growth in industrial sales. And actually year-to-date in the service territory, it's a 2% increase, really attributed to auto and other related manufacturing production. For the residential and commercial classes, we are seeing very positive results in our energy efficiency programs, which have lowered the absolute load in both those classes year-over-year. 
For the year, we expect this flat load trend to continue, with continued energy efficiency savings offsetting territory growth. In the longer term, we're anticipating load increases close to 1% after the energy efficiency savings. 
Getting back to the earnings. Moving down the table, our MichCon segment had operating income of $4 million, up $7 million from the prior year. The favorable earnings were driven mainly by an accounting true-up after the completion of the initial reconciliation of MichCon's revenue decoupling mechanism. MichCon also experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter that partially offset this benefit. 
Our non-utility segments were nearly flat year-over-year at $29 million earnings in the quarter. Gas Storage & Pipelines is up $3 million, resulting for stronger transport and storage revenues. Power & Industrial projects is up $5 million due to REF project growth, partially offset by lower coke sales, volume and price.  Energy Trading is down $8 million in the quarter due to commodity price environment that provided a lower-than-historical number of opportunities. 
In Appendix Slide 24, you'll see that our standard operating earnings to net -- economic net income walk. In this walk, you will see that the segment did have economic contributions significantly higher than the operating income. Now this difference represents restructuring of some longer-term contracts that will not realize net accounting benefit for a few years out. 
As David mentioned, we expect that our full year earnings for trading will likely be below the guidance range of $30 million to $50 million if the commodity environment we have experienced in the first half of the year continues through the second half. For the second half of the year, we do expect 
Energy Trading and earnings to be back-end loaded, with about $10 million of after tax benefit coming in the fourth quarter due to roll on of earnings related to prior year's full requirement deals, with minimum roll on and earnings expended in the third quarter. Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $2 million from last year due to lower interest, partially offset by higher taxes in 2012. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, the last time in an earnings call, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always and one last time, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains the key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first half of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 12 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. 
In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies, so far this year, including an upgrade of Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to issue $300 million of new equity in 2012, through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
As Dave mentioned, DTE has been able to take advantage of historically low interest rate environment. During the last 18 months, we have issued or refinanced nearly $2 billion of long-term debt. Finally, liquidity remained strong, with over $1.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. 
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow so far this year, versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.2 billion matched last year's level and we are well on our way towards full year target of $1.9 billion. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million in the first 6 months of 2012. 
Page 14 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital DTE is up about $100 million or 13% from the prior year. We expect increased levels of capital spending in the second half of the year and are on track to hit the prior forecast of $1.9 billion for all of 2012. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our businesses. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

The results for the first half of the year are solid and on track, and I'm pleased with where we are. And that's why I'm confident reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 a share. 
As you heard, weather is affecting 2000 (sic) 
 earnings at both utilities, MichCon to the negative and Detroit Edison to the positive. On a temperature normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized return on equity. But it's still too early for us to remix the guidance for the year, but the weather-driven favorability looks like it will offset any miss at Energy Trading. And that the weather also, if it continues as we've indicated, could push us above the $3.80 midpoint on our full year earnings per share guidance. 
Long term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated investments at the utilities and we're seeing very nice growth potential at our non-utility businesses, and they combine together to provide long-term growth of 5% to 6% earnings per share. And as we've said, and we will always say, we do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow metrics. 
Over the last 3 years, we've increased the annualized dividend 5% on a compounded basis. And as we continue to achieve our long-term earnings per share growth, we expect the dividend will continue to grow as well. 
We'll be back on the road at the end of the summer and we'll likely see many of you at either the Barclays or the Banc of America Conference in New York in September. And with that, Evelyn, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

But when you look at, even for the year for residential, when you look on a pure temperature normal basis year-to-date actually we're above.

And if you'll turn to Page 3, with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have some members of the management team with me in the room and on the phone if needed during the Q&A period. 
But before I jump into the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment just to update you on some recent announcements and management changes here on the finance and regulatory team as we continue to build and sustain just an outstanding finance and regulatory group. 
Effective September 1, Peter Oleksiak has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance, and he'll have responsibility for the controller's organization and treasury, which includes Investor Relations. Nick, who has been our Treasurer for over 11 years now, will assume the role of Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And Dan Brudzynski, who is currently in the regulatory role will replace Nick as Vice President and Treasurer, and Dan will also have Investor Relations reporting to him. So Nick and Dan are effectively trading places. 
With these changes, this marks the last quarterly earnings call for Nick in the Treasurer's office and I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to Nick for the passion and expertise he's brought to the Treasury group and the important role that he's played in working with the management team, the Board of Directors and the financial community to help DTE Energy achieve some great successes over these years, including pulling through some of the toughest economic times like 2008 and '09 that hopefully, we will ever see in our life. 
Many of you have met Dan, and he's been involved in a number of Investor Relation events over the years, and you can look forward to seeing him going forward. And finally, congratulations to Peter on his well-deserved promotion. And you're not going to lose sight of Nick. He's only 50 feet from my office and he's going to continue to be involved with the investment and credit community. 
So turning to Page 4. This morning, we're going to cover our second quarter results and give you an update on some growth projects at our utilities and the nonutilities. So let me kick this off then on Slide 5. We like to ground all of our discussions with investors in what we call our investment thesis, as we believe this concisely summarizes the compelling reasons to invest in DTE Energy. 
We have a disciplined growth plan that'll provide a 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share. And when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is underpinned by one of our key priorities and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Both utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacement work and a program to move gas meters that are currently inside customers' homes to outside customers' homes. 
We have a constructive regulatory structure in Michigan, which is supported by a solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we know it's our responsibility to earn this construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost and we are very focused on minimizing rate increases to our customers and providing our customers with a great level of service they deserve. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly in the Power & Industrial group and the Gas Storage & Pipelines. And I have some updates that I'll share with you this morning on those businesses. 
So if you'll turn to Page 6. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Our operating earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.86 compared with $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. Like much of the Midwest, the summer here in Michigan is off to a warmer-than-normal start, and actually we're on a track to possibly one of the warmest summers on record. And that translates into strong earnings at Detroit Edison. 
As a reminder, Detroit Edison was decoupled for weather during the second quarter of 2011. So if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year analysis, the warm weather last year didn't flow through to the bottom line. 
Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over the second quarter of last year and that's driven by the REF business line that's ramping up. And tough market conditions made it difficult for Energy Trading to generate margin in the second quarter. Peter will take you through some of the details on the quarter in a few minutes. 
So with the first half of the year behind us, I am reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share. As I will describe later, I'm confident of the midpoint of $3.80 and we could deliver higher than midpoint earnings, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. 
In June, our board approved the 5.5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.48 beginning in October. This gives us a compounded annualized dividend growth rate of 5% over the last 3 years and demonstrates our board and our management team's confidence in our long-term growth plan. The balance sheet remained strong and we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first half of the year. 
In June of this year, Detroit Edison raised $500 million of 10- and 30-years secured debt at the lowest rates in the company's history. The proceeds from that debt offering will be used primarily to refinance higher cost debt, which is maturing or is callable later this year. 
On another topic, we have also been very clear about our strategy to exit the E&P business by selling our assets in the Barnett Shale. And we started talking to you last year about the shale formation called Marble Falls, which is just above the Barnett formation. DTE has been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich play. As we prove up the acreage, we've had moved way up the learning curve and that we're now seeing top-tier returns from our vertical wells there. 
We recently concluded a study that shows a 50% increase in our total reserves over 2011, including 114% increase in the crude oil reserves. And you'll find additional details on the Barnett Marble Falls assets in the Appendix on Slide 22 and 23. We intend to go to market with these assets later this year and we will keep you posted on our progress. And EEI is going to be a good time to give you an update on this and some of the other things that we have underway. 
Shifting to areas of growth for the company. In the second quarter, our Gratiot County wind park became fully operational. This is the largest wind farm in the state of Michigan, with 212 megawatts of generating capacity. Construction is underway on our 110-megawatt thumb wind parks, which includes 3 sites in Huron and Sanilac Counties. And in addition to those 2 projects, we recently announced another 110-megawatt wind development in Huron County, which will be constructed in 2013. All of these projects demonstrate the significant progress we're making in achieving the 10% renewable energy standard in Michigan by 2015, which we think is a good standard and a sensible approach to approaching renewable energy. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we're very excited about the growth potential surrounding the Gas Midstream assets we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major project that we've been talking to you about is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system. And that project's moving along nicely. The anchor tenant on the project has been seeing some very positive results in their drilling, so we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that we have in this area. As we work our way through the final stages of the right-of-away and permitting process and then move into the construction phases, we're still targeting the pipeline to go in service in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the P&I segment, we're pleased with the performance and throughput at the 5 sited REF reduced emission fuel machines, and we're making good progress inside in the remaining 4 machines. In fact, the first of the 4 is being relocated as we speak and should be up and running in the third quarter. We also have completed negotiations with the host utility on the second of the 4 machines that will be relocated, and we expect to finalize agreements and begin moving that machine soon. And we're engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the last 2 machines. So our relocation process is on track and the goal is to have all of the REF machines sited and operational by the end of the year, which will provide a nice earnings bump in that segment for 2013. 
And for some new news in the P&I segment, we've shown you the forward projection goals that we're pursuing for this business, where we want to drive the earnings for $50 million this year to $125 million by 2016. And the step that we made is an acquisition of an on-site business line that we recently agreed to purchase from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. So this is a portfolio of on-site energy projects. These projects are primarily located in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions and they provide on-site utility and energy services. They're very similar to our existing on-site projects, and they represent assets and equipment and technologies that we have extensive experience in. This acquisition will effectively double the size of our on-site business and expands our customer base broader into the Midwest. We target returns on these contracted services that are above our utility returns. And in addition to that, we get very good strong cash flows. 
So we see these projects making a significant contribution towards our goal of growing the P&I segment to $125 million in operating earnings by 2016. The acquisition will be funded by the parent, off our balance sheet by the end -- the exact details of the funding requirements and timing has not yet been determined. And the deal is not closed yet, it will close later this fall. So we still anticipate that we'll stay within our balance sheet targets even with this acquisition. And we do not see the need to raise equity beyond the $300 million requirement that we've communicated to you in 2012. 
Turning to Page 7, and talk a little bit about guidance. With half the year behind us, we remain committed to our full year 2012 earnings guidance. Detroit Edison came into the year with a plan that targeted that's authorized return on equity. And with warmer-than-normal weather we're experiencing during the second quarter and then through the month of July, we now expect to see Detroit Edison come in above the upper end of the guidance range. Some of the July's weather favorability will be offset by increased storm cost as a result of significant storm activity we experienced in the beginning of the month. 
While Detroit Edison has benefited from weather this year, MichCon continues to dig out of the hole created by the extremely mild winter. Quite frankly, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach the low end of guidance for the year. But with continuous improvement work that we're doing and onetime cost actions, we think the bottom ends of the range is achievable. With some revenue opportunities at Gas Storage & Pipelines, we expect them to be at the upper end of the guidance range, which will help offset some of the challenges of MichCon. And we continue to ramp up the REF business line and what we see is the P&I segment is going to end towards -- near the top end of the guidance range for the year. 
Energy Trading. I had already mentioned, Energy Trading turned in modest results for the quarter and it's still not at the level we would like to see. So for the year, we're signaling that Energy Trading will likely not reach the lower end of its guidance range. And due to the shape of the roll on that we would see for the rest of the year -- the remaining profits that we would see for the remainder of the year, a good portion of that's going to be back-end loaded and will show up in the fourth quarter. 
And finally, we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, driven mainly by lower interest rates from the refinancing that we've been actively doing. So in total, we are committed to our original operating earnings guidance range of $3.65 to $3.95 and the favorable weather continues that we've been seeing at Detroit Edison, we could be above the midpoint of that range. 
Before I hand it over to Peter, I would like to give you an update on the regulatory item that we discussed in the first quarter. As you may recall, back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC had exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of the first quarter, Edison had accrued $127 million as a regulatory liability related to the pilot revenue decoupling, and this predominantly represented weather in prior years. 
The MPSC has until Monday to appeal that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. And we won't know until then what the commission will or won't do. If the commission appeals the decision, there could be some time before we learn of the Supreme Court even will hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that it could take months to years before it's completed. 
On the other hand if the MPSC doesn't appeal, we will propose an alternative to the commission that will support our regulatory strategy for Detroit Edison. Our goal is to minimize rate increases to customers, while achieving our financial objectives. That said, the $127 million could be a key component of a plan to potentially push the need for base rate increases at Detroit Edison out to 2015. 
So with that overview, let me pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically i",845,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter, came in at $0.02 of income, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.17. The driver for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.10. Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.02 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.07 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and the summary of our quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $35 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings were $127 million, up $27 million from the prior year. 
We have provided a quarter-over-quarter walk in the Appendix in Detroit Edison for reference, but the message was pretty straightforward. The favorability is primarily driven by warmer weather in the second quarter of 2012, paired with the elimination of the revenue decoupling mechanism. 
In addition, Detroit Edison's renewable investments provided incremental earnings as we continue to execute our investment plan there. 
July is also shaping up to be a strong weather-driven load month. Although as Dave pointed out, we have experienced increased storm restoration expenses, which are likely to offset the portion of the improved margin. 
Summer through mid-July, we had, just to give you just a few stats, we have had 23 days at/or above 90, normal is 12. And actually, of those, we have 4 of those days we're above 100 degrees. And as Dave mentioned in the guidance update, we are anticipating an overall uplift from weather in the third quarter if the summer holds out. 
Putting weather aside, I know a number of you are interested in terms of what's happening with our underlying load in the economy. So I want to give you a brief update. Temperature normalized electric load in the territory. When you look at it at a year-to-date, temperature taken out the impact of weather is relatively flat. As a reminder, we had a pretty nice bounce back in sales after the 2008 and '09 economic downturn. And we have seen a 21% increase in sales alone since 2009. 
We are continuing to see a trend of growth in industrial sales. And actually year-to-date in the service territory, it's a 2% increase, really attributed to auto and other related manufacturing production. For the residential and commercial classes, we are seeing very positive results in our energy efficiency programs, which have lowered the absolute load in both those classes year-over-year. 
For the year, we expect this flat load trend to continue, with continued energy efficiency savings offsetting territory growth. In the longer term, we're anticipating load increases close to 1% after the energy efficiency savings. 
Getting back to the earnings. Moving down the table, our MichCon segment had operating income of $4 million, up $7 million from the prior year. The favorable earnings were driven mainly by an accounting true-up after the completion of the initial reconciliation of MichCon's revenue decoupling mechanism. MichCon also experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter that partially offset this benefit. 
Our non-utility segments were nearly flat year-over-year at $29 million earnings in the quarter. Gas Storage & Pipelines is up $3 million, resulting for stronger transport and storage revenues. Power & Industrial projects is up $5 million due to REF project growth, partially offset by lower coke sales, volume and price. Energy Trading is down $8 million in the quarter due to commodity price environment that provided a lower-than-historical number of opportunities. 
In Appendix Slide 24, you'll see that our standard operating earnings to net -- economic net income walk. In this walk, you will see that the segment did have economic contributions significantly higher than the operating income. Now this difference represents restructuring of some longer-term contracts that will not realize net accounting benefit for a few years out. 
As David mentioned, we expect that our full year earnings for trading will likely be below the guidance range of $30 million to $50 million if the commodity environment we have experienced in the first half of the year continues through the second half. For the second half of the year, we do expect 
Energy Trading and earnings to be back-end loaded, with about $10 million of after tax benefit coming in the fourth quarter due to roll on of earnings related to prior year's full requirement deals, with minimum roll on and earnings expended in the third quarter. Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $2 million from last year due to lower interest, partially offset by higher taxes in 2012. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, the last time in an earnings call, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always and one last time, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains the key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first half of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 12 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. 
In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies, so far this year, including an upgrade of Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to issue $300 million of new equity in 2012, through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. 
As Dave mentioned, DTE has been able to take advantage of historically low interest rate environment. During the last 18 months, we have issued or refinanced nearly $2 billion of long-term debt. Finally, liquidity remained strong, with over $1.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. 
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow so far this year, versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.2 billion matched last year's level and we are well on our way towards full year target of $1.9 billion. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million in the first 6 months of 2012. 
Page 14 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital DTE is up about $100 million or 13% from the prior year. We expect increased levels of capital spending in the second half of the year and are on track to hit the prior forecast of $1.9 billion for all of 2012. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our businesses. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

The results for the first half of the year are solid and on track, and I'm pleased with where we are. And that's why I'm confident reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 a share. 
As you heard, weather is affecting 2000 (sic) [ 2012 ] earnings at both utilities, MichCon to the negative and Detroit Edison to the positive. On a temperature normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized return on equity. But it's still too early for us to remix the guidance for the year, but the weather-driven favorability looks like it will offset any miss at Energy Trading. And that the weather also, if it continues as we've indicated, could push us above the $3.80 midpoint on our full year earnings per share guidance. 
Long term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated investments at the utilities and we're seeing very nice growth potential at our non-utility businesses, and they combine together to provide long-term growth of 5% to 6% earnings per share. And as we've said, and we will always say, we do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow metrics. 
Over the last 3 years, we've increased the annualized dividend 5% on a compounded basis. And as we continue to achieve our long-term earnings per share growth, we expect the dividend will continue to grow as well. 
We'll be back on the road at the end of the summer and we'll likely see many of you at either the Barclays or the Banc of America Conference in New York in September. And with that, Evelyn, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

So really the heating load impact that we saw in the first quarter was partially offset with the cooling demand that we saw on the second quarter. But some of that just reflects on the weather we had last year. Last year we had a good winter also, as well as a relatively warm second quarter. But when you look at, even for the year for residential, when you look on a pure temperature normal basis year-to-date actually we're above. So we're seeing positive impact at a comparative basis, the temperature normal, but a decline year-over-year given the strength of the weather last year.

Turning to Slide 3, with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President of Finance; and Dan Brudzynski, who is our recently appointed Vice President and Treasurer. And as you recall, Dan was the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and before that, Controller and now is back to in finance in the treasury role. And then Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
Now turning to Slide 4. This morning, we're going to cover our third quarter results and give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of this year. We'll also be EEI, which is a little over 2 weeks away, where we will provide additional details in our growth plans. 
So turning to Slide 5. Our investment piece summarizes how we think about growing the business and delivering value to our shareholders. We have a disciplined plan that provides 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And if you combine that with our current annualized dividend of $2.48 per share, we delivered total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. 
And as always, this is all underpinned with one of our key priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have solid growth plans in both of our utilities. At Detroit Edison, that growth primarily by our environment environmental mandates in the form of mission controls and renewable energy. 
And then MichCon growth is driven by infrastructure investments including and main replacements and a program to move gas meters outside of customer zones. Here in Michigan, our utilities operated in a constructive regulatory environment which is supported by solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we believe our responsibility is to earn that construct every day. We utilized our continuous improvement, capabilities in everything we do to control cost, to minimize rate increases and to improve the quality of service that we provide to our customers. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we continue to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in our Gas Storage & Pipelines segments and the Power & Industrial businesses. 
Turning to Slide 6, it's an overview for the quarter. Our operating earnings for the third quarter came in $1.31 per share compared to $1.07 per share in the third quarter of last year. In the 3 quarters of the year now behind us, including the summer cooling season at Detroit Edison, we're confident in narrowing the earnings guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share. And at the same time, increasing the midpoint by a dime to $3.90. 
Like much of the Midwest, the last 2 summers here in Michigan were warmer than normal. But during the third quarter of last year, the revenue decoupler at Detroit Edison has covered weather so we didn't see the earnings benefit last year. Now that the elimination of the decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison in April of this year, we see the impact of this summer's warm weather flowing into the bottom line. 
MichCon, which typically has an operating loss in the third quarter, saw a benefit of higher transportation and storage revenue, along with lower O&M cost, and this resulted in a small operating income for the quarter. Earnings at the Power & Industrial Projects were up over third quarter of last year as the REF business line continues to ramp up. And the combination of the unique trading opportunities in last year's third quarter and a tough market condition this year resulted in lower quarter-over-quarter earnings at Energy Trading. 
Peter will take you through additional details in the third quarter results for each business lines in a few minutes. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations through the third quarter of the year. In fact, the results and the strong cash performance are coming out so strong that we are increasing our cash flow guidance for 2012, and Dan will take you through both cash flows and capital spending in greater detail in a few slides. 
We have been talking to you about our intent to the E&P business. And late last year, we laid out our plan to prove up a oil formation in the Barnett acreage referred to as the Marble Falls. We have been a front-runner in this new really formation which is located just above the Barnett Shale. We completed our drilling plan for the year, and we're making good progress towards full monetization of these assets. We opened our data room in early September and the bids are due at the end of this week, so we'll be able to keep you posted on our progress and give you an update at EEI in a couple of weeks. 
Now if I can shift to the growth areas of the company. We're making substantial investments from renewable energy at Detroit Edison. If you look at the wind generation that we have already online and the investments that we're making including the PPAs that are underway, now we will soon have 700 megawatts renewable energy capacity. This is nearly 8.5% which is well on our way to meeting the renewable energy standard at Michigan, which is 10% by 2015, which we believe is a good standard and the sensible approach to renewable energy in Michigan. 
On the non-utility side of the business, we're excited about the growth potential surrounding both the Gas Midstream assets that we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major growth project is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system, and that's moving along nicely. We've secured all the permits and right aways and construction is underway as we speak. We expect to have a lateral pipe in service by the end of the year. And additionally, the gathering system will support our anchor tenant, Southwestern Energy, as they continue to draw wells ahead of bilateral being put in service. 
More recently, we announced a new proposed pipeline in the Utica Shale. This pipe would be developed jointly with Enbridge and Spectra to move gas from the Utica Shale to markets in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario, Canada. This would originate in Northeast Ohio and travel into Michigan and will interconnect with the Vector Pipeline, which provides access also into Ontario. It would be a 250-mile large diameter pipe and capable of moving at least 1 Bcf of gas a day. The initial investment is estimated to be $1.5 billion share would be 1/3 or $500 million. 
But currently, running at open season on this proposed pipe that would run through the end of the member. And we would work with this interested parties to binding agreements in the first half of next year. And if the timing goes as planned, the pipe will go into service in early 2016. We expect these new projects to provide substantial growth in earnings and help take the Gas Storage & Pipelines business from $60 million in earnings this year to $100 million in earnings by 2015. 
In the P&I segment, we're seeing good operational performance and throughput at our 5 site REF machines. If you remember, there is 9 in total and we're making good progress inside of the remaining 4. In fact, 1 of the 4 began commercial operations at a non-DTE site earlier this week, and we've executed agreements with another utility to relocated a unit at 1 of their sties. We're also engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the remainder 2 machines, so we're making good progress there. 
On earnings call last quarter, I announced that we were acquiring a portfolio of on-site energy projects from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. As of last week, we closed on 12 of the 14 projects and expect to close on the remaining 2 sometime next month. 
Going forward, we see these projects contributing to our growth aspiration for the Power & Industrial projects from $50 million in earnings this year to $125 million by 2016. 
Now if we can turn to Page 7. I'd like to shift gears and give you an update on some developments on the regulatory front. MichCon is in the midst of a original rate case that was filed in April. At the end of September, we filed testimony with the Michigan Public Service Commission to self implement up to $34 million beginning in November. This case will continue to play out over the next several months with a final decision no later than April of next year. 
At at Detroit Edison, we were successful in reaching the constructive outcome related to the termination of the revenue decoupling mechanism and the related $127 million regulatory liability. As you might recall, back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision at the PMC order Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. Through the first quarter of 2012, Detroit Edison had accrued $127 million liability related to the pilot RDM, which represents hot weather primarily in prior years, 2010 and 2011. Rather than taking the full $127 million into the Court of Appeals decision, we filed an accounting application seeking authority to amortize that amount into income in 2014. The accounting treatment combined with other cost saving actions would help offset the need for new rates in 2014, and is a key component of our plan to potential push out the need for base rate increases until 2015. On September 25, the issue an order granting our request. 
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on our 2012 earnings guidance. The 3 quarters of the year behind us, including a warmer than normal summer, we're confident in narrowing and raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. At Detroit Edison, the weather favorability not only allows us to increase earnings guidance, but also provide an opportunity for us to reinvest in our electric systems to improve the distribution system and power plant reliability. This includes things like line clearance and preventive maintenance in the distribution system, power plants in our vehicle fleet. The outlook for MichCon has improved as well. You may recall that the unusually warm winter created quite a hole in MichCon in the first quarter, and we began signaling to work really hard to hit even the bottom end of the range of the guidance. As a result of some one-time cost reduction actions that the team implemented, we're confident in reaffirming MichCon's earning guidance of $110 million to $115 million. 
The storage and transportation revenue at the Gas Storage & Pipelines segments are coming in strong, pushing guidance for this segment to a point estimate now of $60 million. 
Finally, Energy Trading continues to see fewer opportunities in a challenging and choppy market. So from where we stand now, we think the guidance range of $10 million to $25 million is appropriate, which includes approximately $10 million of after-tax roll on that we expect to show up in the fourth quarter. So in total, we're confident and raising the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance to $3.90 with the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Peter, who will take us some additional details in the quarter."

The non-utility segments combined earned $0.22. The drivers to the non-utility second quarter results were Power & Industrial at $0.13, Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.08, Energy Trading at $0.01 and finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11 as a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy were up $44 million in the quarter or $0.24 per share. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was at $194 million, up $37 million for the prior year. The favorable year-over-year performance was driven by warmer than normal weather flowing this year though earnings. 
Last year, our revenue decoupling mechanism was in effect which temperature normalized revenues. As we continue to see stability in underlying load at our electric segment with temperature normalized sales flat in the quarter net of 1% impact of energy efficiency program reduction. Specific industrial sales continue to grow, up 3% year-to-date. 
As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically loss for seasonal gas utility business. Our MichCon had an operating gain of $4 million for the quarter, up $15 million from prior year. The improvement in earnings is driven by higher transportation and storage service revenues along with lower gas expense in the quarter and lower O&M. This quarter is a clear demonstration of a continued improvements efforts are paying off at MichCon. For example, the improvement of gas expense quarter is a direct result of improvement in reducing fiscal losses through a series of operational improvements and system and interconnect, improvements in metering technology and a step up of distribution reliability and investment. 
Our non-utility segments are down $8 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings than the 3 other segments. Energy Trading is down $21 million in this quarter year-over-year. The year-over-year results are driven by a combination of a stronger than normal third quarter 2011 and a larger portion of this year's economic performance is subject to an accounting timing. For your reference, we provided our year-to-date economic accounting earnings loss for the segment in the appendix, which shows the economic earnings in '12 versus '11. 
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance was Power & Industrial projects segment, which was up $10 million. This was driven primarily by the growth in our REF business line. Unconventional Gas Production improved earnings $2 million, breaking even in the quarter. The improvement was driven by a higher oil production. Our production is up 97% year-over-year. 
As Dave mentioned, we are in the final strokes of a targeted year end sales process for those properties. Finally, Gas Storage & Pipelines segment was up $1 million for the quarter to $14 million and like MichCon, benefit from higher storage and transportation revenues. That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. Now I'll turn discussion to our Treasurer, Dan Brudzynski who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE, and I look forward to working closely with all of you on this call in the future. 
As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri, our commitment to cash flow and prudent balance sheet management remains a strong as ever. Now turning to Slide 13 and year-to-date cash flow and capital spending. 2012 cash flows are up, driven by increased cash recovery at the utilities, primarily related to the PSCR and the tri-striker regulatory recovery mechanisms in 2012 and an early 2011 cash pension contribution. This is slightly offset for the year by higher corporate cash payments. Capital spending is slightly higher in 2012 due to our investments in the Bluestone pipeline as Dave mentioned and higher base operating capital at the utilities come a slightly offset by some lower renewables in investment, a reminder the 2011 includes some large investments in our Grash Wind Park which has since been placed into service. 
Then moving onto Slide 14 and the outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for cash from operations to $2.2 billion, driven by warm summer weather. Again, we plan for the year at weather normal levels, and the impact of the RDM court ruling at Detroit Edison. Our original guidance at the beginning of the year assume the decoupling balances we have begun to be funded the customers this year. And as Dave mentioned earlier, the RDM amortizations will begin in 2014. In addition, Kash at our non-utility businesses is also expected to be higher in 2012. Capital spending is good projected the buyer also. You'll see that the Delta through the right of the slide where non-utility's that business are up as a result of the acquisition of it on-site energy project portfolio from Duke energy within our Power & Industrial group this October. We also anticipate a slight remixing of CapEx at Detroit Edison but still yielding roughly a total of $1.2 billion. 
And finally, finishing up with a look at the balance sheet in our credit metrics on Slide 15. Leverage in total debt remained well within our targeted ranges, liquidity is strong and our rating agency outlooks are positive. We've issued $160 million in equity year-to-date into our pension and benefit program for the year. 
And now for the third quarter wrap up, it's back over to, you Dave."

As we laid out for you, the results of the first 3 quarters are very solid. With the benefit our favorable summer weather, we're able to reinvest in our electric generation system and confidently raise the midpoint of our earnings guidance per share by $0.01. Setting aside the unusual weather this year which is providing upside at Detroit Edison and pressure at MichCon and a temperature normal basis both utilities are on track to earn their authorized returns. Longer term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated environmental-related investments, and we're also seeing nice growth opportunities at the non-utility businesses. When you put this altogether, they combined to provide an overall long-term earnings growth per share of 5% to 6%. 
And as we indicated, we always do this by maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash flows. We'll be at EEI in a little over 2 weeks, as I mentioned, and we hope to get a chance to see many of you there. For those of you not going to EEI, you can tune into Gary Anderson's presentation via the webcast, Tuesday morning, which is at 9:45 a.m. Mountain time, and that's 11:45 a.m. for those of you in the Eastern time zone, and you'll be able to join our webcast or our Investors Section in our websites.

And just to start off here, welcome to our third quarter call. And as we're getting started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of the document, including the reference to our forward-looking statements. 
Turning to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and Dan Brudzynski, who is our recently appointed Vice President and Treasurer. And if you recall, Dan was the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and before that, Controller, and now is back in finance in the treasury role. And then Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
Now turning to Slide 4. This morning, we're going to cover our third quarter results and give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of this year. We'll also be at EEI, which is a little over 2 weeks away, where we will provide additional details in our growth plans. 
So let's turn to Slide 5. Our investment thesis summarizes how we think about growing the business and delivering value to our shareholders. We have a disciplined plan that provides 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And if you combine that with our current annualized dividend of $2.48 per share, we delivered total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. And as always, this is all underpinned with one of our key priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We have solid growth plans at both of our utilities. At Detroit Edison, that growth is driven primarily by environmental mandates in the form of mission controls and renewable energy. And at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacements and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. 
Here in Michigan, our utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment, which is supported by solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we believe our responsibility is to earn that construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost, to minimize rate increases and to improve the quality of service that we provide to our customers. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we continue to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment and the Power & Industrial businesses. 
Turning to Slide 6, is an overview for the quarter. Our operating earnings for the third quarter came in at $1.31 per share compared to $1.07 per share in the third quarter of last year. The 3 quarters of the year is now behind us, including the summer cooling season at Detroit Edison, we're confident in narrowing the earnings guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share. And at the same time, increasing the midpoint by $0.10 to $3.90. 
Like much of the Midwest, the last 2 summers here in Michigan were warmer than normal. But during the third quarter of last year, the revenue decoupler at Detroit Edison covered weather, so we didn't see the earnings benefit last year. Now that the elimination of the decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison in April of this year, we see the impact of this summer's warm weather flowing to the bottom line. 
MichCon, which typically has an operating loss in the third quarter, saw the benefit of higher transportation and storage revenue, along with lower O&M cost. And this resulted in a small operating income for the quarter. Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over third quarter of last year as the REF business line continues to ramp up. And the combination of some unique trading opportunities in last year's third quarter and a tough market condition this year resulted in lower quarter-over-quarter earnings at Energy Trading. 
Peter will take you through additional details in the third quarter results for each business line in a few minutes. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations through the third quarter of the year. In fact, the results and the strong cash performance are coming out so strong that we are increasing our cash flow guidance for 2012. And Dan will take you through both cash flows and capital spending in greater detail in a few slides. 
We have been talking to you about our intent to exit the E&P business. And late last year, we laid out our plan to prove up an oil formation in the Barnett acreage, referred to as the Marble Falls. We have been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich formation, which is located just above the Barnett Shale. We completed our drilling plan for the year, and we're making good progress towards full monetization of these assets. We opened our data room in early September and the bids are due at the end of this week. So we'll be able to keep you posted on our progress and give you an update at EEI in a couple of weeks. 
Now if I can shift to the growth areas of the company. We're making substantial investments from renewable energy at Detroit Edison. If you look at the wind generation that we already have online and the investments that we're making, including the PPAs that are underway, now we will soon have 700 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. This is nearly 8.5%, which is well on our way to meeting the renewable energy standard at Michigan, which is 10% by 2015, which we believe is a good standard and a sensible approach to renewable energy in Michigan. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we're excited about the growth potential surrounding both the Gas Midstream assets that we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major growth project is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system, and that's moving along nicely. We've secured all the permits and right-of-ways and construction is underway as we speak. We expect to have a lateral pipe in service by the end of the year. And additionally, the gathering system will support our anchor tenant, Southwestern Energy, as they continue to draw wells ahead of that lateral being put in service. 
More recently, we announced a new proposed pipeline in the Utica Shale. This pipe would be developed jointly with Enbridge and Spectra to move gas from the Utica Shale to markets in Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. This would originate in Northeast Ohio and travel into Michigan, where it would interconnect with the Vector Pipeline, which provides access also into Ontario. It would be a 250-mile large diameter pipe and capable of moving at least 1 Bcf of gas a day. The initial investment is estimated to be $1.5 billion and our share would be 1/3 or $500 million. 
We're currently running an open season on this proposed pipe and that would run through the end of November. And we'll work with interested parties to establish binding agreements in the first half of next year. And if the timing goes as planned, that pipe would go into service in early 2016. We expect these new projects to provide substantial growth in earnings and help take the Gas Storage & Pipelines business from $60 million in earnings this year to $100 million in earnings by 2015. 
In the P&I segment, we're seeing good operational performance and throughput at our 5 sited REF machines. If you remember, there's 9 in total. And we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4. In fact, 1 of the 4 began commercial operations at a non-DTE site earlier this week. And we've executed agreements with another utility to relocated a unit at one of their sites. We're also engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the remaining 2 machines. So we're making good progress there. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I announced that we were acquiring a portfolio of on-site energy projects from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. As of last week, we closed on 12 of the 14 projects and expect to close on the remaining 2 sometime next month. Going forward, we see these projects contributing to our growth aspiration for the Power & Industrial projects from $50 million in earnings this year to $125 million by 2016. 
Now if we can turn to Page 7. I'd like to shift gears and give you an update on some developments on the regulatory front. MichCon is in the midst of a general rate case that was filed in April. At the end of September, we filed testimony with the Michigan Public Service Commission to self-implement up to $34 million beginning in November. This case will continue to play out over the next several months with a final decision no later than April of next year. 
At Detroit Edison, we were successful in reaching a constructive outcome related to the termination of the revenue decoupling mechanism and the related $127 million regulatory liability. As you might recall back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it ordered Detroit Edison to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism. Through the first quarter of 2012, Detroit Edison had accrued $127 million liability related to the pilot RDM, which represents hot weather, primarily in prior years, 2010 and 2011. 
Rather than taking the full $127 million into income upon the Court of Appeals decision, we filed an accounting application seeking authority to amortize that amount into income in 2014. The accounting treatment combined with other cost-saving actions would help offset the need for new rates in 2014 and is a key component of our plan to potentially push out the need for base rate increases until 2015. On September 25, the MPSC issued an order granting our request. 
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on our 2012 earnings guidance. The 3 quarters of the year behind us, including a warmer-than-normal summer, we're confident in narrowing and raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. At Detroit Edison, the weather favorability not only allows us to increase the earnings guidance but also provide an opportunity for us to reinvest in our electric systems to improve the distribution system and power plant reliability. This includes things like line clearance and preventative maintenance to the distribution systems, power plants and our vehicle fleet. 
The outlook for MichCon has improved as well. You may recall that the unusually warm winter created quite a hole in MichCon in the first quarter. And we began signaling that they'd have to work really hard to hit even the bottom end of the range of their guidance. As a result of some one-time cost reduction actions that the team implemented, we're confident in reaffirming MichCon's earning guidance of $110 million to $115 million. The storage and transportation revenue at the Gas Storage & Pipelines segments are coming in strong, pushing guidance for this segment to a point estimate now of $60 million. 
Finally, Energy Trading continues to see fewer opportunities in a challenging and choppy market. So from where we stand now, we think the guidance range of $10 million to $25 million is appropriate, which includes approximately $10 million of after-tax roll-on that we expect to show up in the fourth quarter. So in total, we're confident in raising the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance to $3.90 with the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which incurs an operating loss this quar",550,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start on Page 10 and third quarter earnings results for the quarter. DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.31. Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which incurs an operating loss this quarter, actually came in $0.02 positive income. And I'll talk about more of that coming up. 
The nonutility segments combined to earn $0.22. The drivers to the nonutility second quarter results were Power & Industrial at $0.13; Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.08; Energy Trading at $0.01; and finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11 as summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy were up $44 million in the quarter or $0.24 per share. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was at $194 million, up $37 million from the prior year. The favorable year-over-year performance was driven by warmer-than-normal weather flowing this year through earnings. 
Last year, a revenue decoupling mechanism was in effect, which temperature-normalized revenues. Now we continue to see stability in underlying load at our electric segment with temperature-normalized sales flat in the quarter net of a 1% impact of energy efficiency program reductions. Service territory industrial sales continued to grow, up 3% year-to-date. 
As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for our seasonal gas utility business. However, MichCon had an operating gain of $4 million for the quarter, up $15 million from prior year. The improvement to earnings is driven by higher transportation and storage service revenues along with lower lost gas expense in the quarter and lower O&M. This quarter is a clear demonstration that our continuous improvement efforts are paying off at MichCon. For example, the improvement in lost gas expense this quarter is a direct result of improvements in reducing fiscal losses through a series of operational improvements in system and in interconnects, improvements in metering technology and a step-up in distribution reliability investments. 
Our nonutility segments are down $8 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings at the 3 other segments. Energy Trading is down $21 million in this quarter year-over-year. The year-over-year results are driven by a combination of a stronger-than-normal third quarter 2011. And a larger portion of this year's economic performance is subject to accounting timing. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accounting earnings loss [ph] for this segment in the appendix, which shows the economic earnings in '12 versus '11.  
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is Power & Industrial project segment, which was up $10 million. This is driven primarily by the growth in our REF business line. Unconventional Gas Production improved earnings $2 million, breaking even in the quarter. The improvement was driven by higher oil production. Our production is up actually 97% year-over-year. As Dave mentioned, we are in the final strokes of a targeted year-end sales process for those properties. Finally, Gas Storage & Pipelines segment was up $1 million for the quarter to $14 million, and like MichCon, benefit from higher storage and transportation revenues. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to our Treasurer, Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri",408,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri, our commitment to cash flow and prudent balance sheet management remains a strong as ever. 
Now turning to Slide 13 and year-to-date cash flow and capital spending. 2012 cash flows are up, driven by increased cash recovery at the utilities, primarily related to the PSCR and the choice tracker regulatory recovery mechanisms in 2012 and an early 2011 cash pension contribution. This is slightly offset for the year by higher corporate tax payments. Capital spending is slightly higher in 2012 due to our investments in the Bluestone pipeline, as David mentioned, and higher base operating capital at the utilities, slightly offset by some lower renewables investment, a reminder that 2011 includes some large investments in our Gratiot wind park, which has since been placed into service. 
Then moving onto Slide 14 and the outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for cash from operations to $2.2 billion, driven by warm summer weather, again we plan for the year at weather-normal levels, and the impact of the RDM court ruling at Detroit Edison. Our original guidance at the beginning of the year assumed the decoupling balances we had begun to be refunded to customers this year. And as Dave mentioned earlier, the RDM amortization will begin in 2014. 
In addition, cash at our nonutility businesses is also expected to be higher in 2012. Capital spending is projected to be higher also. You'll see that detail to the right on the slide, where nonutility investments are up as a result of the acquisition of the on-site energy project portfolio from Duke Energy within our Power & Industrial group this October. We also anticipate a slight remixing of CapEx at Detroit Edison but still yielding roughly a total of $1.2 billion. 
And finally, finishing up with a look at the balance sheet and our credit metrics on Slide 15. Leverage and FFO to debt remained well within our targeted ranges. Liquidity is strong and our rating agency outlooks are positive. We've issued $160 million in equity year-to-date into our pension and benefit program for the year. 
And now for the third quarter wrap-up, it's back over to you, Dave."

As we laid out for you, the results through the first 3 quarters are very solid. With a benefit of favorable summer weather, we're able to reinvest in our electric generation distribution systems and confidently raise the midpoint of our earnings guidance per share by $0.10. Setting aside the unusual weather this year, which is providing upside at Detroit Edison and pressure at MichCon, on a temperature-normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized returns. 
Longer term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated environmental-related investments and we're also seeing nice growth opportunities at the nonutility businesses. When you put this altogether, they combine to provide an overall long-term earnings growth per share of 5% to 6%. And as we indicated, we always do this by maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash flows. 
We'll be at EEI in a little over 2 weeks, as I mentioned, and we hope to get a chance to see many of you there. For those of you not going to EEI, you can tune in to Gerry Anderson's presentation via the webcast, Tuesday morning, which is at 9:45 a.m., Mountain Time. And that's 11:45 a.m. for those of you in the Eastern time zone. And you'll be able to join that webcast through our Investors section on our website.

So for example, at Detroit Edison, where the authorized is 10.5%, we actually have the ability with those other 2 mechanisms to earn 10.6%, as an example. So there will be slightly overearning before that. And I also think that we can work within the bandwidth around authorized.

And just to start off here, welcome to our third quarter call. And as we're getting started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of the document, including the reference to our forward-looking statements. 
Turning to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and Dan Brudzynski, who is our recently appointed Vice President and Treasurer. And if you recall, Dan was the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and before that, Controller, and now is back in finance in the treasury role. And then Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
Now turning to Slide 4. This morning, we're going to cover our third quarter results and give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of this year. We'll also be at EEI, which is a little over 2 weeks away, where we will provide additional details and our growth plans. 
So let's turn to Slide 5. Our investment thesis summarizes how we think about growing the business and delivering value to our shareholders. We have a disciplined plan that provides 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And if you combine that with our current annualized dividend of $2.48 per share, we deliver a total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. And as always, this is all underpinned with one of our key priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We have solid growth plans at both of our utilities. At Detroit Edison, that growth is driven primarily by environmental mandates in the form of mission controls and renewable energy. And at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacements and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. 
Here in Michigan, our utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment, which is supported by solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we believe our responsibility is to earn that construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost, to minimize rate increases and to improve the quality of service that we provide our customers. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we continue to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment and the Power & Industrial businesses. 
Turning to Slide 6, is an overview for the quarter. Our operating earnings for the third quarter came in at $1.31 per share compared to $1.07 per share in the third quarter of last year. And with 3 quarters of the year now behind us, including the summer cooling season at Detroit Edison, we're confident in narrowing the earnings guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share. And at the same time, increasing the midpoint by $0.10 to $3.90. 
Like much of the Midwest, the last 2 summers here in Michigan were warmer than normal. But during the third quarter of last year, the revenue decoupler at Detroit Edison covered weather, so we didn't see the earnings benefit last year. Now that the elimination of the decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison in April of this year, we see the impact of this summer's warm weather flowing to the bottom line. 
MichCon, which typically has an operating loss in the third quarter, saw the benefit of higher transportation and storage revenue, along with lower O&M cost. And this resulted in a small operating income for the quarter. Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over third quarter of last year as the REF business line continues to ramp up. And the combination of some unique trading opportunities in last year's third quarter and a tough market condition this year resulted in lower quarter-over-quarter earnings at Energy Trading. 
Peter will take you through additional details in the third quarter results for each business line in a few minutes. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations through the third quarter of the year. In fact, the results and the strong cash performance are coming out so strong that we are increasing our cash flow guidance for 2012. And Dan will take you through both cash flows and capital spending in greater detail in a few slides. 
We have been talking to you about our intent to exit the E&P business. And late last year, we laid out our plan to prove up an oil formation in the Barnett acreage, referred to as the Marble Falls. We have been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich formation, which is located just above the Barnett Shale. We completed our drilling plan for the year, and we're making good progress towards full monetization of these assets. We opened our data room in early September and the bids are due at the end of this week. So we'll be able to keep you posted on our progress and give you an update at EEI in a couple of weeks. 
Now if I can shift to the growth areas of the company. We're making substantial investments from renewable energy at Detroit Edison. If you look at the wind generation that we already have online and the investments that we're making, including the PPAs that are underway, now we will soon have 700 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. This is nearly 8.5%, which is well on our way to meeting the renewable energy standard at Michigan, which is 10% by 2015, which we believe is a good standard and a sensible approach to renewable energy in Michigan. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we're excited about the growth potential surrounding both the Gas Midstream assets that we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major growth project is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system, and that's moving along nicely. We've secured all the permits and right-of-ways and construction is underway as we speak. We expect to have a lateral pipe in service by the end of the year. And additionally, the gathering system will support our anchor tenant, Southwestern Energy, as they continue to draw wells ahead of that lateral being put in service. 
More recently, we announced a new proposed pipeline in the Utica Shale. This pipe would be developed jointly with Enbridge and Spectra to move gas from the Utica Shale to markets in Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. This would originate in Northeast Ohio and travel into Michigan, where it would interconnect with the Vector Pipeline, which provides access also into Ontario. It would be a 250-mile large diameter pipe and capable of moving at least 1 Bcf of gas a day. The initial investment is estimated to be $1.5 billion and our share would be 1/3 or $500 million. 
We're currently running an open season on this proposed pipe and that would run through the end of November. And we'll work with interested parties to establish binding agreements in the first half of next year. And if the timing goes as planned, that pipe would go into service in early 2016. We expect these new projects to provide substantial growth in earnings and help take the Gas Storage & Pipelines business from $60 million in earnings this year to $100 million in earnings by 2015. 
In the P&I segment, we're seeing good operational performance and throughput at our 5 sited REF machines. If you remember, there's 9 in total. And we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4. In fact, 1 of the 4 began commercial operations at a non-DTE site earlier this week. And we've executed agreements with another utility to relocate a unit at one of their sites. We're also engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the remaining 2 machines. So we're making good progress there. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I announced that we were acquiring a portfolio of on-site energy projects from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. As of last week, we closed on 12 of the 14 projects and expect to close on the remaining 2 sometime next month. Going forward, we see these projects contributing to our growth aspiration for the Power & Industrial projects from $50 million in earnings this year to $125 million by 2016. 
Now if we can turn to Page 7. I'd like to shift gears and give you an update on some developments on the regulatory front. MichCon is in the midst of a general rate case that was filed in April. At the end of September, we filed testimony with the Michigan Public Service Commission to self-implement up to $34 million beginning in November. This case will continue to play out over the next several months with the final decision no later than April of next year. 
At Detroit Edison, we were successful in reaching a constructive outcome related to the termination of the revenue decoupling mechanism and the related $127 million regulatory liability. As you might recall back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it ordered Detroit Edison to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism. Through the first quarter of 2012, Detroit Edison had accrued $127 million liability related to the pilot RDM, which represents hot weather, primarily in prior years, 2010 and 2011. 
Rather than taking the full $127 million into income upon the Court of Appeals decision, we filed an accounting application seeking authority to amortize that amount into income in 2014. The accounting treatment combined with other cost-saving actions would help offset the need for new rates in 2014 and is a key component of our plan to potentially push out the need for base rate increases until 2015. On September 25, the MPSC issued an order granting our request. 
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on our 2012 earnings guidance. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, including a warmer-than-normal summer, we're confident in narrowing and raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. At Detroit Edison, the weather favorability not only allows us to increase the earnings guidance but also provide an opportunity for us to reinvest in our electric systems to improve the distribution system and power plant reliability. This includes things like line clearance and preventative maintenance to the distribution systems, power plants and our vehicle fleet. 
The outlook for MichCon has improved as well. You may recall that the unusually warm winter created quite a hole in MichCon in the first quarter. And we began signaling that they'd have to work really hard to hit even the bottom end of the range of their guidance. As a result of some one-time cost reduction actions that the team implemented, we're confident in reaffirming MichCon's earning guidance of $110 million to $115 million. The storage and transportation revenue at the Gas Storage & Pipelines segments are coming in strong, pushing guidance for this segment to a point estimate now of $60 million. 
Finally, Energy Trading continues to see fewer opportunities in a challenging and choppy market. So from where we stand now, we think the guidance range of $10 million to $25 million is appropriate, which includes approximately $10 million of after-tax roll-on that we expect to show up in the fourth quarter. So in total, we're confident in raising the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance to $3.90 with the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

I'd like to start on Page 10 and third quarter earnings results for the quarter. DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.31. Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss",550,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start on Page 10 and third quarter earnings results for the quarter. DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.31. Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss this quarter, actually came in $0.02 positive income. And I'll talk about more of that coming up. 
The nonutility segments combined to earn $0.22. The drivers to the nonutility second quarter results were Power & Industrial at $0.13; Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.08; Energy Trading at $0.01; and finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11 as summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy were up $44 million in the quarter or $0.24 per share. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was at $194 million, up $37 million from the prior year. The favorable year-over-year performance was driven by warmer-than-normal weather flowing this year through earnings. 
Last year, a revenue decoupling mechanism was in effect, which temperature-normalized revenues. Now we continue to see stability in underlying load at our electric segment with temperature-normalized sales flat in the quarter net of a 1% impact of energy efficiency program reductions. Service territory industrial sales continued to grow, up 3% year-to-date. 
As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for our seasonal gas utility business. However, MichCon had an operating gain of $4 million for the quarter, up $15 million from prior year. The improvement to earnings was driven by higher transportation and storage service revenues along with lower lost gas expense in the quarter and lower O&M. This quarter is a clear demonstration that our continuous improvement efforts are paying off at MichCon. For example, the improvement in lost gas expense this quarter is a direct result of improvements in reducing fiscal losses through a series of operational improvements in system and in interconnects, improvements in metering technology and a step-up in distribution reliability investments. 
Our nonutility segments are down $8 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings at the 3 other segments. Energy Trading is down $21 million in this quarter year-over-year. The year-over-year results are driven by a combination of a stronger-than-normal third quarter 2011. And a larger portion of this year's economic performance is subject to accounting timing. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accounting earnings loss for this segment in the appendix, which shows the economic earnings in '12 versus '11.  
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is Power & Industrial project segment, which was up $10 million. This is driven primarily by the growth in our REF business line. Unconventional Gas Production improved earnings $2 million, breaking even in the quarter. The improvement was driven by higher oil production. Our production is up actually 97% year-over-year. As Dave mentioned, we are in the final strokes of a targeted year-end sales process for those properties. Finally, Gas Storage & Pipelines segment was up $1 million for the quarter to $14 million, and like MichCon, benefit from higher storage and transportation revenues. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to our Treasurer, Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri",409,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri, our commitment to cash flow and prudent balance sheet management remains a strong as ever. 
Now turning to Slide 13 and year-to-date cash flow and capital spending. 2012 cash flows are up, driven by increased cash recovery at the utilities, primarily related to the PSCR and the choice tracker regulatory recovery mechanisms in 2012 and an early 2011 cash pension contribution. This is slightly offset for the year by higher corporate tax payments. Capital spending is slightly higher in 2012 due to our investments in the Bluestone pipeline, as David mentioned, and higher base operating capital at the utilities, slightly offset by some lower renewables investment, a reminder that 2011 includes some large investments in our Gratiot wind park, which has since been placed into service. 
Then moving onto Slide 14 and the outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for cash from operations to $2.2 billion, driven by warm summer weather, again we plan for the year at weather-normal levels, and the impact of the RDM court ruling at Detroit Edison. Our original guidance at the beginning of the year assumed the decoupling balances we have begun to be refunded to customers this year. And as Dave mentioned earlier, the RDM amortization will begin in 2014. 
In addition, cash at our nonutility businesses is also expected to be higher in 2012. Capital spending is projected to be higher also. You'll see that detail to the right on the slide, where nonutility investments are up as a result of the acquisition of the on-site energy project portfolio from Duke Energy within our Power & Industrial group this October. We also anticipate a slight remixing of CapEx at Detroit Edison but still yielding roughly a total of $1.2 billion. 
And finally, finishing up with a look at the balance sheet and our credit metrics on Slide 15. Leverage and FFO to debt remained well within our targeted ranges. Liquidity is strong and our rating agency outlooks are positive. We've issued $160 million in equity year-to-date into our pension and benefit [indiscernible] program for the year. 
And now for the third quarter wrap-up, it's back over to you, Dave."

As we laid out for you, the results through the first 3 quarters are very solid. With a benefit of favorable summer weather, we're able to reinvest in our electric generation distribution systems and confidently raise the midpoint of our earnings guidance per share by $0.10. Setting aside the unusual weather this year, which is providing upside at Detroit Edison and pressure at MichCon, on a temperature-normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized returns. 
Longer term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated environmental-related investments and we're also seeing nice growth opportunities at the nonutility businesses. When you put this altogether, they combine to provide an overall long-term earnings growth per share of 5% to 6%. And as we indicated, we always do this by maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash flows. 
We'll be at EEI in a little over 2 weeks, as I mentioned, and we hope to get a chance to see many of you there.

Actually this time last year, unemployment was 1% higher, so we're seeing a 1% decline on employment. Housing starts is another key indicator, up about 50%, so seeing some strong housing starts. And as you mentioned from the auto sales on an annualized basis, they've recently just come up with their numbers and they're at 14.9 million units. So we really haven't seen those levels probably for 5 to 6 years. So all indications are real strong from an economic indicator. On the residentials, on a year-to-date, temperature-normalized were flat. And typically for that segment, we will see about a 1% to 2% estimate on energy efficiency. So one way to think about it, we have growth, organic growth happening there that's offset by energy efficiency. The other thing that we really monitor from an economic perspective is the industrial. And we are seeing a 3% growth there year-over-year. And we are seeing strength in the autos and the steel segments."

And just to start off here, welcome to our third quarter call. And as we're getting started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of the document, including the reference to our forward-looking statements. 
Turning to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and Dan Brudzynski, who is our recently appointed Vice President and Treasurer. And if you recall, Dan was the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and before that, Controller, and now is back in finance in the treasury role. And then Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. 
Now turning to Slide 4. This morning, we're going to cover our third quarter results and give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of this year. We'll also be at EEI, which is a little over 2 weeks away, where we will provide additional details and our growth plans. 
So let's turn to Slide 5. Our investment thesis summarizes how we think about growing the business and delivering value to our shareholders. We have a disciplined plan that provides 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And if you combine that with our current annualized dividend of $2.48 per share, we deliver a total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. And as always, this is all underpinned with one of our key priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We have solid growth plans at both of our utilities. At Detroit Edison, that growth is driven primarily by environmental mandates in the form of mission controls and renewable energy. And at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacements and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. 
Here in Michigan, our utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment, which is supported by solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we believe our responsibility is to earn that construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost, to minimize rate increases and to improve the quality of service that we provide our customers. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we continue to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment and the Power & Industrial businesses. 
Turning to Slide 6, is an overview for the quarter. Our operating earnings for the third quarter came in at $1.31 per share compared to $1.07 per share in the third quarter of last year. And with 3 quarters of the year now behind us, including the summer cooling season at Detroit Edison, we're confident in narrowing the earnings guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share. And at the same time, increasing the midpoint by $0.10 to $3.90. 
Like much of the Midwest, the last 2 summers here in Michigan were warmer than normal. But during the third quarter of last year, the revenue decoupler at Detroit Edison covered weather, so we didn't see the earnings benefit last year. Now that the elimination of the decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison in April of this year, we see the impact of this summer's warm weather flowing to the bottom line. 
MichCon, which typically has an operating loss in the third quarter, saw the benefit of higher transportation and storage revenue, along with lower O&M cost. And this resulted in a small operating income for the quarter. Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over third quarter of last year as the REF business line continues to ramp up. And the combination of some unique trading opportunities in last year's third quarter and a tough market condition this year resulted in lower quarter-over-quarter earnings at Energy Trading. 
Peter will take you through additional details in the third quarter results for each business line in a few minutes. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations through the third quarter of the year. In fact, the results and the strong cash performance are coming out so strong that we are increasing our cash flow guidance for 2012. And Dan will take you through both cash flows and capital spending in greater detail in a few slides. 
We have been talking to you about our intent to exit the E&P business. And late last year, we laid out our plan to prove up an oil formation in the Barnett acreage, referred to as the Marble Falls. We have been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich formation, which is located just above the Barnett Shale. We completed our drilling plan for the year, and we're making good progress towards full monetization of these assets. We opened our data room in early September and the bids are due at the end of this week. So we'll be able to keep you posted on our progress and give you an update at EEI in a couple of weeks. 
Now if I can shift to the growth areas of the company. We're making substantial investments from renewable energy at Detroit Edison. If you look at the wind generation that we already have online and the investments that we're making, including the PPAs that are underway, now we will soon have 700 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. This is nearly 8.5%, which is well on our way to meeting the renewable energy standard at Michigan, which is 10% by 2015, which we believe is a good standard and a sensible approach to renewable energy in Michigan. 
On the nonutility side of the business, we're excited about the growth potential surrounding both the Gas Midstream assets that we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major growth project is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system, and that's moving along nicely. We've secured all the permits and right-of-ways and construction is underway as we speak. We expect to have a lateral pipe in service by the end of the year. And additionally, the gathering system will support our anchor tenant, Southwestern Energy, as they continue to draw wells ahead of that lateral being put in service. 
More recently, we announced a new proposed pipeline in the Utica Shale. This pipe would be developed jointly with Enbridge and Spectra to move gas from the Utica Shale to markets in Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. This would originate in Northeast Ohio and travel into Michigan, where it would interconnect with the Vector Pipeline, which provides access also into Ontario. It would be a 250-mile large diameter pipe and capable of moving at least 1 Bcf of gas a day. The initial investment is estimated to be $1.5 billion and our share would be 1/3 or $500 million. 
We're currently running an open season on this proposed pipe and that would run through the end of November. And we'll work with interested parties to establish binding agreements in the first half of next year. And if the timing goes as planned, that pipe would go into service in early 2016. We expect these new projects to provide substantial growth in earnings and help take the Gas Storage & Pipelines business from $60 million in earnings this year to $100 million in earnings by 2015. 
In the P&I segment, we're seeing good operational performance and throughput at our 5 sited REF machines. If you remember, there's 9 in total. And we're making good progress in siting the remaining 4. In fact, 1 of the 4 began commercial operations at a non-DTE site earlier this week. And we've executed agreements with another utility to relocate a unit at one of their sites. We're also engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the remaining 2 machines. So we're making good progress there. 
On the earnings call last quarter, I announced that we were acquiring a portfolio of on-site energy projects from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. As of last week, we closed on 12 of the 14 projects and expect to close on the remaining 2 sometime next month. Going forward, we see these projects contributing to our growth aspiration for the Power & Industrial projects from $50 million in earnings this year to $125 million by 2016. 
Now if we can turn to Page 7. I'd like to shift gears and give you an update on some developments on the regulatory front. MichCon is in the midst of a general rate case that was filed in April. At the end of September, we filed testimony with the Michigan Public Service Commission to self-implement up to $34 million beginning in November. This case will continue to play out over the next several months with the final decision no later than April of next year. 
At Detroit Edison, we were successful in reaching a constructive outcome related to the termination of the revenue decoupling mechanism and the related $127 million regulatory liability. As you might recall back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it ordered Detroit Edison to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism. Through the first quarter of 2012, Detroit Edison had accrued $127 million liability related to the pilot RDM, which represents hot weather, primarily in prior years, 2010 and 2011. 
Rather than taking the full $127 million into income upon the Court of Appeals decision, we filed an accounting application seeking authority to amortize that amount into income in 2014. The accounting treatment combined with other cost-saving actions would help offset the need for new rates in 2014 and is a key component of our plan to potentially push out the need for base rate increases until 2015. On September 25, the MPSC issued an order granting our request. 
Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on our 2012 earnings guidance. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, including a warmer-than-normal summer, we're confident in narrowing and raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. At Detroit Edison, the weather favorability not only allows us to increase the earnings guidance but also provide an opportunity for us to reinvest in our electric systems to improve the distribution system and power plant reliability. This includes things like line clearance and preventative maintenance to the distribution systems, power plants and our vehicle fleet. 
The outlook for MichCon has improved as well. You may recall that the unusually warm winter created quite a hole in MichCon in the first quarter. And we began signaling that they'd have to work really hard to hit even the bottom end of the range of their guidance. As a result of some one-time cost reduction actions that the team implemented, we're confident in reaffirming MichCon's earning guidance of $110 million to $115 million. The storage and transportation revenue at the Gas Storage & Pipelines segments are coming in strong, pushing guidance for this segment to a point estimate now of $60 million. 
Finally, Energy Trading continues to see fewer opportunities in a challenging and choppy market. So from where we stand now, we think the guidance range of $10 million to $25 million is appropriate, which includes approximately $10 million of after-tax roll-on that we expect to show up in the fourth quarter. So in total, we're confident in raising the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance to $3.90 with the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

I'd like to start on Page 10 and third quarter earnings results for the quarter. DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.31. Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss",550,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start on Page 10 and third quarter earnings results for the quarter. DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.31. Detroit Edison contributed $1.13 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss this quarter, actually came in $0.02 positive income. And I'll talk about more of that coming up. 
The nonutility segments combined to earn $0.22. The drivers to the nonutility second quarter results were Power & Industrial at $0.13; Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.08; Energy Trading at $0.01; and finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 11 as summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy were up $44 million in the quarter or $0.24 per share. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was at $194 million, up $37 million from the prior year. The favorable year-over-year performance was driven by warmer-than-normal weather flowing this year through earnings. 
Last year, a revenue decoupling mechanism was in effect, which temperature-normalized revenues. Now we continue to see stability in underlying load at our electric segment with temperature-normalized sales flat in the quarter net of a 1% impact of energy efficiency program reductions. Service territory industrial sales continued to grow, up 3% year-to-date. 
As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for our seasonal gas utility business. However, MichCon had an operating gain of $4 million for the quarter, up $15 million from prior year. The improvement to earnings was driven by higher transportation and storage service revenues along with lower lost gas expense in the quarter and lower O&M. This quarter is a clear demonstration that our continuous improvement efforts are paying off at MichCon. For example, the improvement in lost gas expense this quarter is a direct result of improvements in reducing fiscal losses through a series of operational improvements in system and in interconnects, improvements in metering technology and a step-up in distribution reliability investments. 
Our nonutility segments are down $8 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings at the 3 other segments. Energy Trading is down $21 million in this quarter year-over-year. The year-over-year results are driven by a combination of a stronger-than-normal third quarter 2011. And a larger portion of this year's economic performance is subject to accounting timing. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accounting earnings loss for this segment in the appendix, which shows the economic earnings in '12 versus '11.  
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is Power & Industrial project segment, which was up $10 million. This is driven primarily by the growth in our REF business line. Unconventional Gas Production improved earnings $2 million, breaking even in the quarter. The improvement was driven by higher oil production. Our production is up actually 97% year-over-year. As Dave mentioned, we are in the final strokes of a targeted year-end sales process for those properties. Finally, Gas Storage & Pipelines segment was up $1 million for the quarter to $14 million, and like MichCon, benefit from higher storage and transportation revenues. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to our Treasurer, Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."
266598,222470906,369678,"DTE Energy Co., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri",409,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me say it's good to be back here within finance at DTE. And I look forward to working closer with all of you on this call in the future. As I take over from our prior Treasurer, Nick Khouri, our commitment to cash flow and prudent balance sheet management remains a strong as ever. 
Now turning to Slide 13 and year-to-date cash flow and capital spending. 2012 cash flows are up, driven by increased cash recovery at the utilities, primarily related to the PSCR and the choice tracker regulatory recovery mechanisms in 2012 and an early 2011 cash pension contribution. This is slightly offset for the year by higher corporate tax payments. Capital spending is slightly higher in 2012 due to our investments in the Bluestone pipeline, as David mentioned, and higher base operating capital at the utilities, slightly offset by some lower renewables investment, a reminder that 2011 includes some large investments in our Gratiot wind park, which has since been placed into service. 
Then moving onto Slide 14 and the outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for cash from operations to $2.2 billion, driven by warm summer weather, again we plan for the year at weather-normal levels, and the impact of the RDM court ruling at Detroit Edison. Our original guidance at the beginning of the year assumed the decoupling balances we have begun to be refunded to customers this year. And as Dave mentioned earlier, the RDM amortization will begin in 2014. 
In addition, cash at our nonutility businesses is also expected to be higher in 2012. Capital spending is projected to be higher also. You'll see that detail to the right on the slide, where nonutility investments are up as a result of the acquisition of the on-site energy project portfolio from Duke Energy within our Power & Industrial group this October. We also anticipate a slight remixing of CapEx at Detroit Edison but still yielding roughly a total of $1.2 billion. 
And finally, finishing up with a look at the balance sheet and our credit metrics on Slide 15. Leverage and FFO to debt remained well within our targeted ranges. Liquidity is strong and our rating agency outlooks are positive. We've issued $160 million in equity year-to-date into our pension and benefit [indiscernible] program for the year. 
And now for the third quarter wrap-up, it's back over to you, Dave."

As we laid out for you, the results through the first 3 quarters are very solid. With a benefit of favorable summer weather, we're able to reinvest in our electric generation distribution systems and confidently raise the midpoint of our earnings guidance per share by $0.10. Setting aside the unusual weather this year, which is providing upside at Detroit Edison and pressure at MichCon, on a temperature-normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized returns. 
Longer term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated environmental-related investments and we're also seeing nice growth opportunities at the nonutility businesses. When you put this altogether, they combine to provide an overall long-term earnings growth per share of 5% to 6%. And as we indicated, we always do this by maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash flows.

And at the same time, we were also getting great opportunities on the procurement side. So there was a conscious decision there to pull ahead some of the spending. And on the environmental, what is playing out there is the success that we're experiencing on the DSI testing. Now if you recall that the DSI testing, we said that it turned out to be much more successful than we thought. And it's causing us to shift some of our capital spending over several years. And we will lay that out at the EEI when we lay out our capital for multiple years. We'll give you that in several weeks. But what you will see is it's going to allow us to make some DSI-related investments over the next couple of years and defer some of what we would've thought we would've been doing on scrubbers on some of our plants. And that will play out in the capital numbers that we'll show you."

And as you mentioned from the auto sales on an annualized basis, they've recently just come up with their numbers and they're at 14.9 million units. So we really haven't seen those levels probably for 5 to 6 years. So all indications are real strong from an economic indicator. On the residentials, on a year-to-date, temperature-normalized were flat. And typically for that segment, we will see about a 1% to 2% estimate on energy efficiency. So one way to think about it, we have growth, organic growth happening there that's offset by energy efficiency. The other thing that we really monitor from an economic perspective is the industrial. And we are seeing a 3% growth there year-over-year. And we are seeing strength in the autos and the steel segments."
