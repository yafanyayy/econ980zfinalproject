As many of you know, we successfully completed our spinoff from Expedia on December 20, 2011. The key strategic factors behind the spinoff were to unlock strategic value for shareholders by being able to clearly articulate the focus and strategy of each independent entity and to increase strategic flexibility as a pure play. It's a very exciting time for our business. 
Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought it would be helpful for me to provide a brief overview of TripAdvisor, who we are, what we do and how we measure our business. I'll then summarize the operating results for the fourth quarter and the year ending 2011 and discuss our strategic plan for 2012 and beyond. Finally, I'll turn the call over to Julie who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook.
In sum, you'll hear how we are striking a balance between growth and profitability while aggressively innovating and expanding into new markets to further advance our market leadership position. So a little background on TripAdvisor. Since founding the company in 2000, we have created an online travel community that through a deep, rich base of user-generated content helps travelers plan and take that perfect trip. With over 44 million monthly unique visitors, according to the fourth quarter ComScore data, TripAdvisor is the largest travel site in the world. 
Travelers visit TripAdvisor free of charge and are able to discover, research and select travel destinations and accommodations based upon independent reviews of other travelers. We have over 60 million reviews and opinions on approximately 550,000 hotels and accommodations and over 900,000 restaurants and attractions. On average, our users are quickly adding more than 40 pieces of content every minute. That's the fastest rate of absolute content growth in the company's 12-year history and computes to a run rate of over 20 million additions per year.
According to the 2011 IDC study, the travel industry represents roughly half of all global e-commerce transactions. On the other hand, only 16% of the approximately $39 billion spent on travel advertising in 2011 is spent online. As users continue to migrate online, we expect that the ad dollars will follow, and our robust user base will allow us to continue to leverage our leadership position and capture these high-margin dollars.
As the definitive online resource for travelers, we've become a critical partner for online advertisers, including hotels, online travel agencies and other travel-related service providers. Our scale makes TripAdvisor a critical strategic buy for online travel agents and hotel partners, allowing them to reach our large audience of highly qualified, highly engaged users. 
Currently, we work with OTA and hotel partners through a variety of products, including our core cost per click lead generation product, our cost per impression display product where we've begun addressing a broader swath of customers through our more nascent business listings product.
In 2011, 79% of total revenue came from our core cost per click lead gen product or as we refer to it, text link revenue. There are several key drivers that we watch closely related to our text link revenue. We think of it as a funnel, with total traffic growth -- while total traffic growth helps our brand grow, growth in hotel shoppers is the key driver of revenue and represents the top of the funnel. 
Hotel shoppers can loosely -- can be loosely defined as users on our site who view a listing of hotels in the city or visitors who view a specific hotel's page. After hotel shopper, we look at user conversion and specifically how much revenue that hotel shopper generates for us. 
Conversion on our site is primarily driven by 3 factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We think of merchandising as the number and location of ads available on a page; commerce coverage is whether we have a client who can take an online booking for this property; and choice as the number of clients available for any given property, allowing user to shop for the best price. 
In summary, our text link revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers we can get interested in the property, whether there's a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property and whether there are several commerce choices so the hotel shopper can shop around.
The final key driver we look at is the CPC prices OTAs and hoteliers are willing to pay us for our leads. As many of you know, we have an opaque bidding model, which generally true that the more client pays us on a per lead basis, the more traffic we will send them. In this regard, we have a very similar model to Google Ad Words. We assume, in fact, that all of our clients are also advertising on Google and continually adjust their media spend mix based on who can deliver the better return on investment.
In the fourth quarter, we saw steady year-over-year growth in hotel shoppers, strong coverage and strong choice. However, merchandising and average price per comparable lead were down relative to a year ago due to our recently completed site redesign, as well as reduced CPC pricing from Expedia, respectively.
And we are often asked to comment on our traffic growth and traffic sources and are aware that people often point to third-party traffic stats to analyze Internet companies relative business health. In the absence of us providing data from our internal logs on this topic, we think that comScore data is the best publicly available way to analyze year-over-year total traffic patterns. 
Although it's important to note that comScore data has always been lower than our own internal logs files. Now according to comScore, unique monthly visitors to TripAdvisor site increased 61% year-over-year in December, with an average of 44 million unique visitors per month during the fourth quarter. However, one must keep in mind when looking at third-party data that this does not -- that not -- it's important to keep in mind, however, that when looking at third-party data is that not all site traffic is created equal. 
For instance, comScore numbers track includes users that come to TripAdvisor to research restaurants and attractions, which are not as relevant when trying to analyze the hotel shoppers in our revenue funnel. To reiterate, our core revenue comes from monetizing hotel pages, so hotel shopper traffic is what interests us most. Therefore, an increase in traffic to our restaurant pages, for example, while a good thing in terms of building TripAdvisor's brand awareness, it does not necessarily have a direct positive effect on our revenue as we currently do not monetize our restaurant pages to a great degree. To spell it out, I can tell you that our December hotel shopper growth was not as high as the comScore December data would indicate.
Another frequently asked question that we've gotten a lot lately is to describe how our growth strategy will change not that we're a standalone company. The answer is simple, it won't. We continue to invest aggressively in areas where we see opportunity to innovate and leverage the TripAdvisor platform, specifically in our social, mobile and global initiatives, as well as our subscription-based businesses, which includes Vacation Rentals and Business Listings. Let me briefly touch upon each one of these.
Social, and specifically our Wisdom of Friends initiative, is a core component of our strategic growth plan as we believe it will both defend and increase our lead in our core business. 76% of respondents to a recent Nielsen study cited, ""recommendations from people I know"" as the #1 information source that they trust completely, and we believe that having a strong social presence drives traffic to and engagement on our sites, and creates more stickiness amongst our users. 
In fact, through our Wisdom of Friends initiative, we have determined that Facebook users are approximately 27% more engaged on TripAdvisor sites and contribute roughly 2x the amount of content than the average TripAdvisor user. We continue to deepen our integration with Facebook's Friends Graph, having instantly personalized the trip planning experience for more than 85 million Facebook users at the end of 2011. All of this valuable data allows us to further enhance the TripAdvisor user experience and keep travelers coming back to plan their next trip.
Mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the TripAdvisor brand when users are in market. In 2011, we saw a strong user uptake, reaching an aggregate of 13 million mobile downloads and approximately 16 million monthly unique users as measured by our own log files, up from 2 million downloads and 4 million monthly unique users in 2010. 
We launched 23 mobile City Guides for Android and iOS, offering access to TripAdvisor traveler reviews, as well as suggested itineraries and offline accessible interactive walking tours. In addition to in market functionality, we also think more people are starting their planning on mobile devices, whether in the cab on a smartphone or on the couch with an iPad or tablet. 
We saw this coming a while ago and are well-prepared technically and organizationally to take advantage of this platform shift. Our best guess is that the rise in hotel shoppers on mobile devices is coming to some degree at the expense of desktop traffic growth. We've made the conscious decision to focus on growing our mobile footprint with a great product and have chosen not to monetize that platform to its full potential at this time. We expect the long-term benefits of a more engaged mobile audience to outweigh the modest amount of short-term revenue we are foregoing.
We're also expanding our footprint globally. The past year, we saw a great increases in traffic in all major countries especially in the emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China. During 2011, we added points of sale in Taiwan, Malaysia and Egypt, bringing our total TripAdvisor branded websites to 30 countries in 21 languages. These and the other newer sites in Asia-Pacific will present a terrific longer-term opportunity for the company. One of the ways that we look at penetrate new markets is to leverage our expertise in search engine marketing or SEM. In mature markets, for instance, we tend to bid SEM to maximize profit, but in emerging markets, we may bid to breakeven or at a loss in order to build our brand, gain more users to our product, collect content and to scale more quickly. 
We have a long successful history of doing this. I'll point out the obvious. In all of our SEM spend, if we buy traffic at breakeven, the margin is 0. And even when we are buying traffic on a profitable basis, it may be less than our overall margins because of the sheer amount of free traffic and domain direct traffic we naturally get, particularly in our more established points of sale. We think SEM is a great channel because it delivers an incredible number of brand impressions, and it's a very cost-effective method to get people to try to product. To be clear, we'd like to buy additional traffic if we can do so on a profitable basis, even if will have a drag on margins.
In terms of content, we have over 40 million review translations, and we are committed to improving the in-country user experience and local feel for all of our points-of-sale. As a related note, when we launch a new feature in almost all cases, it's launched simultaneously worldwide. But based on the recent comScore data, TripAdvisor has less than 10% penetration of worldwide unique travel traffic, underscoring the fact that despite being the market leader, we have a lot of global growth opportunities ahead of us.
The biggest international opportunity in front of us is China. As you know, we have 2 lead product offerings in the Chinese market, DaoDao and, both headquartered in Beijing. Combined, we have over 225 employees in China as of the end of 2011, and we continue to invest heavily in the China market. We have been operating at a loss in China since launching DaoDao in 2009 and plan to continue investing in the business at EBITDA loss in 2012. There's little doubt that the opportunity there is large.
Finally, we continue to like what we're seeing at our fast-growing newer subscription base initiative, Vacation Rentals and Business Listings. Which are both areas of growth and investment for us. Our Vacation Rentals product addresses a highly fragmented $85 billion year industry according to a 2010 global market study. Historically, we have built our inventory through acquisitions, namely our U.S.-based FlipKey and U.K.-based HolidayLettings businesses, but during the fourth quarter, we announced partnerships aimed at increasing our inventory. We believe that our nearly 200,000 properties and our highly engaged, motivated community, positions us extremely well for success. We've recently bolstered the senior leadership of this product, and in 2012, we expect Vacation Rentals to continue to grow, benefiting from increased inventory, brand awareness and traffic to our TripAdvisor media group sites.
Our Business Listings product was created in early 2010 to allow hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent information on TripAdvisor, bringing them closer to the traveler and thereby, increasing direct bookings. In 2011, we saw nearly 80% subscriber growth reaching 35,000 Business Listings customers by the end of the year, which is still only around 6% of the site-wide hotel listings. In 2012, we are expanding our sales force in building out value-added features to upsell to this install base.
While we are pleased with the scale and diversified growth that we achieved in 2011, we are by no means satisfied. At TripAdvisor, our motto is speed wins, and our teams are focused on innovating fast and yet sometimes fast all in the spirit of improving the traveler experience, which we believe, in turn, should over the long term, enhance engagement and improve conversion rates for our clients. We have weekly releases across all points-of-sale and have recently completed significant design of some of our most important pages. We're proud of what we've done in terms of improving the site experience, and we've set the consequence of lower revenue per session due to this redesign.
I can't say that we won't make a similar decision again in the future, but at this time, we're not contemplating any changes that would create a similar downward step function in revenue for hotel shopper. Regardless of whether page changes have a positive or negative near-term revenue impact, we will continue to make the necessary trade-off to drive user growth and engagement on our site as we believe this will drive long-term shareholder value.
In summary, as we embark on 2012, we could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Before I close, I want to extend a sincere thank you to all of our TripAdvisor media group employees. Your continued dedication and hard work are greatly appreciated. Going forward, we will continue to invest in attracting, retaining and developing our world-class team. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, one of our newest additions to the executive team here at TripAdvisor, who will provide some color on the numbers and our financial outlook."
140233,145924651,218822,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

During my first 120 days on the job, I found an innovative culture coupled with strong operational focus. As you just heard in Steve's remarks, we operate a fast-moving business in a huge travel advertising market, which continues to grow with a secular shift from offline to online travel research and booking activity. 
We have a compelling business model with a strong network effect that delivers an increasingly diversified set of revenue streams across products and geographies. Our user-generated content model provides strong margins and high cash flow conversion. I'm going to outline some financial metrics that illustrate these attributes and lay out our thoughts for 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue grew 30% over the fourth quarter of 2010 to $137.8 million. For the full year 2011, revenue increased 31% over full year 2010 to $637.1 million. In terms of geography, the mix continues to diversify towards international, which more closely matches our traffic trend. As non-U.S. revenue was 40% -- 48% of total revenue this past quarter, compared to 41% in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Specifically, fourth quarter 2011 revenue was distributed 52% in the U.S., 14% in the U.K., and 34% in the rest of the world as measured by the website on which our ads are delivered. Note that we have a lot of international traffic that went on tripadvisor.com, our U.S. point-of-sale and clicks through to one of our partners' international site. 
For the year, total revenue was distributed 55% in the U.S., 15% in the U.K., and 30% in rest of the world. And our international revenue grew 55% year-over-year, further illustrating the exciting traction we are experiencing in our newer markets. As Steve mentioned, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets giving the opportunity that we see in front of us. We saw strong growth across all sources of revenue for the majority of the year. However, as expected, we did start to see growth decelerating from text link revenue in the back half of the year. 
Text link revenue for the fourth quarter was up 24% year-over-year, to $100 million, representing 72% of total revenue for the quarter. For full year 2011, text link revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $500 million and represented 79% of total revenue. Recall that this past quarter's revenue performance included a negative impact of our site redesign, which started rolling out across smaller point-of-sale at the beginning of 2011, and then completed in early Q4 after rolling out for a larger, more mature point-of-sale. 
Tying into Steve's earlier comments on merchandising metrics, the redesign improved the user experience but resulted in fewer leads to our partners. This combined with the impact of lower CPCs from Expedia, tempered our growth in the fourth quarter. You may also recall that in Q4 2010, Google Places was promoted more heavily in the Google search results, which created an easier comp for us this past quarter compared to the first 3 quarters of 2011. Were it not for the fact that we were comping the Google Places promotion, the impact from the CPC decline and the site redesign efforts would have further dampened our Q4 growth.
The display-based advertising revenue grew 26% in Q4 to $22.9 million, up from $18.2 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2011, display-based advertising was up 19% to $85.7 million as compared to $71.9 million for the full year 2010. Display-based advertising made up 17% of total revenue for Q4 and 13% for full-year 2011, highlighting a very strong Q4 for that product. 
Subscription and other revenue also had a very strong Q4, growing over 100% from the fourth quarter of 2010 to $15.1 million. Subscription and other revenue primarily include Business Listings and Vacation Rentals. For the year, subscription revenue grew 76% to $51.4 million, and billings are growing even faster as evidenced by the 60% increase in deferred revenue year-over-year. 
Subscription and other revenue made up 11% of total revenues in Q4 and 8% for full year 2011, highlighting the sequential acceleration. During the fourth quarter, revenues from Expedia was $37.5 million, up 3% year-over-year and 27% of total revenue. For the full year, revenue from Expedia was $211 million, up 23% year-over-year and 30% -- 33% of total revenue. As previously disclosed, we expected Expedia to lower its CPC pricing by approximately 10% to 15% given that they are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction -- given that we are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction for them. Our initial read is that the Expedia pricing decline is trending towards the upper end of that discount range.
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were 37% of revenue for this quarter and 32% for the year. In absolute dollars, this expense line item increased $15.5 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting our continued strategic investment in traffic acquisition and sales initiative, both in mature markets, as well as in newer geographies. 
To reiterate Steve's earlier comments, we believe our opportunity set is, and we are aggressively investing to further our lead in the market globally and in adjacent products like Vacation Rentals and Business Listings. The majority of these investments hit the sales and marketing expense line. For 2012, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow ahead of revenue and be in the high 30s to low 40s as a percent of total annual revenue and have similar seasonality to 2011. 
Non-GAAP content expenses were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 8% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012 as we leverage our platform and remain committed to our nimble speed wins development cycle. Our non-GAAP G&A expenses, which include the related party shared service fee were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 7% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012, even after some additional public company costs and the obligations to fund our charitable addition, which amounts to a contribution of approximately 2% of non-GAAP operating income.
In terms of headcount, we ended 2011 with 1,252 employees, up from 972 employees a year ago. We hired in all departments, but added disproportionately in G&A as we built up functions needed to transition away from Expedia Corporate Services. As Steve mentioned, we expect to continue to add talent to pursue our strategic initiatives in 2012 and beyond.
For the full year 2011, depreciation and amortization totaled $25.9 million or 4% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $17.3 million or 3% of revenue. For 2012, we expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011. And expect stock-based compensation expenses to increase slightly to approximately 4% of revenue.
Next, I would like to spend a moment on taxes. For the full year 2011, taxes on a GAAP basis were $94.1 million for an effective tax rate of 34.6%. There are 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate: the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and nondeductible stock compensation expense. In addition, this past year, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to nondeductible deferred tax purposes of certain transaction costs incurred for the spinoff from Expedia. 
In 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged to slightly lower, assuming our foreign income continues to grow at a faster pace than our domestic income and as our revenue continues to diversified group globally, we expect to benefit from lower foreign taxes, specifically in the U.K. and Singapore. As it relates to nondeductible transaction costs incurred in 2011, these are one-time in nature and therefore, will not impact 2012 results. However, we expect these benefits to be partially to fully offset by increase in state taxes. As a standalone company, a larger percentage of our earnings will be taxed in Massachusetts, our corporate headquarters versus the lower blended rate we recorded in 2011 as part of Expedia.
GAAP net income for the quarter was up 19% year-over-year to $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. GAAP net income for the year was up 28% to $177.7 million or $1.32 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $55.1 million, up 20% compared to the year-ago quarter. For full year 2011, adjusted EBITDA was $322.9 million, up 24% compared to the prior year. 
As expected, adjusted EBITDA margins narrowed to 40% for Q4 and 51% for 2011 as compared to 43% for Q4 2010 and 54% for full year 2010. As our year-end results were negatively impacted by revenue headwinds and increased public company costs, as well as by investments in our strategic growth initiative. In addition, Q4 is typically our adjusted EBITDA margin trough as revenue in Q4 is seasonally weaker.
Cash flow from operations was $26.2 million for the quarter and $217.9 million from the fill year or 19% and 34% of revenue, respectively. Cash flow from operations was 41% of revenue for full year 2010. The year-over-year decline in margin predominantly impacting Q4 was due to several spinoff-related working capital items. Historically, related revenue from Expedia was partially offset by expenses paid on TripAdvisor's behalf and settled through intercompany accounts. Going forward, Expedia receivables will be paid in the normal course thereby, increasing cash flow from operations. Assuming minimal working capital fluctuations, cash flow from operations should track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes paid.
CapEx for 2011 came in just under 4% of revenue and forecasted remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue in 2012, validating our low capital-intensive business model. In terms of liquidity, we ended the year with $183.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We were initially capitalized with $165 million of cash immediately following the spin. We have $190 million available under a revolving credit facility. Also at the close of the spinoff, we assumed $400 million of debt, of which 100% of the proceeds were paid out as a dividend to Expedia. We plan to service that debt from our strong cash flows, and we'll continue to assess our capital structure over time.
With that, let me turn our thoughts on guidance. Given that this is our first earnings call, we want you to understand that our intent is to run TripAdvisor to create long-term shareholder value. We have a simple yet incredibly powerful business model, built on a phenomenon of user-generated content in a lucrative online sector. Our more than 60 million reviews and opinions provide a huge competitive barrier to entry, but we know that there's so much more we can do to help our travelers and earn their loyalty.
We also know that we have competitors challenging us in all markets, and we will be aggressive in our efforts to defend the best trip planning experience and retain our market leadership position. As we are ultimately focused on building the business for the long term, we will not be providing specific quarter or annual guidance.
We will, however, provide you with some qualitative thoughts on how specific actions we have taken or plan on taking extends to our 2012 financials. We expect to see continued growth in traffic and engagement. The year-over-year revenue growth will not track to traffic because of the step functions caused by the site redesign and Expedia pricing changes. 
We currently forecast relatively flat CPC pricing on a full year basis compared to 2011. It is important to note that our forecast is very sensitive to pricing changes and that clients offer us little insight into their respective bidding strategy. Consider that over 1 billion annual clicks, every penny in CPC pricing impacts our revenues and profit by more than $10 million. However, based on our current assumptions of a slower growth rate at hotel shoppers at the top of the funnel, as well as pricing our top line text link revenue is not forecasted to grow as fast as it did in 2011. 
In our other products, we expect to see consistent growth in display advertising as compared to full year 2011. And for our subscription and other revenue, including Vacation Rentals and Business Listings, we forecast 2012 will be another triple-digit revenue growth year, albeit off a relatively small base. 
All in all, we expect total year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens and expect similar quarterly seasonality as compared to prior year. We recognize that our focus on this higher quality experience on both mobile and our desktop site have slowed revenue growth, but believe that it is the right long-term strategy for the company. We also have such confidence in the long-term outlook for the company that even in the face of a slower revenue growth in 2012, we are continuing our investment in international expansion, including China, in addition to strategic areas such as social, mobile and Vacation Rentals. 
All of these newer areas either run at a loss or a lower margin compared to our core business, but we feel that each has very high potential in the years ahead. When compiling the step function that has lowered our revenue growth with our continued investments in strategic initiatives, we forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be relatively flat to 2011 levels in terms of absolute dollars. As we lap these revenue headwinds and as the investments we've made to prior years and 2012 begins to pay off, we forecast returning to meaningful EBITDA growth in 2013. 
In closing, the fourth quarter capped a great 2011 by the company. We saw strong growth and positive trends across many of our key operating and financial metrics. Revenue continues to diversify, and margins remain healthy. We value striking a balance between growth and profitability. And currently given that we are in the early stage of our market opportunities, we are investing for future growth globally and in adjacent products. In 2012, we expect to build upon our successes and continue to drive long-term shareholder value by making the necessary investments to accelerate growth and profitability.

So, unfortunately, we still haven't broken out for everyone the international revenue if it was measured by where the traveler lives. Because as Julie had mentioned, we do have a fair amount of traffic of folks living overseas, landing on tripadvisor.com. They speak and understand English obviously, and we present very local commerce offerings to them, so the experience is perfectly good. We currently recognize this revenue as domestic revenue because it happens on the .com point-of-sale. Perhaps a more intuitive way of classifying it would be international revenue because of the customer, the traveler is actually living overseas and they are -- ended up transacting on a site that's probably in their own country. When you look at it that way, it's going to be -- it's already going to swing more towards the international revenue side than the current pie chart would show, and I don't know that answer offhand, so I can't even say whether it's already a majority or not in terms of international. It's one of those -- I'll stop laughing, but that's one of those things that we feel we should disclose to everyone going forward because it's a nice way to view that type of revenue. International in terms of traffic and in terms of commerce as 2011 showed does continue to grow, and as the growth rate even if we report the revenue on .com, it will become a smaller and smaller portion over time."

It's an excellent question. I -- and we do break it down a couple of different ways. We told you that we are projecting a modest decline in the growth in hotel shopper, so we're still obviously expecting more hotel shoppers on our points of sale, but the relative growth to 2011, we're expecting to be a little bit less. But part of that issue I think is in the U.S., we're already doing quite well and our overseas market, while growing quickly, aren't necessarily replacing the high growth that we've seen in .com and U.K. in past years. Second up, it's just a bit hard for us to forecast. We do get amount a fair amount of traffic from search engines all around the globe, and the various machinations that the search engines go through either change to search results so that it's best for whatever they think is best for their users or when they preferentially show their own traffic or their own product such as Google Places, it can have material impact on us. One could fairly argue we're being a little conservative with hotel shopper growth, but it's -- but I can take a counter argument as well in that Google Places could come on a little bit stronger. And on the subject of Google Places, I want to be clear, it's not that I actually worry about Google Places as a highly competitive product to TripAdvisor today because they don't have the content, it's hard to find users that prefer that experience. But Google does continue to have the ability to preferentially show their own product over other search or other websites like TripAdvisor. So there is that risk that stays out there in terms of Google pulling away some of the traffic that would have actually moved over to TripAdvisor. The second part of that question was?"

No, our other advertisers and spoken with many leading ones are really quite excited at Expedia having pulled back on their prices. Because in many cases, they've been the beneficiary of some additional traffic as Expedia may not be the top bidder in a slot at any point. None of the advertisers of any size have even brought up the topic of budget caps because on the CPC or the text link revenue, they really all measure it on a ROI basis. If we can deliver more leads at the same per unit volume, at the same per unit cost and if the leads stay high quality, then they'll take as many as we can send them. And it's extremely rare for a major client to say, hold off on sending the leads. The question for us in forecasting the CPCs, which again, as Julie mentioned, is quite material to us, is where are their either points-of-sale or parts of the world, where there becomes more interest in getting more leads from TripAdvisor. And everyone gets more leads when their traffic actually rises, but in seasons or when there's just more competition, the bidding process will bid up, and we will benefit."

The beauty of the community is that, most people just don't just write one review. We encourage them to write a second one and then we ask them to rate something for us and give us a helpful vote on someone else's review, and it just builds more of a community, more engagement, which, in turn, fuels more content. We, of course, love the content in all forms, whether it be a photo or rating, a room tip, because it makes the experience richer for the next person coming to TripAdvisor.

So that's things like G&A was projected much higher, but, of course, we had a couple of years left and we've already grown into those costs. But in sales and marketing, Steve spoke in remarks about our philosophy for being able to buy traffic and profitability and the profit margin profile of that. And I think over time, compared with the additional revenue headwinds on which are more significant as we look at than we had originally thought at that Analyst Day, as we had noted the CPC discount from Expedia in the top end of the range. And also we had thought there might be some additional increases in CPCs from other OTAs that we haven't seen. There's the potential that it's coming out, and we haven't seen it yet. So that, coupled with these changes, is getting us a revised range. Steve, maybe you just want to highlight the philosophy on the SEM?

And so, it is a drag on margins when we find a new keyword that we can bid on. Let's say, we bid $0.50 and we make $0.60, so all right, it's a profitable keyword, but at a pretty low margin. I'd like to -- I will continue to do that all day long, and even go breakeven or negative in a market that I feel we need to expand to Asia-Pacific in particular. But yes, it is a drag on margins. I'd highlight or reiterate which we had said in terms of there is the issue of site redesign, which had a bit more of an effect than we had originally projected and not all of it was fully known at that time. And then, the CPC hit from Expedia, we're fine, it's a step function. It comes down to then bidding as they would at that completely independent partner client. And we're waiting for the dynamics to settle in and how everyone else will continue to adjust their bids. And you can appreciate how, if the average price went up just $0.01 or $0.02 higher than the flattish forecast that we've put into our plan, then that potentially drops $10 million to $20 million or more into the top and bottom lines."

We see that perhaps as more of a shorter term phenomena as mobile web sites get better and better, mobile websites over clients I should say, gets better and better, but for us, we believe that the click that we sent over to check the prices on the suppliers website or OTA may not actually get the booking, and TripAdvisor's not necessarily going to get credit for a full transaction or a reservation made off the desktop the next day."

And then the direct piece is that, a lot of our direct spend there is the search engine marketing budget which, as I say, we're proud that we're able to grow year in, year out. And we use that as a vehicle to drive trial. So our bidding strategy on the mature versus newer markets and our marketing strategy in general, is certainly to invest in the areas that are newer or younger for us. So China being an example where we're investing in the most heavy, and then other Asia-Pacific countries where we might be at a breakeven level. Anything breakeven, it means some of the traffic we're buying were nicely profitable. If we don't have to bid up to every penny that we make. We can take profit on some terms, which means there some other terms that we're actually bidding at a loss on. And contrast that to the U.S. or U.K. or Canada, our more mature markets, where we really do try to make sure we're pulling in some profit on all of the terms that we bid on though as I said before, we're constantly looking for more ways to get traffic to the site. If things will can and do change with frequency or in support of other marketing campaigns or as we look to partner with some other folks in the region. So I'm trying to help you a little bit with some generalizations about the market, but please understand that in any given market, the strategy may be different for a short period of time."

I can say this now all of the clients I have spoken with the rest of the spinoff. They've all been uniformly viewing this as a positive event for them and for their relationship with TripAdvisor. One can actually understand how none are saying great, let me pay you more on a per unit basis now that you're different. Everyone's always often willing to pay more if there's a corresponding meaningful lift in traffic because we believe, in most cases, our clients are measuring the SEM, their SEM spend with us in much the way that we measure it with the search engines that we buy traffic from. i.e., they're trying in general maximize their profit that they can pull from a channel like TripAdvisor. So if a client feels that they can increase their bid and make more money because even though it's a unit cost slightly more expensive, we're sending an incremental amount of additional volume that's valuable to them, it drops to the bottom line. And they have a customer and customer that they can remarket to for that booking. So when we talk about our major clients, we really couldn't be happier with the reaction we've received and the partners, the dialogues continue at a much more detailed level in terms of helping us help them understand the best inventory they have relative to everyone else, how the -- how our traffic can convert relative to other sources and how we can now help them optimize their spend on TripAdvisor to the mutual benefit, whereas before, there was always it never happened, but there was always concern information that another client would tell us about their most effective properties would be fuel for what Expedia would then go do with that information. So again, it didn't happen in the past, but I can certainly appreciate the concern. And everyone's well aware of the Expedia pricing decreases, and that's -- people now feel like it's a much more level playing field. So we're very careful about never disclosing information from one client to the other, of course. But we're more than happy and are delighted with the conversations that had taken place so far that are now enabling us to help all of the other OTAs and the suppliers, in the most effective manner on our platform. Some may know, most of the OTAs and I would bet many of the suppliers kind of view TripAdvisor and Google as their by far 2 largest platforms for acquiring cost per click traffic. And I'm sure if I'm in their shoes, that in deciding where the next dollar to spend is, I'm going to try to maximize my return on investment and in some cases or in some markets that may be Google for the next click, but in an awful lot of areas, it's TripAdvisor because we can handle the volume of inventory they have, the bidding changes that they want automatically and be able to deliver them a scale that really nobody else in many cases, not even Google, can offer. So the short answer is, they're all very pleased."

As many of you know, we successfully completed our spin-off from Expedia on December 20, 2011. The key strategic factors behind the spin-off were to unlock strategic value for shareholders by being able to clearly articulate the focus and strategy of each independent entity and to increase strategic flexibility as a pure play. It is a very exciting time for our business. 
Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought it would be helpful for me to provide a brief overview of TripAdvisor, who we are, what we do, and how we measure our business. I'll then summarize the operating results for the fourth quarter and the year ending 2011 and discuss our strategic plan for 2012 and beyond. Finally, I'll turn the call over to Julie, who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook.
In sum, you'll hear how we are striking a balance between growth and profitability while aggressively innovating and expanding into new markets to further advance our market leadership position. So a little background on TripAdvisor. Since founding the company in 2000, we have created an online travel community that through a deep, rich base of user-generated content helps travelers plan and take that perfect trip. With over 44 million monthly unique visitors, according to the fourth quarter comScore data, TripAdvisor is the largest travel site in the world. 
Travelers visit TripAdvisor free of charge and are able to discover, research and select travel destinations and accommodations based upon independent reviews of other travelers. We have over 60 million reviews and opinions on approximately 550,000 hotels and accommodations and over 900,000 restaurants and attractions. On average, our users are currently adding more than 40 pieces of content every minute. That's the fastest rate of absolute content growth in the company's 12-year history and computes to a run rate of over 20 million additions per year.
According to the 2011 IDC study, the travel industry represents roughly half of all global e-commerce transactions. On the other hand, only 16% of the approximately $39 billion spent on travel advertising in 2011 is spent online. As users continue to migrate online, we expect that the ad dollars will follow, and our robust user base will allow us to continue to leverage our leadership position and capture these high-margin dollars.
As the definitive online resource for travelers, we have become a critical partner for online advertisers, including hotels, online travel agencies and other travel-related service providers. Our scale makes TripAdvisor a critical strategic buy for online travel agents and hotel partners, allowing them to reach our large audience of highly qualified, highly engaged users. 
Currently, we work with OTA and hotel partners through a variety of products, including our core cost-per-click lead generation product, our cost-per-impression display product where we've begun addressing a broader swath of customers through our more nascent business listing product.
In 2011, 79% of total revenue came from our core cost-per-click lead gen product, or as we refer to it, text link revenue. There are several key drivers that we watch closely related to our text link revenue. We think of it as a funnel. When total traffic growth -- while total traffic growth helps our brand grow, growth in hotel shoppers is the key driver of revenue and represents the top of the funnel. 
Hotel shoppers can loosely -- can be loosely defined as users on our site who view a listing of hotels in the city or visitors who view a specific hotel's page. After hotel shopper growth, we look at user conversion and specifically how much revenue that hotel shopper generates for us. 
Conversion on our site is primarily driven by 3 factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We think of merchandising as the number and location of ads available on a page; commerce coverage is whether we have a client who can take an online booking for this property; and choice as the number of clients available for any given property, allowing the user to shop for the best price. 
In summary, our text link revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers we can get interested in the property, whether there's a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property, and whether there are several commerce choices so the hotel shopper can shop around.
The final key driver we look at is the CPC price that OTAs and hoteliers are willing to pay us for our leads. As many of you know, we have an opaque bidding model, which generally true that the more client pays us on a per-lead basis, the more traffic we will send them. In this regard, we have a very similar model to Google Ad Words. We assume, in fact, that all of our clients are also advertising on Google and continually adjust their media spend mix based on who can deliver the better return on investment.
In the fourth quarter, we saw steady year-over-year growth in hotel shoppers, strong coverage and strong choice. However, merchandising and average price per comparable lead were down relative to a year ago due to our recently completed site redesign, as well as due to reduced CPC pricing from Expedia, respectively.
And we are often asked to comment on our traffic growth and traffic sources and are aware that people often point to third-party traffic stats to analyze Internet companies relative business health. In the absence of us providing data from our internal logs on this topic, we think that the comScore data is the best publicly available way to analyze year-over-year total traffic patterns. 
Although it's important to note that comScore data has always been lower than our own internal log files. Now according to comScore, unique monthly visitors to TripAdvisor site increased 61% year-over-year in December, with an average of 44 million unique visitors per month during the fourth quarter. However, one must keep in mind when looking at third-party data that this not -- that not -- it's important to keep in mind, however, that when looking at third-party data is that not all site traffic is created equal. 
For instance, comScore numbers track includes users that come to TripAdvisor to research restaurants and attractions, which are not as relevant when trying to analyze the hotel shoppers in our revenue funnel. To reiterate, our core revenue comes from monetizing hotel pages, so hotel shopper traffic is what interests us most. Therefore, an increase in traffic to our restaurant pages, for example, while a good thing in terms of building TripAdvisor's brand awareness, does not necessarily have a direct positive effect on our revenue as we currently do not monetize our restaurant pages to a great degree. To spell it out, I can tell you that our December hotel shopper growth was not as high as the comScore December data would indicate.
Another frequently asked question that we've gotten a lot lately is to describe how our growth strategy will change now that we're a standalone company. The answer is simple, it won't. We continue to invest aggressively in areas where we see opportunity to innovate and leverage the TripAdvisor platform, specifically in our social, mobile and global initiatives, as well as our subscription-based businesses, which includes vacation rentals and Business Listings. Let me briefly touch upon each one of these.
Social, and specifically our wisdom of friends initiative, is a core component of our strategic growth plan as we believe it will both defend and increase our lead in our core business. 76% of respondents to a recent Nielsen study cited, ""Recommendations from people I know"" as the #1 information source that they trust completely, and we believe that having a strong social presence drives traffic to and engagement on our sites, and creates more stickiness amongst our users. 
In fact, through our wisdom of friends initiative, we have determined that Facebook users are approximately 27% more engaged on TripAdvisor sites and contribute roughly 2x the amount of content than the average TripAdvisor user. We continue to deepen our integration with Facebook's friends graph, having instantly personalize the trip planning experience for more than 85 million Facebook users at the end of 2011. All of this valuable data allows us to further enhance the TripAdvisor user experience and keep travelers coming back to plan their next trip.
Mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the TripAdvisor brand when users are in market. In 2011, we saw a strong user uptake, reaching an aggregate of 13 million mobile downloads and approximately 16 million monthly unique users as measured by our own log files, up from 2 million downloads and 4 million monthly unique users in 2010. 
We launched 23 mobile City Guides for Android and iOS, offering access to TripAdvisor traveler reviews, as well as suggested itineraries and offline accessible interactive walking tours. In addition to in-market functionality, we also think more people are starting their planning on mobile devices, whether in a cab, on a smartphone or on the couch with an iPad or tablet. 
We saw this coming a while ago and are well-prepared technically and organizationally to take advantage of this platform shift. Our best guess is that the rise that -- the rise in the hotel shoppers on mobile devices is coming to some degree at the expense of desktop traffic growth. We've made the conscious decision to focus on growing our mobile footprint with a great product and have chosen not to monetize that platform to its full potential at this time. We expect the long-term benefits of a more engaged mobile audience to outweigh the modest amount of short-term revenue we are foregoing.
We are also expanding our footprint globally. The past year, we saw great increases in traffic in all major countries especially in the emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China. During 2011, we added points of sale in Taiwan, Malaysia and Egypt, bringing our total TripAdvisor-branded websites to 30 countries and 21 languages. These and the other newer sites in Asia-Pacific will present a terrific longer-term opportunity for the company. One of the ways that we look to penetrate new markets is to leverage our expertise in search engine marketing or SEM. In mature markets, for instance, we tend to bid SEM to maximize profit. But in emerging markets, we may bid to breakeven or at a loss in order to build our brand, gain more users to our product, collect content and to scale more quickly. 
We have a long successful history of doing this. I'll point out the obvious. In all of our SEM spend, if we buy traffic at breakeven, the margin is 0. And even when we are buying traffic on a profitable basis, it may be less than our overall margins because of the sheer amount of free traffic and domain direct traffic we get -- we naturally get, particularly in our more established points of sale. 
We think SEM is a great channel because it delivers an incredible number of brand impressions, and it's a very cost-effective method to get people to try the product. To be clear, we'd like to buy additional traffic if we can do so on a profitable basis, even if it will have a drag on margins.
In terms of content, we have over 40 million review translations, and we are committed to improving the in-country user experience and local feel for all of our points-of-sale. As a related note, when we launch a new feature, in almost all cases, it's launched simultaneously worldwide. But based on the recent comScore data, TripAdvisor has less than 10% penetration of worldwide unique travel traffic, underscoring the fact that despite being the market leader, we have a lot of global growth opportunities ahead of us.
The biggest international opportunity in front of us is China. As you know, we have 2 lead product offerings in the Chinese market, DaoDao and Kuxun, both headquartered in Beijing. Combined, we have over 225 employees in China as of the end of 2011, and we continue to invest heavily in the China market. We have been operating at a loss in China since launching DaoDao in 2009 and plan to continue investing in the business at an EBITDA loss in 2012. There's little doubt that the opportunity there is large.
Finally, we continue to like what we are seeing in our fast-growing newer subscription-based initiatives, vacation rentals and Business Listings, which are both areas of growth and investment for us. Our vacation rentals product addresses a highly fragmented $85 billion year industry according to a 2010 Radius Global Market Study. Historically, we have built our inventory through acquisitions, namely our U.S.-based FlipKey and U.K.-based Holiday Lettings businesses, but during the fourth quarter, we announced partnerships aimed at increasing our inventory. 
We believe that our nearly 200,000 properties and our highly engaged and motivated community positions us extremely well for success. We have recently bolstered the senior leadership of this product, and in 2012, we expect vacation rentals to continue to grow, benefiting from increased inventory, brand awareness and traffic to our TripAdvisor media group sites.
Our Business Listings product was created in early 2010 to allow hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent information on TripAdvisor, bringing them closer to the traveler and thereby, increasing direct bookings. In 2011, we saw nearly 80% subscriber growth reaching 35,000 Business Listing customers by the end of the year, which is still only around 6% of the site-wide hotel listings. In 2012, we are expanding our sales force in building out value-added features to upsell to this install base.
While we are pleased with the scale and diversified growth that we achieved in 2011, we are by no means satisfied. At TripAdvisor, our motto is speed wins, and our teams are focused on innovating fast and yet, sometimes failing fast, all in the spirit of improving the traveler experience, which we believe, in turn, should over the long term, enhance engagement and improve conversion rates for our clients. We have weekly releases across all points-of-sale and have recently completed a significant design of some of our most important pages. We're proud of what we've done in terms of improving the site experience, and we accept the consequence of lower revenue per session due to this redesign.
I can't say that we won't make a similar decision again in the future, but at this time, we're not contemplating any changes that would create a similar downward step function in revenue per hotel shopper. Regardless of whether page changes have a positive or negative near-term revenue impact, we will continue to make the necessary trade-off to drive user growth and engagement on our site as we believe this will drive long-term shareholder value.
In summary, as we embark on 2012, we could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Before I close, I want to extend a sincere thank you to all of our TripAdvisor media group employees. Your continued dedication and hard work are greatly appreciated. Going forward, we will continue to invest in attracting, retaining and developing our world-class team. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, one of our newest additions to the executive team here at TripAdvisor, who will provide some color on the numbers and our financial outlook."

During my first 120 days on the job, I found an innovative culture coupled with strong operational focus. As you just heard in Steve's remarks, we operate a fast-moving business in a huge travel advertising market, which continues to grow with a secular shift from offline to online travel research and booking activity. 
We have a compelling business model with a strong network effect that delivers an increasingly diversified set of revenue streams across products and geographies. Our user-generated content model provides strong margins and high cash flow conversion. I'm going to outline some financial metrics that illustrate these attributes and lay out our thoughts for 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue grew 30% over the fourth quarter of 2010 to $137.8 million. For the full year 2011, revenue increased 31% over full year 2010 to $637.1 million. In terms of geography, the mix continues to diversify towards international, which more closely matches our traffic trend. As non-U.S. revenue was 40% -- 48% of total revenue this past quarter, compared to 41% in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Specifically, fourth quarter 2011 revenue was distributed 52% in the U.S., 14% in the U.K., and 34% in the rest of the world as measured by the website on which our ads are delivered. Note that we have a lot of international traffic lands on tripadvisor.com, our U.S. point-of-sale and clicks through to one of our partners' international site. 
For the year, total revenue was distributed 55% in the U.S., 15% in the U.K., and 30% in rest of the world. And our international revenue grew 55% year-over-year, further illustrating the exciting traction we are experiencing in our newer markets. As Steve mentioned, we'd continue to invest aggressively in our international markets given the opportunity that we see in front of us. 
We saw strong growth across all sources of revenue for the majority of the year. However, as we expected, we did start to see growth decelerating from text link revenue in the back half of the year.  Text link revenue for the fourth quarter was up 24% year-over-year to $100 million, representing 72% of total revenue for the quarter. 
For full year 2011, text link revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $500 million and represented 79% of total revenue. Recall that this past quarter's revenue performance included the negative impact of our site redesign, which started rolling out across smaller points-of-sale at the beginning of 2011, and then completed in early Q4 after rolling out for a larger, more mature points-of-sale. 
Tying into Steve's earlier comments on merchandising metrics, the redesign improved the user experience but resulted in fewer leads to our partners. This, combined with the impact of lower CPCs from Expedia, tempered our growth in the fourth quarter. You may also recall that in Q4 2010, Google Places was promoted more heavily in the Google search results, which created an easier comp for us this past quarter compared to the first 3 quarters of 2011. Were it not for the fact that we were comping the Google Places promotion, the impact from the CPC decline and the site redesign efforts would have further dampened our Q4 growth.
Display-based advertising revenue grew 26% in Q4 to $22.9 million, up from $18.2 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2011, display-based advertising was up 19% to $85.7 million as compared to $71.9 million for the full year 2010. Display-based advertising made up 17% of total revenue for Q4 and 13% for full-year 2011, highlighting a very strong Q4 for that product. 
Subscription and other revenue also had a very strong Q4, growing over 100% from the fourth quarter of 2010 to $15.1 million. Subscription and other revenue primarily include Business Listings and vacation rentals. For the year, subscription revenue grew 76% to $51.4 million, and billings are growing even faster as evidenced by the 60% increase in deferred revenue year-over-year. 
Subscription and other revenue made up 11% of total revenue in Q4 and 8% for full year 2011, highlighting the sequential acceleration. During the fourth quarter, revenue from Expedia was $37.5 million, up 3% year-over-year and 27% of total revenue. For the full year, revenue from Expedia was $211 million, up 23% year-over-year and 30% -- 33% of total revenue. As previously disclosed, we expected Expedia to lower its CPC pricing by approximately 10% to 15% given that they are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction -- given that we are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction for them. Our initial read is that the Expedia pricing decline is trending towards the upper end of that discount range.
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were 37% of revenue for this quarter and 32% for the year. In absolute dollars, this expense line item increased $15.5 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting our continued strategic investment in traffic acquisition and field sales initiative, both in mature markets, as well as in newer geographies. 
To reiterate Steve's earlier comments, we believe our opportunity set is immense, and we are aggressively investing to further our lead in the market globally and in adjacent products like vacation rentals and Business Listings. The majority of these investments hit the sales and marketing expense line. For 2012, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow ahead of revenue and be in the high 30s to low 40s as a percent of total annual revenue and have similar seasonality to 2011. 
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 8% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012 as we leverage our platform and remain committed to our nimble speed wins development cycle. Our non-GAAP G&A expenses, which include the related party shared service fee were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 7% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012, even after assuming additional public company costs and the obligation to fund our charitable foundation, which amounts to a contribution of approximately 2% of non-GAAP operating income.
In terms of headcount, we ended 2011 with 1,252 employees, up from 972 employees a year ago. We hired in all departments, but added disproportionately in G&A as we build out functions needed to transition away from Expedia Corporate Services. As Steve mentioned, we expect to continue to add talent to pursue our strategic initiatives in 2012 and beyond.
For the full year 2011, depreciation and amortization totaled $25.9 million or 4% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $17.3 million or 3% of revenue. For 2012, we expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011. And expect stock-based compensation expenses to increase slightly to approximately 4% of revenue.
Next, I would like to spend a moment on taxes. For the full year 2011, taxes on a GAAP basis were $94.1 million for an effective tax rate of 34.6%. There are 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate: the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and non-deductible stock compensation expense. In addition, this past year, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of certain transaction costs incurred for the spin-off from Expedia. 
In 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged to slightly lower, assuming our foreign income continues to grow at a faster pace than our domestic income and as our revenue continues to diversify globally, we expect to benefit from lower foreign taxes, specifically in the U.K. and Singapore. As it relates to non-deductible transaction costs incurred in 2011, these are onetime in nature and, therefore, will not impact 2012 results. However, we expect these benefits to be partially to fully offset by increase in state taxes. As a standalone company, a larger percentage of our earnings will be taxed in Massachusetts, our corporate headquarters, versus the lower blended rate we recorded in 2011 as part of Expedia.
GAAP net income for the quarter was up 19% year-over-year to $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. GAAP net income for the year was up 28% to $177.7 million or $1.32 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $55.1 million, up 20% compared to the year ago quarter. For full year 2011, adjusted EBITDA was $322.9 million, up 24% compared to the prior year. 
As expected, adjusted EBITDA margins narrowed to 40% for Q4 and 51% for 2011 as compared to 43% for Q4 2010 and 54% for full year 2010 as our year-end results were negatively impacted by revenue headwinds and increased public company costs, as well as by investments in our strategic growth initiative. In addition, Q4 is typically our adjusted EBITDA margin trough as revenue in Q4 is seasonally weaker.
Cash flow from operations was $26.2 million for the quarter and $217.9 million from the full year or 19% and 34% of revenue, respectively. Cash flow from operations was 41% of revenue for full year 2010. The year-over-year decline in margin predominantly impacting Q4 was due to several spin-off-related working capital items. 
Historically, related-party revenue from Expedia was partially offset by expenses paid on TripAdvisor's behalf and settled through intercompany accounts. Going forward, Expedia receivables will be paid in the normal course, thereby, increasing cash flow from operations. Assuming minimal working capital fluctuations, cash flow from operations should track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes paid.
CapEx for 2011 came in just under 4% of revenue and then forecasted to remain in the low-single digits as a percent of revenue in 2012, validating our low capital-intensive business model. In terms of liquidity, we ended the year with $183.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We were initially capitalized with $165 million of cash immediately following the spin. We have $190 million available under a revolving credit facility. Also at the close of the spin-off, we assumed $400 million of debt, of which 100% of the proceeds were paid out as a dividend to Expedia. We plan to service that debt from our strong cash flows, and we'll continue to assess our capital structure over time.
With that, let me turn our thoughts on guidance. Given that this is our first earnings call, we want you to understand that our intent is to run TripAdvisor to create long-term shareholder value. We have a simple, yet incredibly powerful business model, built on a phenomenon of user-generated content in a lucrative online sector, travel. Our more than 60 million reviews and opinions provide a huge competitive barrier to entry, but we know that there is so much more we can do to help our travelers and earn their loyalty.
We also know that we have competitors challenging us in all markets, and we will be aggressive in our efforts to defend the best trip planning experience and retain our market leadership position. As we are ultimately focused on building the business for the long term, we will not be providing specific quarter or annual guidance.
We will, however, provide you with some qualitative thoughts on how specific actions we had taken or plan on taking extends to our 2012 financials. We expect to see continued growth in traffic and engagement. The year-over-year revenue growth will not track to traffic because of the step functions caused by the site redesign and the Expedia pricing changes. 
We currently forecast relatively flat CPC pricing on a full year basis compared to 2011. It is important to note that our forecast is very sensitive to pricing changes and that clients offer us little insight into their respective bidding strategy. Consider that on over 1 billion annual clicks, every penny in CPC pricing impacts our revenues and profit by more than $10 million. However, based on our current assumptions of a slower growth rate of hotel shoppers at the top of the funnel, as well as flat pricing, our top line text link revenue is not forecasted to grow as fast as it did in 2011. 
In our other products, we expect to see consistent growth in display advertising as compared to full year 2011. And for our subscription and other revenue, including vacation rentals and Business Listings, we forecast 2012 will be another triple-digit revenue growth year, albeit off a relatively small base. 
All in all, we expect total year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens and expect similar quarterly seasonality as compared to prior year. We recognize that our focus on this higher quality experience on both mobile and our desktop site have slowed our revenue growth, but believe that it is the right long-term strategy for the company. 
We also have such confidence in the long-term outlook for the company that even in the face of a slower revenue growth in 2012, we are continuing our investment in international expansion, including China, in addition to strategic areas such as social, mobile and vacation rentals. 
All of these newer areas either run at a loss or a lower margin compared to our core business, but we feel that each has very high potential in the years ahead. When compiling the step function that has lowered our revenue growth with our continuing investments in strategic initiatives, we forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be relatively flat to 2011 levels in terms of absolute dollars. As we lap these revenue headwinds and as the investments we've made in prior years and 2012 begin to pay off, we forecast returning to meaningful EBITDA growth in 2013. 
In closing, the fourth quarter capped a great 2011 for the company. We saw strong growth and positive trends across many of our key operating and financial metrics. Revenue continues to diversify, and margins remain healthy. We value striking a balance between growth and profitability. And currently, given that we are in the early stage of our market opportunities, we are investing for future growth globally and in adjacent products. In 2012, we expect to build upon our successes and continue to drive long-term shareholder value by making the necessary investments to accelerate growth and profitability.

So, unfortunately, we still haven't broken out for everyone the international revenue if it was measured by where the traveler lives. Because as Julie had mentioned, we do have a fair amount of traffic of folks living overseas, landing on tripadvisor.com. They speak and understand English, obviously, and we present very local commerce offerings to them, so the experience is perfectly good. We currently recognize this revenue as domestic revenue because it happens on the .com point-of-sale. Perhaps a more intuitive way of classifying it would be international revenue because the customer -- the traveler is actually living overseas, and they are -- ended up transacting on a site that's probably in their own country. When you look at it that way, it's going to be -- it's already going to swing more towards the international revenue side than the current pie chart would show. And I don't know that answer off hand, so I can't even say whether it's already a majority or not in terms of international. It's one of those -- I'll stop blabbing, but that's one of those things that we feel we should disclose to everyone going forward because it's a nice way to view that type of revenue. International in terms of traffic and in terms of commerce, as 2011 showed, does continue to grow, and as the growth rate even if we report the revenue on .com, it will become a smaller and smaller portion over time."

It's an excellent question. I -- and we do break it down in a couple of different ways. We told you that we are projecting a modest decline in the growth in hotel shopper, so we're still obviously expecting more hotel shoppers on our points of sale, but the relative growth to 2011, we're expecting to be a little bit less. But part of that issue, I think, is in the U.S., we're already doing really quite well and our overseas market, while growing quickly, aren't necessarily replacing the high growth that we had seen in, say, .com and co.uk in past years. Second up, it's just a bit hard for us to forecast. We do get a fair amount of traffic from search engines all around the globe, and the various machinations that the search engines go through either to change the search results so that it's best for whatever they think is best for their users or when they preferentially show their own traffic or their own product such as Google Places, it can have a material impact on us. So one could fairly argue we're being a little conservative in hotel shopper growth, but it's -- but I can take the counter argument as well in that Google Places could come on a little bit stronger. And on the subject of Google Places, I want to be clear, it's not that I actually worry about Google Places as a highly competitive product to TripAdvisor today because they don't have the content. It's hard to find users that prefer that experience. But Google does continue to have the ability to preferentially show their own product over other searches or other websites like TripAdvisor. So there is that risk that stays out there in terms of Google pulling away some of the traffic that would have naturally moved over to TripAdvisor. The second part of that question was?"

No, our other advertisers and spoken with many leading ones are really quite excited at Expedia having pulled back on their prices.

None of the advertisers of any size have even brought up the topic of budget caps because on the CPC or the text link revenue, they really all measure it on a ROI basis. They -- if we can deliver more leads at the same per unit volume -- or at the same per unit cost and if the leads stay high quality, then they'll take as many as we can send them. And it's extremely rare for a major client to say, hold off on sending the leads. The question for us in forecasting the CPCs, which again, as Julie mentioned, is quite material to us, is where are their either points-of-sale or parts of the world, where there becomes more interest in getting more leads from TripAdvisor. And everyone gets more leads when their traffic actually rises, but in the shoulder seasons, or when there's just more competition, the bidding process will bid up, and we will benefit."

Scott, I'll take the first part of that question. So one thing to keep in mind that, I believe, we said on the Analyst Day when we showed our operating model that had adjusted EBITDA at the 42% to 47% range, what we were trying to do there is we have given out several pieces of information regarding things that would happen directly correlated to the spin such as the reduction of CPCs from Expedia and also the addition of public company costs and then layered in some of our early thoughts on additional investments that were taking hold in some of those strategic areas, and we applied those changes to the 2010 financials to get at what -- a range would be -- had we had these items in 2010. So that's some things like G&A was projected much higher, but, of course, we had a couple of years left, and we have already grown into those costs. But in sales and marketing, Steve spoke in remarks little about our philosophy for being able to buy traffic and profitability and the profit margin profile of that. And I think over time, compared with the additional revenue headwinds, which are more significant as we look at than we had originally thought at that Analyst Day, as we had noted the CPC discount from Expedia is in the top end of the range. And also, we had thought there might be some additional increases in CPCs from other OTAs that we haven't seen. There's the potential that it's coming out, but we haven't seen it yet. So that, coupled with these changes, is getting us a revised range. Steve, maybe you want to just highlight the philosophy on the SEM? Expand a bit because that is the largest change from the illustrative post-spin operating model?"

And so, it is a drag on margins when we find a new keyword that we can bid on. Let's say, we bid $0.50, and we make $0.60. So all right, it's a profitable keyword, but at a pretty low margin. I'd like to -- I will continue to do that all day long and even go breakeven or negative in a market that I feel we need to expand to, Asia-Pacific in particular. But yes, it is the drag on margins. I'd highlight or I'd reiterate which we had said in terms of -- there is the issue of the site redesign, which had a bit more of an effect than we had originally projected and not all of it was fully known at that time. And then, the CPC hit from Expedia, yes, we're fine. It's a step function. It comes down to then bidding as they would as a completely independent partner -- client. And we're waiting for the dynamics to settle in and how everyone else will continue to adjust their bids. And you can appreciate how if the average price ends up just $0.01 or $0.02 higher than the flattish forecast that we've put into our plan, then that potentially drops $10 million to $20 million or more into the top and bottom lines."

And we don't have sort of the sponsorship which is another component of the display revenue. And the -- our desire to monetize on the hotel booking, it's just -- that's less opportunity, if you will. We hear from our clients that the booking window is generally much less, much shorter, on the mobile, and that kind of makes sense. You're perhaps in the car or you're at a hotel one night, but you'll be in a different city the next night, and you need to go book the room and you have your mobile device as opposed your whole desktop. We're also aware that some folks may, in fact, be doing some of their research on their trusted TripAdvisor sites in mobile land because we have great apps with all the power, all the functionality. But it's mobile and a bunch of our clients are not necessarily as good as everyone would like to be and actually consummating the transaction. So maybe a little bit of what's happening is folks are exploring on mobile, doing the research, picking the hotel, and then maybe it's easier to pick up the phone and call the hotel. We see that perhaps as more of a shorter-term phenomena as mobile websites get better and better -- mobile websites of our clients, I should say, gets better and better, but for us, it means that lead that the click that we send over to check the prices on the suppliers' website or an OTA may not actually get the booking, and TripAdvisor is not necessarily going to get credit for a phone transaction or a reservation made off the desktop the next day."

And then the direct piece is that a lot of our direct spend there is the search engine marketing budget which, as I say, we're proud that we're able to grow year in, year out and we use as a vehicle to drive trial. So our bidding strategy on the mature versus newer markets and our marketing strategy in general, is certainly to invest in the areas that are newer or younger for us. So China being an example where we're investing the most heavy, and then other Asia-Pacific countries where we might be at a breakeven level. And if you think breakeven, it means, hey, some of the traffic we're buying were nicely profitable on because we don't have to bid up to every penny that we make. We can take profit on some terms, which means there are some other terms that we're actually bidding at a loss on. And contrast that to the U.S. or U.K. or Canada, some of our more mature markets where we really do try to make sure we're pulling in some profit on all of the terms that we bid on though as I said before, we're constantly looking for more ways to get traffic to the site. If things will -- can and do change with frequency or in support of other marketing campaigns or as we look to partner with some other folks in the region. So I'm trying to help you a little bit with some generalizations about the markets, but please understand that in any given market, the strategy may be different for a short period of time."

We are very pleased with the reaction of all -- I can say this now, all of the clients that I have spoken with, with regard to the spin-off have all been uniformly viewing this as a positive event for them and for their relationship with TripAdvisor. One can actually understand how none are saying, ""Great, let me pay you more on a per unit basis now that you're different."" Everyone's always often willing to pay more if there's a corresponding meaningful lift in the traffic because we believe, in most cases, our clients are measuring the SEMs -- their SEM spend with us in much the way that we measure it with the search engines that we buy traffic from. i.e., they're trying to, in general, maximize the profit that they can pull from a channel like TripAdvisor. So if a client feels that they can increase their bid and make more money because even though it's a unit cost slightly more expensive, we're sending an incremental amount of additional volume, that's valuable to them. It drops to the bottom line. And they have a customer and a customer that they can remarket to for that booking. So -- and when we talk about our major clients, we really couldn't be happier with the reaction we received and the partners -- the dialogues continue at a more -- much more detailed level in terms of helping us help them understand the best inventory they have relative to everyone else, how the -- how our traffic can convert relative to other sources and how we can now help them optimize their spend on TripAdvisor to the mutual benefit. Whereas before, there was always -- it never happened, but there was always concern that information that another client would tell us about their most effective properties would be fuel for what Expedia would then go do with that information. So again, it didn't happen in the past, but I can certainly appreciate the concern. And everyone's well aware of the Expedia pricing decreases, and that's -- and people now feel like it's a much more level playing field. So we're very careful about never disclosing information from one client to the other, of course. But we're more than happy and are delighted with the conversations that have taken place so far that are now enabling us to help all of the other OTAs and the suppliers, be it in the most effective manner on our platform. As some may know, most of the OTAs, and I would bet many of the suppliers kind of view TripAdvisor and Google as their, by far, 2 largest platforms for acquiring cost-per-click traffic. And I'm sure if I'm in their shoes, that in deciding where the next dollar to spend is, I'm going to try to maximize my return on investment and in some cases, or in some markets that may be Google for the next click, but in an awful lot of areas, it's TripAdvisor because we can handle the volume of inventory they have, the bidding changes that they want automatically and be able to deliver them a scale that really nobody else -- in many cases, not even Google can offer. So the short answer is, they're all very pleased."

As many of you know, we successfully completed our spin-off from Expedia on December 20, 2011. The key strategic factors behind the spin-off were to unlock strategic value for shareholders by being able to clearly articulate the focus and strategy of each independent entity and to increase strategic flexibility as a pure play. It is a very exciting time for our business. 
Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought it would be helpful for me to provide a brief overview of TripAdvisor, who we are, what we do, and how we measure our business. I'll then summarize the operating results for the fourth quarter and the year ending 2011 and discuss our strategic plan for 2012 and beyond. Finally, I'll turn the call over to Julie, who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook.
In sum, you'll hear how we are striking a balance between growth and profitability while aggressively innovating and expanding into new markets to further advance our market leadership position. 
So a little background on TripAdvisor. Since founding the company in 2000, we have created an online travel community that through a deep, rich base of user-generated content helps travelers plan and take that perfect trip. With over 44 million monthly unique visitors, according to the fourth quarter comScore data, TripAdvisor is the largest travel site in the world. 
Travelers visit TripAdvisor free of charge and are able to discover, research and select travel destinations and accommodations based upon independent reviews of other travelers. We have over 60 million reviews and opinions on approximately 550,000 hotels and accommodations and over 900,000 restaurants and attractions. On average, our users are currently adding more than 40 pieces of content every minute. That's the fastest rate of absolute content growth in the company's 12-year history and computes to a run rate of over 20 million additions per year.
According to the 2011 IDC study, the travel industry represents roughly half of all global e-commerce transactions. On the other hand, only 16% of the approximately $39 billion spent on travel advertising in 2011 is spent online. As users continue to migrate online, we expect that the ad dollars will follow, and our robust user base will allow us to continue to leverage our leadership position and capture these high-margin dollars.
As the definitive online resource for travelers, we have become a critical partner for online advertisers, including hotels, online travel agencies and other travel-related service providers. Our scale makes TripAdvisor a critical strategic buy for online travel agents and hotel partners, allowing them to reach our large audience of highly qualified, highly engaged users. 
Currently, we work with OTA and hotel partners through a variety of products, including our core cost-per-click lead generation product, our cost-per-impression display product where we've begun addressing a broader swath of customers through our more nascent business listing product.
In 2011, 79% of total revenue came from our core cost-per-click lead gen product, or as we refer to it, text link revenue. There are several key drivers that we watch closely related to our text link revenue. We think of it as a funnel. When total traffic growth -- while total traffic growth helps our brand grow, growth in hotel shoppers is the key driver of revenue and represents the top of the funnel. 
Hotel shoppers can loosely -- can be loosely defined as users on our site who view a listing of hotels in the city or visitors who view a specific hotel's page. After hotel shopper growth, we look at user conversion and specifically how much revenue that hotel shopper generates for us. 
Conversion on our site is primarily driven by 3 factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We think of merchandising as the number and location of ads available on a page; commerce coverage is whether we have a client who can take an online booking for this property; and choice as the number of clients available for any given property, allowing the user to shop for the best price. 
In summary, our text link revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers we can get interested in the property, whether there's a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property, and whether there are several commerce choices so the hotel shopper can shop around.
The final key driver we look at is the CPC price that OTAs and hoteliers are willing to pay us for our leads. As many of you know, we have an opaque bidding model, so it's generally true that the more client pays us on a per-lead basis, the more traffic we will send them. In this regard, we have a very similar model to Google Ad Words. We assume, in fact, that all of our clients are also advertising on Google and continually adjust their media spend mix based on who can deliver the better return on investment.
In the fourth quarter, we saw steady year-over-year growth in hotel shoppers, strong coverage and strong choice. However, merchandising and average price per comparable lead were down relative to a year ago due to our recently completed site redesign, as well as due to reduced CPC pricing from Expedia, respectively.
And we are often asked to comment on our traffic growth and traffic sources and are aware that people often point to third-party traffic stats to analyze Internet companies relative business health. In the absence of us providing data from our internal logs on this topic, we think that the comScore data is the best publicly available way to analyze year-over-year total traffic patterns. 
Although it's important to note that comScore data has always been lower than our own internal log files. Now according to comScore, unique monthly visitors to TripAdvisor site increased 61% year-over-year in December, with an average of 44 million unique visitors per month during the fourth quarter. However, one must keep in mind when looking at third-party data that this not -- that not -- it's important to keep in mind, however, that when looking at third-party data is that not all site traffic is created equal. 
For instance, comScore numbers track includes users that come to TripAdvisor to research restaurants and attractions, which are not as relevant when trying to analyze the hotel shoppers in our revenue funnel. To reiterate, our core revenue comes from monetizing hotel pages, so hotel shopper traffic is what interests us most. Therefore, an increase in traffic to our restaurant pages, for example, while a good thing in terms of building TripAdvisor's brand awareness, does not necessarily have a direct positive effect on our revenue as we currently do not monetize our restaurant pages to a great degree. To spell it out, I can tell you that our December hotel shopper growth was not as high as the comScore December data would indicate.
Another frequently asked question that we've gotten a lot lately is to describe how our growth strategy will change now that we're a standalone company. The answer is simple, it won't. We continue to invest aggressively in areas where we see opportunity to innovate and leverage the TripAdvisor platform, specifically in our social, mobile and global initiatives, as well as our subscription-based businesses, which includes vacation rentals and Business Listings. Let me briefly touch upon each one of these.
Social, and specifically our wisdom of friends initiative, is a core component of our strategic growth plan as we believe it will both defend and increase our lead in our core business. 76% of respondents to a recent Nielsen study cited, ""Recommendations from people I know"" as the #1 information source that they trust completely, and we believe that having a strong social presence drives traffic to and engagement on our sites, and creates more stickiness amongst our users. 
In fact, through our wisdom of friends initiative, we have determined that Facebook users are approximately 27% more engaged on TripAdvisor sites and contribute roughly 2x the amount of content than the average TripAdvisor user. We continue to deepen our integration with Facebook's friends graph, having instantly personalize the trip planning experience for more than 85 million Facebook users at the end of 2011. All of this valuable data allows us to further enhance the TripAdvisor user experience and keep travelers coming back to plan their next trip.
Mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the TripAdvisor brand when users are in market. In 2011, we saw a strong user uptake, reaching an aggregate of 13 million mobile downloads and approximately 16 million monthly unique users as measured by our own log files, up from 2 million downloads and 4 million monthly unique users in 2010. 
We launched 23 mobile City Guides for Android and iOS, offering access to TripAdvisor traveler reviews, as well as suggested itineraries and offline accessible interactive walking tours. In addition to in-market functionality, we also think more people are starting their planning on mobile devices, whether in a cab on a smartphone or on the couch with an iPad or tablet. 
We saw this coming a while ago and are well-prepared technically and organizationally to take advantage of this platform shift. Our best guess is that the rise that -- the rise in the hotel shoppers on mobile devices is coming to some degree at the expense of desktop traffic growth. We've made the conscious decision to focus on growing our mobile footprint with a great product and have chosen not to monetize that platform to its full potential at this time. We expect the long-term benefits of a more engaged mobile audience to outweigh the modest amount of short-term revenue we are foregoing.
We are also expanding our footprint globally. The past year, we saw great increases in traffic in all major countries especially in the emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China. During 2011, we added points of sale in Taiwan, Malaysia and Egypt, bringing our total TripAdvisor-branded websites to 30 countries and 21 languages. These and the other newer sites in Asia-Pacific will present a terrific longer-term opportunity for the company. One of the ways that we look to penetrate new markets is to leverage our expertise in search engine marketing or SEM. In mature markets, for instance, we tend to bid SEM to maximize profit. But in emerging markets, we may bid to breakeven or at a loss in order to build our brand, gain more users to our product, collect content and to scale more quickly. 
We have a long successful history of doing this. I'll point out the obvious. In all of our SEM spend, if we buy traffic at breakeven, the margin is 0. And even when we are buying traffic on a profitable basis, it may be less than our overall margins because of the sheer amount of free traffic and domain direct traffic we get -- we naturally get, particularly in our more established points of sale. 
We think SEM is a great channel because it delivers an incredible number of brand impressions, and it's a very cost-effective method to get people to try the product. To be clear, we'd like to buy additional traffic if we can do so on a profitable basis, even if it will have a drag on margins.
In terms of content, we have over 40 million review translations, and we are committed to improving the in-country user experience and local feel for all of our points-of-sale. As a related note, when we launch a new feature, in almost all cases, it's launched simultaneously worldwide. But based on the recent comScore data, TripAdvisor has less than 10% penetration of worldwide unique travel traffic, underscoring the fact that despite being the market leader, we have a lot of global growth opportunities ahead of us.
The biggest international opportunity in front of us is China. As you know, we have 2 lead product offerings in the Chinese market, DaoDao and Kuxun, both headquartered in Beijing. Combined, we have over 225 employees in China as of the end of 2011, and we continue to invest heavily in the China market. We have been operating at a loss in China since launching DaoDao in 2009 and plan to continue investing in the business at an EBITDA loss in 2012. There's little doubt that the opportunity there is large.
Finally, we continue to like what we are seeing in our fast-growing newer subscription-based initiatives, vacation rentals and Business Listings, which are both areas of growth and investment for us. Our vacation rentals product addresses a highly fragmented $85 billion year industry according to a 2010 Radius Global Market Study. Historically, we have built our inventory through acquisitions, namely our U.S.-based FlipKey and U.K.-based Holiday Lettings businesses, but during the fourth quarter, we announced partnerships aimed at increasing our inventory. 
We believe that our nearly 200,000 properties and our highly engaged and motivated community positions us extremely well for success. We have recently bolstered the senior leadership of this product, and in 2012, we expect vacation rentals to continue to grow, benefiting from increased inventory, brand awareness and traffic to our TripAdvisor media group sites.
Our Business Listings product was created in early 2010 to allow hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent information on TripAdvisor, bringing them closer to the traveler and thereby, increasing direct bookings. In 2011, we saw nearly 80% subscriber growth reaching 35,000 Business Listing customers by the end of the year, which is still only around 6% of the site-wide hotel listings. In 2012, we are expanding our sales force in building out value-added features to upsell to this install base.
While we are pleased with the scale and diversified growth that we achieved in 2011, we are by no means satisfied. At TripAdvisor, our motto is speed wins, and our teams are focused on innovating fast and yet, sometimes failing fast, all in the spirit of improving the traveler experience, which we believe, in turn, should over the long term, enhance engagement and improve conversion rates for our clients. We have weekly releases across all points-of-sale and have recently completed a significant redesign of some of our most important pages. We're proud of what we've done in terms of improving the site experience, and we accept the consequence of lower revenue per session due to this redesign.
I can't say that we won't make a similar decision again in the future, but at this time, we're not contemplating any changes that would create a similar downward step function in revenue per hotel shopper. Regardless of whether page changes have a positive or negative near-term revenue impact, we will continue to make the necessary trade-offs to drive user growth and engagement on our site as we believe this will drive long-term shareholder value.
In summary, as we embark on 2012, we could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Before I close, I want to extend a sincere thank you to all of our TripAdvisor media group employees. Your continued dedication and hard work are greatly appreciated. Going forward, we will continue to invest in attracting, retaining and developing our world-class team. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, one of our newest additions to the executive team here at TripAdvisor, who will provide some color on the numbers and our financial outlook."

During my first 120 days on the job, I found an innovative culture coupled with strong operational focus. As you just heard in Steve's remarks, we operate a fast-moving business in a huge travel advertising market, which continues to grow with a secular shift from offline to online travel research and booking activity. 
We have a compelling business model with a strong network effect that delivers an increasingly diversified set of revenue streams across products and geographies. Our user-generated content model provides strong margins and high cash flow conversion. I'm going to outline some financial metrics that illustrate these attributes and lay out our thoughts for 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue grew 30% over the fourth quarter of 2010 to $137.8 million. For the full year 2011, revenue increased 31% over full year 2010 to $637.1 million. In terms of geography, the mix continues to diversify towards international, which more closely matches our traffic trend. As non-U.S. revenue was 40% -- 48% of total revenue this past quarter, compared to 41% in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Specifically, fourth quarter 2011 revenue was distributed 52% in the U.S., 14% in the U.K., and 34% in rest of world as measured by the website on which our ads are delivered. Note that we have a lot of international traffic that lands on tripadvisor.com, our U.S. points-of-sale and clicks through to one of our partners' international site. 
For the year, total revenue was distributed 55% in the U.S., 15% in the U.K., and 30% in rest of world. And our international revenue grew 55% year-over-year, further illustrating the exciting traction we are experiencing in our newer markets. As Steve mentioned, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets given the opportunity that we see in front of us. 
We saw strong growth across all sources of revenue for the majority of the year. However, as we expected, we did start to see growth decelerating from text link revenue in the back half of the year.  Text link revenue for the fourth quarter was up 24% year-over-year to $100 million, representing 72% of total revenue for the quarter. 
For full year 2011, text link revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $500 million and represented 79% of total revenue. Recall that this past quarter's revenue performance included the negative impact of our site redesign, which started rolling out across smaller points-of-sale at the beginning of 2011, and then completed in early Q4 after rolling out for a larger, more mature points-of-sale. 
Tying into Steve's earlier comments on merchandising metrics, the redesign improved the user experience but resulted in fewer leads to our partners. This, combined with the impact of lower CPCs from Expedia, tempered our growth in the fourth quarter. You may also recall that in Q4 2010, Google Places was promoting more heavily in the Google search results, which created an easier comp for us this past quarter compared to the first 3 quarters of 2011. Were it not for the fact that we were comping the Google Places promotion, the impact from the CPC decline and the site redesign efforts would have further dampened our Q4 growth.
Display-based advertising revenue grew 26% in Q4 to $22.9 million, up from $18.2 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2011, display-based advertising was up 19% to $85.7 million as compared to $71.9 million for the full year 2010. Display-based advertising made up 17% of total revenue for Q4 and 13% for full-year 2011, highlighting a very strong Q4 for that product. 
Subscription and other revenue also had a very strong Q4, growing over 100% from the fourth quarter of 2010 to $15.1 million. Subscription and other revenue primarily includes Business Listings and vacation rentals. For the year, subscription revenue grew 76% to $51.4 million, and billings are growing even faster as evidenced by the 60% increase in deferred revenue year-over-year. 
Subscription and other revenue made up 11% of total revenue in Q4 and 8% for full year 2011, highlighting the sequential acceleration. During the fourth quarter, revenue from Expedia was $37.5 million, up 3% year-over-year and 27% of total revenue. For the full year, revenue from Expedia was $211 million, up 23% year-over-year and 30% -- 33% of total revenue. As previously disclosed, we expected Expedia to lower its CPC pricing by approximately 10% to 15% given that they are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction -- given that we are no longer a P&L-neutral transaction for them. Our initial read is that the Expedia pricing decline is trending towards the upper end of that discount range.
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were 37% of revenue for this quarter and 32% for the year. In absolute dollars, this expense line item increased $15.5 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting our continued strategic investment in traffic acquisition and field sales initiative, both in mature markets, as well as in newer geographies. 
To reiterate Steve's earlier comments, we believe our opportunity set is immense, and we are aggressively investing to further our lead in the market globally and in adjacent products like vacation rentals and Business Listings. The majority of these investments hit the sales and marketing expense line. For 2012, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow ahead of revenue and be in the high 30s to low 40s as a percent of total annual revenue and have similar seasonality to 2011. 
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 8% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012 as we leverage our platform and remain committed to our nimble speed wins development cycle. Our non-GAAP G&A expenses, which include the related party shared service fee were 11% of revenue for the quarter and 7% for the full year, consistent with 2010. We expect this trend to continue into 2012, even after assuming additional public company costs and the obligation to fund our charitable foundation, which amounts to a contribution of approximately 2% of non-GAAP operating income.
In terms of headcount, we ended 2011 with 1,252 employees, up from 972 employees a year ago. We hired in all departments, but added disproportionately in G&A as we build out functions needed to transition away from Expedia Corporate Services. As Steve mentioned, we expect to continue to add talent to pursue our strategic initiatives in 2012 and beyond.
For the full year 2011, depreciation and amortization totaled $25.9 million or 4% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $17.3 million or 3% of revenue. For 2012, we expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011. And expect stock-based compensation expenses to increase slightly to approximately 4% of revenue.
Next, I would like to spend a moment on taxes. For the full year 2011, taxes on a GAAP basis were $94.1 million for an effective tax rate of 34.6%. There are 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate: the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and non-deductible stock compensation expense. In addition, this past year, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of certain transaction costs incurred for the spin-off from Expedia. 
In 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged to slightly lower, assuming our foreign income continues to grow at a faster pace than our domestic income and as our revenue continues to diversify globally, we expect to benefit from lower foreign taxes, specifically in the U.K. and Singapore. As it relates to non-deductible transaction costs incurred in 2011, these are onetime in nature and, therefore, will not impact 2012 results. However, we expect these benefits to be partially to fully offset by increase in state taxes. As a standalone company, a larger percentage of our earnings will be taxed in Massachusetts, our corporate headquarters, versus the lower blended rate we recorded in 2011 as part of Expedia.
GAAP net income for the quarter was up 19% year-over-year to $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share. GAAP net income for the year was up 28% to $177.7 million or $1.32 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $55.1 million, up 20% compared to the year ago quarter. For full year 2011, adjusted EBITDA was $322.9 million, up 24% compared to the prior year. 
As expected, adjusted EBITDA margins narrowed to 40% for Q4 and 51% for 2011 as compared to 43% for Q4 2010 and 54% for full year 2010 as our year-end results were negatively impacted by revenue headwinds and increased public company costs, as well as by investments in our strategic growth initiative. In addition, Q4 is typically our adjusted EBITDA margin trough as revenue in Q4 is seasonally weaker.
Cash flow from operations was $26.2 million for the quarter and $217.9 million from the full year or 19% and 34% of revenue, respectively. Cash flow from operations was 41% of revenue for full year 2010. The year-over-year decline in margin predominantly impacting Q4 was due to several spin-off-related working capital items. 
Historically, related-party revenue from Expedia was partially offset by expenses paid on TripAdvisor's behalf and settled through intercompany accounts. Going forward, Expedia receivables will be paid in the normal course, thereby, increasing cash flow from operations. Assuming minimal working capital fluctuations, cash flow from operations should track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes paid.
CapEx for 2011 came in just under 4% of revenue and is forecasted to remain in the low-single digits as a percent of revenue in 2012, validating our low capital-intensive business model. In terms of liquidity, we ended the year with $183.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We were initially capitalized with $165 million of cash immediately following the spin. We have $190 million available under a revolving credit facility. Also at the close of the spin-off, we assumed $400 million of debt, of which 100% of the proceeds were paid out as a dividend to Expedia. We plan to service that debt from our strong cash flows, and we'll continue to assess our capital structure over time.
With that, let me turn our thoughts on guidance. Given that this is our first earnings call, we want you to understand that our intent is to run TripAdvisor to create long-term shareholder value. We have a simple, yet incredibly powerful business model, built on a phenomenon of user-generated content in a lucrative online sector, travel. Our more than 60 million reviews and opinions provide a huge competitive barrier to entry, but we know that there is so much more we can do to help our travelers and earn their loyalty.
We also know that we have competitors challenging us in all markets, and we will be aggressive in our efforts to defend the best trip planning experience and retain our market leadership position. As we are ultimately focused on building the business for the long term, we will not be providing specific quarter or annual guidance.
We will, however, provide you with some qualitative thoughts on how specific actions we have taken or plan on taking extends to our 2012 financials. We expect to see continued growth in traffic and engagement. The year-over-year revenue growth will not track to traffic because of the step functions caused by the site redesign and the Expedia pricing changes. 
We currently forecast relatively flat CPC pricing on a full year basis compared to 2011. It is important to note that our forecast is very sensitive to pricing changes and that clients offer us little insight into their respective bidding strategy. Consider that on over 1 billion annual clicks, every penny in CPC pricing impacts our revenues and profit by more than $10 million. However, based on our current assumptions of a slower growth rate of hotel shoppers at the top of the funnel, as well as flat pricing, our top line text link revenue is not forecasted to grow as fast as it did in 2011. 
In our other products, we expect to see consistent growth in display advertising as compared to full year 2011. And for our subscription and other revenue, including vacation rentals and Business Listings, we forecast 2012 will be another triple-digit revenue growth year, albeit off a relatively small base. 
All in all, we expect total year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens and expect similar quarterly seasonality as compared to prior year. We recognize that our focus on this higher quality experience on both mobile and our desktop site have slowed our revenue growth, but believe that it is the right long-term strategy for the company. 
We also have such confidence in the long-term outlook for the company that even in the face of a slower revenue growth in 2012, we are continuing our investment in international expansion, including China, in addition to strategic areas such as social, mobile and vacation rentals. 
All of these newer areas either run at a loss or a lower margin compared to our core business, but we feel that each has very high potential in the years ahead. When compiling the step function that has lowered our revenue growth with our continuing investments in strategic initiatives, we forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be relatively flat to 2011 levels in terms of absolute dollars. As we lap these revenue headwinds and as the investments we've made in prior years and 2012 begin to pay off, we forecast returning to meaningful EBITDA growth in 2013. 
In closing, the fourth quarter capped a great 2011 for the company. We saw strong growth and positive trends across many of our key operating and financial metrics. Revenue continues to diversify, and margins remain healthy. We value striking a balance between growth and profitability. And currently, given that we are in the early stage of our market opportunities, we are investing for future growth globally and in adjacent products. In 2012, we expect to build upon our successes and continue to drive long-term shareholder value by making the necessary investments to accelerate growth and profitability.

So, unfortunately, we still haven't broken out for everyone the international revenue if it was measured by where the traveler lives. Because as Julie had mentioned, we do have a fair amount of traffic of folks living overseas, landing on tripadvisor.com. They speak and understand English, obviously, and we present very local commerce offerings to them, so the experience is perfectly good. We currently recognize this revenue as domestic revenue because it happens on the .com point-of-sale. Perhaps a more intuitive way of classifying it would be international revenue because the customer -- the traveler is actually living overseas, and they are -- ended up transacting on a site that's probably in their own country. When you look at it that way, it's going to be -- it's already going to swing more towards the international revenue side than the current pie chart would show. And I don't know that answer off hand, so I can't even say whether it's already a majority or not in terms of international.

On the other hand, you have the Expedia CPC issue and de-cluttering, but mid-teens seems like a bigger slowdown than what we would have thought. So is this -- what traffic assumption are you making to get to that number? And are you seeing any other advertisers bid less on the CPC side or just cut back on budgets?

It's an excellent question. I -- and we do break it down in a couple of different ways. We told you that we are projecting a modest decline in the growth in hotel shopper, so we're still obviously expecting more hotel shoppers on our points-of-sale, but the relative growth to 2011, we're expecting to be a little bit less. But part of that issue, I think, is in the U.S., we're already doing really quite well and our overseas markets, while growing quickly, aren't necessarily replacing the high growth that we had seen in, say, .com and co.uk in past years. Second up, it's just a bit hard for us to forecast. We do get a fair amount of traffic from search engines all around the globe, and the various machinations that the search engines go through either to change the search results so that it's best for whatever they think is best for their users or when they preferentially show their own traffic or their own product such as Google Places, it can have a material impacts on us. So one could fairly argue we're being a little conservative in hotel shopper growth, but it's -- but I can take the counter argument as well in that Google Places could come on a little bit stronger. And on the subject of Google Places, I want to be clear, it's not that I actually worry about Google Places as a highly competitive product to TripAdvisor today because they don't have the content. It's hard to find users that prefer that experience. But Google does continue to have the ability to preferentially show their own product over other searches or other websites like TripAdvisor. So there is that risk that stays out there in terms of Google pulling away some of the traffic that would have naturally moved over to TripAdvisor. The second part of that question was?"

No, our other advertisers and I've spoken with many leading ones are really quite excited at Expedia having pulled back on their prices. Because in many cases, they've been the beneficiary of some additional traffic as Expedia may not be the top bidder in a slot at any point. None of the advertisers of any size have even brought up the topic of budget caps because on the CPC or the text link revenue, they really all measure it on a ROI basis. They -- if we can deliver more leads at the same per unit volume -- or at the same per unit cost and if the leads stay high quality, then they'll take as many as we can send them. And it's extremely rare for a major client to say, hold off on sending the leads. The question for us in forecasting the CPCs, which again, as Julie mentioned, is quite material to us, is where are their either points-of-sale or parts of the world, where there becomes more interest in getting more leads from TripAdvisor. And everyone gets more leads when their traffic naturally rises, but in the shoulder seasons, or when there's just more competition, the bidding process will bid up, and we will benefit."

The beauty of the community is that most people just don't just write one review. We encourage them to write a second one, and then we ask them to rate something for us and give us a helpful vote on someone else's review, and it just builds more of a community, more engagement which, in turn, fuels more content. We, of course, love the content in all forms, whether it be a photo or rating, a room tip, because it makes the experience richer for the next person coming to TripAdvisor.

Scott, I'll take the first part of that question. So one thing to keep in mind that, I believe, we said on the Analyst Day when we showed our illustrative post-spin operating model that had adjusted EBITDA at the 42% to 47% range, what we were trying to do there is we had given out several pieces of information regarding things that would happen directly correlated to the spin, such as the reduction of CPCs from Expedia and also the addition of public company costs and then layered in some of our early thoughts on additional investments that were taking hold in some of those strategic areas, and we applied those changes to the 2010 financials to get at what -- a range would be -- had we had these items in 2010. So that said, things like G&A was projected much higher, but of course, we had a couple of years lapse and we have already grown into those costs. But in sales and marketing, Steve spoke in remarks a little about our philosophy for being able to buy traffic and profitability and the profit margin profile of that. And I think over time, compared with the additional revenue headwinds, which are more significant as we look at than we had originally thought at that Analyst Day, as we had noted the CPC discount from Expedia is in the top end of the range. And also, we had thought there might be some additional increases in CPCs from other OTAs that we haven't seen. There's still potential that it's coming out, but we haven't seen it yet. So that, coupled with these changes, is getting us a revised range. Steve, maybe you want to just highlight the philosophy on the SEM? Expand a bit because that is the largest change from the illustrative post-spin operating model?"

I'd like to -- I will continue to do that all day long and even go breakeven or negative in a market that I feel we need to expand to, Asia-Pacific in particular. But yes, it is the drag on margins. I'd highlight or I'd reiterate what Julie had said in terms of -- there is the issue of the site redesign, which had a bit more of an effect than we had originally projected and not all of it was fully known at that time. And then, the CPC hit from Expedia, yes, we're fine. It's a step function. It comes down to then bidding as they would as a completely independent partner -- client. And we're waiting for the dynamics to settle in and how everyone else will continue to adjust their bids. And you can appreciate how if the average price ends up just $0.01 or $0.02 higher than the flattish forecast that we've put into our plan, then that potentially drops $10 million to $20 million or more into the top and bottom lines."

We hear from our clients that the booking window is generally much less, much shorter, on the mobile, and that kind of makes sense. You're perhaps in the car or you're at a hotel one night, but you'll be in a different city the next night, and you need to go book the room and you have your mobile device as opposed your whole desktop. We're also aware that some folks may, in fact, be doing some of their research on their trusted TripAdvisor sites in mobile land because we have great apps with all the power, all the functionality. But it's mobile and a bunch of our clients are not necessarily as good as everyone would like to be and actually consummating the transaction. So maybe a little bit of what's happening is folks are exploring on mobile, doing the research, picking the hotel, and then maybe it's easier to pick up the phone and call the hotel. We see that perhaps as more of a shorter-term phenomena as mobile websites get better and better -- mobile websites of our clients, I should say, get better and better, but for us, it means that lead that the click that we send over to check the prices on the suppliers' website or an OTA may not actually get the booking, and TripAdvisor is not necessarily going to get credit for a phone transaction or a reservation made off the desktop the next day."

So our bidding strategy on the mature versus newer markets and our marketing strategy in general, is certainly to invest in the areas that are newer or younger for us. So China being an example where we're investing the most heavy, and then other Asia-Pacific countries where we might bid at a breakeven level. And if you think breakeven, it means, hey, some of the traffic we're buying were nicely profitable on because we don't have to bid up to every penny that we make. We can take profit on some terms, which means there are some other terms that we're actually bidding at a loss on. And contrast that to the U.S. or U.K. or Canada, some of our more mature markets where we really do try to make sure we're pulling in some profit on all of the terms that we bid on though as I said before, we're constantly looking for more ways to get traffic to the site.

We are very pleased with the reaction of all -- I can say this now, all of the clients that I have spoken with, with regard to the spin-off have all been uniformly viewing this as a positive event for them and for their relationship with TripAdvisor. One can actually understand how none are saying, ""Great, let me pay you more on a per unit basis now that you're different."" Everyone's always often willing to pay more if there's a corresponding meaningful lift in the traffic because we believe, in most cases, our clients are measuring the SEMs -- their SEM spend with us in much the way that we measure it with the search engines that we buy traffic from. i.e., they're trying to, in general, maximize the profit that they can pull from a channel like TripAdvisor. So if a client feels that they can increase their bid and make more money because even though it's a unit cost slightly more expensive, we're sending an incremental amount of additional volume, that's valuable to them. It drops to the bottom line. And they have a customer and a customer that they can remarket to for that booking. So -- and when we talk about our major clients, we really couldn't be happier with the reaction we received and the partners -- the dialogues continue at a more -- much more detailed level in terms of helping us help them understand the best inventory they have relative to everyone else, how the -- how our traffic can convert relative to other sources and how we can now help them optimize their spend on TripAdvisor to the mutual benefit. Whereas before, there was always -- it never happened, but there was always concern that information that another client would tell us about their most effective properties would be fuel for what Expedia would then go do with that information. So again, it didn't happen in the past, but I can certainly appreciate the concern. And everyone's well aware of the Expedia pricing decreases, and that's -- and people now feel like it's a much more level playing field. So we're very careful about never disclosing information from one client to the other, of course. But we're more than happy and are delighted with the conversations that have taken place so far that are now enabling us to help all of the other OTAs and the suppliers, be it in the most effective manner on our platform. As some may know, most of the OTAs, and I would bet many of the suppliers kind of view TripAdvisor and Google as their, by far, 2 largest platforms for acquiring cost-per-click traffic. And I'm sure if I'm in their shoes, that in deciding where the next dollar to spend is, I'm going to try to maximize my return on investment and in some cases, or in some markets that may be Google for the next click, but in an awful lot of areas, it's TripAdvisor because we can handle the volume of inventory they have, the bidding changes that they want automatically and be able to deliver them a scale that really nobody else -- in many cases, not even Google can offer. So the short answer is, they're all very pleased."

I will start by summarizing operating results for the first quarter, and then do a deeper dive on a few important developments since our last call. I'll then turn it over to Julie who will provide a more detailed look on both our financial results and our outlook. 
We had a strong start to 2012. We generated record quarterly revenue of $184 million, further extended our market leadership position in content and traffic and continued our focus on providing the best user experience possible through partnerships and optimization. Julie will provide more color on the Q1 results, but suffice it to say that our better-than-expected revenue and profit performance was driven primarily by stronger hotel shopper growth, which was up over 30% year-over-year, as well as slightly better CPC pricing. From this position of strength, we chose to reinvest some of the revenue upside to continue to pursue our long-term growth strategies. 
Driving traffic growth, both domestically and internationally, remains at the core of our strategic growth plan. With an average of over 50 million worldwide unique visitors in Q1, according to comScore data, TripAdvisor remains the largest travel site in the world. This comScore data reflects 59% year-over-year traffic growth to TripAdvisor sites. When we look at our internal logs, we see a similar growth rate but off a consistently higher unique visitor count. More importantly, it is the hotel shopper traffic, our monthly unique visitors who view a specific hotel page or listings of a hotel in the city on any TripAdvisor point-of-sale, that interests us most, as it remains the key driver of our click-based revenue stream. 
We are a global brand, as evidenced by the fact that 1/3 of our hotel shoppers are visiting tripadvisor.com. The remaining 2/3 are on TripAdvisor's international websites. However, even with our breadth and massive scale, TripAdvisor still represents less than 10% of worldwide travel unique visitors. We continue to see tremendous traffic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
I'd now like to address several other key areas for the company in the past quarter: partnerships, social and mobile. Our global partnership effort had a direct positive effect on our brand recognition, and ultimately, our traffic growth. Notably in March, we announced a content licensing partnership with Wyndham Hotel Group, who saw conversion rates increase by 30% when they integrated TripAdvisor reviews onto the wyndhamrewards.com site. In April, we announced the deepening of this partnership with TripAdvisor guest satisfaction survey in support of Wyndhams win review program, an online management tool the hotel group launched earlier this year. Reviews submitted through the survey will be available on Wyndham brand websites, as well as on TripAdvisor. This Wyndham relationship is just one example of our more than 400 content licensing partnership deals with major travel and destination sites around the world. We also have more than 50,000 smaller websites showing TripAdvisor content, including self-service badges and widgets, which are great for brand recognition. 
Regarding social, TripAdvisor is a recognized pioneer in social travel planning through our wisdom of friends initiative. By the end of Q1, we have personalized the trip planning experience for nearly 120 million Facebook users, which is up 34% since the end of 2011. Our Cities I Visit app continues to be one of the most used Facebook apps in the travel category. Generally speaking, Facebook connected users are more engaged on TripAdvisor sites as measured by page views per session and content contribution. And additionally, 1 out of every 4 reviews is written by a Facebook connected user, so we are pleased with the engagement that we've seen to date. 
One of my favorite new social features on TripAdvisor is Friend of a Friend, which allows me to tap into my Facebook friends networks for travel advice even if one of my friends hasn't left a review in the city. Through this feature, Facebook-enabled TripAdvisor users are seeing friend content 10x more than before. Users will continue to benefit from the wisdom of the crowds but our Friend of a Friend rollout is an innovative and important next step towards integrating social into the fabric of travel research in creating a more robust user experience. 
In addition to social, we continue to develop and improve our mobile offerings. We launched our SeatGuru mobile app and also announced a new HTML5 cross-platform tablet app, now available on Android and iOS. At the Mobile World Congress event in late February, we announced that a recent study dubbed TripAdvisor the second-most downloaded travel app in the App Store during 2011, behind Google Earth. This trend should continue into 2012. During the first quarter, we averaged over 25 downloads per minute and by the end of March, reach 72 million cumulative mobile app downloads, up more than 300% year-over-year. According to our internal log, we averaged more than 21 million monthly unique visitors via mobile devices in Q1, which is up nearly 200% year-over-year. Also, more than 1 million TripAdvisor City Guides were downloaded in Q1, up more than 300% since the end of 2011. 
As we think about mobile, we bifurcate between smartphone and tablet, in part due to the relative demographics of users on these devices but more so due to the richer experience on the larger screen and usage patterns for researching and booking travel. Over the past year, our smartphone app is our largest absolute grower but our tablet app is the fastest percent grower in terms of page views, sessions and unique users. Engagement increased as well, as mobile page views were up more than 250% year-over-year, driven by our smartphone app, which accounted for more than 30% of total mobile page views. We've also seen the page views per tablet app session rise more than 40% during that timeframe. 
Mobile is growing tremendously, to be sure, but we currently do not optimize for commerce, which is a conscious decision on our part given that our strategic focus centers on increasing user engagement. As such, we see smartphone sessions currently monetizing at roughly 10% to 20% of desktop, while tablet sessions are monetizing at approximately 50% to 60% of desktops. This means that tablet users, both app and tablet websites, are currently driving nearly 2/3 of our mobile revenue. Mobile is a valuable extension of the TripAdvisor platform and if we can continue to build new mobile functionality, grow our content and improve the user experience, we believe that additional revenue opportunities will follow. 
Beyond the success that we are seeing in our traffic, content, social and mobile initiatives, we've also had notable developments in our subscription-based and transaction products, business listings and vacation rentals as we continue to add to our sales and engineering teams. Specifically, our Business Listing team is executing on a very aggressive sales force hiring plan. At the simplest level, our business listing product allows businesses an easy, cost effective way to market to tourists. Our consistent, worldwide traffic growth fundamentally makes these marketing services more and more valuable each year. This team's objective is to capture this huge opportunity we have with our installed base of more than 570,000 accommodations, and down the road, the nearly 1 million restaurants and attractions that are listed on our site. We are pleased with the progress to date, and although we are slightly behind where we would like to be on hiring, we are excited not only by the strong prospects for this product in the second half of 2012 but also the longer-term opportunity that it represents. 
Finally, as you know, TripAdvisor Inc. encompasses many companies in 19 different travel brands, all of which represent different stages of the trip planning value chain. In March, our SmarterTravel subsidiary launched Tingo, an innovative hotel booking product that is complementary in many respects to their other transaction-related site Sneak Away. Tingo allows hotel shoppers to book hotels with confidence based on the fact that if the room rate drops prior to their stay, they will get the difference automatically refunded back to them. Initial feedback from customers has been quite positive and the early read on the booking window indicates that we are hitting our target audience, as customers are booking an average of 40 days out, which is significantly longer than the industry average. In summary, we're very excited about the business and the progress we are making towards our vision of helping travelers plan and have the perfect trip. I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the results and our financial outlook."
140233,183576299,294236,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on the past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems",1101,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on the past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems and delivered financial results ahead of our expectations. For the first quarter, revenue increased 23% to $184 million. Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by a in click-based revenue. Click-based revenue was up 20% to $144.9 million, significantly ahead of our expectations, primarily due to growth in hotel shoppers, and to a much lesser extent, better pricing. 
Let me take a moment to tie some of these numbers together. Click-based revenue was up 20% year-over-year on slightly better pricing, while as Steve mentioned, hotel shopper growth was up more than 30% in the same period. Most of the delta in year-over-year growth rate is due to our site redesign completed last year, which reduced comments, which said another way, reduced the number of monetization opportunities on our hotel pages. Display-based advertising grew 17% in Q1 to $21.6 million, and in line with our 2012 expectations of mid to high teens. We saw CPM prices increase slightly as compared to Q1 of last year. As discussed, we've maintained a premium price in the CPM market and therefore, have more inventory than we need. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes business listings, vacation rentals and our transactions businesses, had a strong Q1, growing 67% to $17.2 million. We set very aggressive targets for these business lines. For example, business listings originally planned to complete the sales force build out in early Q1. We are making good progress but the sales force build out is running slightly behind plan. This leads to some expense savings but also makes achieving annual revenue target for this product more challenging. However, we did see strong bookings per rep, and based on customer demand, we remain optimistic for a strong growth in 2012.
As it relates to geographic mix, our revenue continues to diversify internationally to better match our traffic. Non-U.S. revenue was 48% of total revenue this past quarter compared to 43% in the first quarter of 2011, as measured by the website on which the transactions occur. With international revenue growing roughly 3X faster than U.S. revenue, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets given the opportunity that we see in front of us in international expansion. As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.3 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than our expected annual target range of high 30s to low 40s. This is primarily due to better-than-expected revenue performance and was partially offset by some investments we made to drive traffic diversification. 
Non-GAAP expenses were $16.3 million, 9% of revenue for the quarter and in line with our expectations. We would expect this expense line to stay at a relatively consistent percent of revenue for the year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.2 million, 8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. We believe that we have completed most of our investment in public company infrastructure and expect to see leverage on this line item on an annual basis going forward. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.1 million or 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation expenses were $4.7 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. 
For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011 and expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately 4% of revenue. Our effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the quarter. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate are the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and nondeductible stock compensation expense. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we paid down the $10 million of outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility bidding, leaving us with a full $200 million available and ended the quarter with $208.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash flow from operations was $29.7 million or 16% of revenue for the quarter. As I mentioned on our last call, Expedia receivables are now paid in the normal course of business versus being netted in intercompany accounts. This change resulted in a onetime reduction in cash flow equal to the quarterly change in Expedia's receivable balance. For full year 2012, we expect cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or below 30s as a percent of revenue. Q1 CapEx was 4% of revenue. Given our capital efficient business model, we continue to expect this line to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $22.4 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q1 with just over 1,300 employees, up from just over 1,250 at the end of 2011. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are focused on engineering, sales and marketing. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook. This past quarter's revenue results exceeded our expectations as hotel shopper growth trended higher throughout the quarter and pricing was a little better-than-expected as well. However, given that we generate over 1 billion annual clicks for our clients, our forecast is extremely sensitive to even slight changes in pricing and soon, year-over-year growth rates. So of course, we are wary of extrapolating forward metrics, like hotel shopper growth and partner CPC pricing that can exhibit a high variability. However, we do expect 2012 revenue growth to trend above the midpoint of our previously provided mid-to-high teens revenue growth forecast, driven mainly by recent trends in our click-based business and partially offset by our subscription and other revenue, where we are working to catch up in our sales hiring plan. 
With regards to group, we now forecast 2012 subscription and other revenues to be a high double-digit revenue grower this year. We continue to expect supply-based advertising revenue consistent with 2011. We forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars, based on the overachievement in Q1. Should the top line continue to beat our expectation, we will likely continue to reinvest most or all of the excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts, as we believe this is in the best, long-term interest of the business. In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2012. We will now open the call to your questions."

The site redesign is all done, Expedia's had plenty of time to adjust their bids to a new world order, if you will. So Expedia, lower their pricing on the hotel clicks, but we're also sending them fewer of the photo or map clicks, which were much lower price. So net-net, the Expedia was down a bit but again, it's highly variable depending on the type of the clicks that we sent them with respect to the actual pricing. When we look at the non-Expedia revenue, obviously with Expedia staying where it is, the other clients are happily taking up the slack, the slack being additional volume. So as to bidding environment, when we move forward, the degree to which we can grow our hotel shopper traffic, we have a high degree of confidence that there are plenty of customers that are very interested in those leads in all of our points-of-sale. We like it when there's a bidding war that we can get going in certain markets or certain regions but we haven't baked in anything like that into our planning going forward."

So we're giving you the notion that, well yes, we have a lot of our traffic on the site is hotel shoppers, the growth rate on the other stuff is clearly higher because it's averaging out according to comScore at 39%. We've been clear. We don't make much money, and we certainly sell CPM ads against all the sponsorships against all of it. But the click-based revenue comes primarily from the hotel shoppers. What I alluded to at the end of my prepared remarks was that the Business Listing organization, as it has been growing, we've clearly focused it on the opportunity for hoteliers because their return on the purchase of the Business Listing is so straightforward, it's so amazing and it's relatively easy for us to reach those 500,000 hoteliers, relatively easy, compared to the 1 million restaurants and attractions, some of whom are frankly barely online. When we look out a couple of years, we project that continued growth in overall traffic, probably a higher growth in the restaurant attraction type traffic, as we have more and more tourists on our site for all sorts of things. So where we have eyeballs, we feel optimistic that we would be able to monetize them for attractions and restaurants and tour guides and other things to do once in a destination. I don't believe it will be as significant as what we can do for the hotelier but we do think both at desktop and mobile, those will become valuable eyeballs to us in the outline, in the future years, not so much 2012."

That always sorts of enhances usability and customer feedback. It's darn hard for me to tie that to the growth in hotel shoppers. We see growth across all of our significant channels, be it free search, paid search, e-mail and indirect, pretty much anything that amounts to a meaningful channel that we source, is growing and it is growing in just about every corner of the world. So international growing faster than our U.S. point-of-sale as we've otherwise shared with you. So again, across the board, probably mildly affected by, I'd say probably, it's really just a guess on my part, affected by the ongoing challenges in Southern Europe. But I can't really point to the decluttering being the reason why our traffic has grown. With regard to Google's activity, the second part of your question, we certainly see them in the search results with their hotel finder occupying the very top position for frequent, for major city hotel searches. We can't, at the moment, see a meaningful loss of traffic to us because of that. Again, that's not to say it couldn't happen in the future and it's possible that we just can't measure it well enough to know it yet and of course, they are just starting to roll that out. So we would expect more coming in that direction.

So in order, certainly we do see content growth related to overall traffic growth, the more visitors we have, this has always been true. The more visitors, the more review contributions we have and that's part of our challenge when we start in brand-new markets, where we have not a lot of traffic, we don't get a lot of reviews and we need to jumpstart that process. We've since, especially over the past 12 months or so, done a fair amount of focus on helping to reward our members with badges and such to help get them more engaged in our community, to write more reviews and we certainly have seen that pay off with higher reviews per user contribution rate. So we've proven to ourselves, at least that if you spend a little bit more time engaging with our members, we can get more content out of it. To your second question, the relative U.S. growth. So it is a little more complicated. When we looked at this and asked the same question ourselves, it is a little more complicated than on the face value. One of the things that's going on is when we look at U.S. visitors, I'll be even clearer. When we look at people who live in the U.S. and they're coming to tripadvisor.com usually, and the growth rate there is actually higher than that sort of 12% might imply. But the traffic on, but then you asked why is the traffic on tripadvisor.com isn't growing as much. And the answer is or partial answer is we have a fair amount of traffic over the past year that was coming from other English-speaking parts of the world. Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia, India, that had been ending up on tripadvisor.com and so we would count it as domestic revenue because it's off of our dot com site. We've seen very strong growth in our non-dot com English language sites recently. And so part of that delta in international growth versus U.S. growth is actually, to some degree, it's English speakers who live outside of the U.S. now going to their local point-of-sale. Now, when we were buying our traffic through SCM, we would normally buy it through the appropriate point of sale, so no change there. But Google's algorithm over the past year has changed and it's favored local points of sale more. We have lots of local points-of-sale, so the Australian citizens are now hitting TripAdvisor.com.au instead of TripAdvisor.com. You see that in international revenue going up. We see it as revenue that was on dot com moving over to Australia. From a commerce perspective, it is neutral to us because when that Australian was visiting TripAdvisor.com, they were seeing Australian commerce partners, the local OTAs in Australia anyways. So it's just the way we're measuring it ending up on different points of sale. Finally, we do have a very active sales force in all parts the world that are constantly signing up more hotel chains and more of the local OTAs. It's just the fact that whenever we have more inventory in a given country, more properties that we can have our actual prices but not activated for and more choose initial prices because we don't just have 2 OTAs. We have 4. We don't have just one supplier and one OTA, we have a supplier and 3 OTAs, we make more money. That's the choice aspect that we strive for. And in Q1, just like in prior quarters, we added more choice on newer points of sales. That improves the monetization rates. So we make a bit more money on international IPs. And I think that covered all 3 of the questions."

At this point, Kuxun is doing quite well on the flight side, certainly a strength in that part of the business as they hooked up with a lot of individual agents, as well as several OTAs to really help the clients find the better price than what they can do on other sites. And on DaoDao again, the focus remains on helping user find the best hotel and overall the best travel experience. We're starting to leverage some of our additional worldwide sales activities because there's a lot of other Western hotel companies looking to break into the China market and we're a company that they're used to dealing with. And of course, the domestic travel on the outbound trip, as everyone would tell you, is more valuable than the domestic traveler, even though much smaller number but a more valuable commodity. And we have, far and away, the most reviews of anyone when you look at the entire set of places that Chinese outbound traveler would go to.

We also did make some monetization improvements over the course of the quarter. So the hotel shoppers was a challenge to monetization of the hotel shoppers, as we were still pulling out of the site redesign and we're pleased to report that we were able to make some monetization progress, i.e. the 30% of the hotel shoppers that were visiting earlier in the quarter were converting less, and by the end of the quarter, they were stronger, so we were able to recover some of that loss. The CPC growth, I really wouldn't counsel, or I can say we are not modeling a growth in CPC over the course of the rest of the year.

The RevPAR, when the hotelier or when the OTA is making more money because of a lead we send because RevPARs have gone up, they can literally afford to spend more of that. So, if, for example, an OTA is willing to share 60% of the revenue that they make with us, just as an example, some pay more, some pay less, as that RevPAR goes up, we would see that increase. So if RevPAR is up 5%, it's fair to think of TripAdvisor deserving a 5% increase as our percentage. Do we always get that? No. That's a part of our negotiation with our sales rep and the client and it's part competition for that click, if in any particular country, hoteliers battling against an OTA for the lead, the hotelier has a lot more margin they can offer and RevPAR going up, they can offer even more. They have a bigger piece of the pie than what the OTA has and they might be able to outbid. So again, relatively straightforward correlation with RevPAR, relatively straightforward correlation with booking rates in whatever particular country. If it's a highly engaged online country that has a high online conversion rate, that's great for us as well versus a country where there's a lot of lookers but most of the actual transaction happens off-line, ergo we wouldn't get a lot of credit for those transactions, therefore client wouldn't be able to pay us a lot on a per lead basis. And the other part of your question, the continued growth in our rest of world is really a function of a lot of our initiatives and focus is around driving traffic throughout the globe, really not just in the U.S. but the fact that our U.S. and U.K. points-of-sale are really the most mature, they're the most well-known. So there's just a lot more room to attract new visitors in other markets. And I would expect that overall trend to certainly continue going forward."

I don't really recall how Expedia's CPCs may have changed Jan, Feb, March. The fact that I don't remember them being on a big upswing or downswing might lead you to fairly believe it wasn't something I was carefully watching for any particular reason. So they manage their bids carefully. Again, I can't say one thing for sure or not but it wasn't something I was focused on, certainly. Overall, again it's a bidding environment, so all the other partners are move their things up and down. And we do see a fair amount of fluctuation kind of on a weekly basis, where some are moving up and some are moving down. Our averages tend not to change all that much. To the question on business listings, so we do some simple math on I think it's 570,000 accommodations on the site and we have I think over 1/2 of them as registered owners now. And most of the registered owners are properties that have reviews. And so we qualify by properties that are popular enough to have a bunch of reviews. So the owner has probably heard of TripAdvisor because people have shown up, saying hey, I read about you on TripAdvisor. So there's some knowledge built-in. And then from memory, the different ways we tried to qualify out of that 570,000, it was well over 1/2 that the thought were perfectly reasonable folks would be interested in the business listing subscription. It might've been something closer to 3/4 of our potential and then we take out the properties that really don't have a good reputation on the assumption that most of them probably wouldn't want to pay us for something and we come up with again, well north of a couple hundred thousand viable prospects. We then look and say well, viable prospect for what? Well, we say there's a fixed annual subscription, the telephone number, the e-mail. Then there's the special offers. Then there's the placement on the mobile devices. And then there's incremental eyeballs that we might be able to offer down the road with additional marketing or advertising services. And for these properties, it's pretty hard to be able to identify an audience looking to come in a particular timeframe as we have often for a particular city that are looking for a hotel. Wow. We've got that audience. We have a person doing a search for us for a specific date in a specific city where this hotel is located. So that's already highly qualified customer and services down the road to help each of those individual hoteliers put their unique message in front of those folks. Right now, we have an annual subscription but there's nothing inherent in our business model that says it couldn't be a CPA or a CPC or a CPM additional upsell in the years to come. And then we recognize that we have a ton of additional travelers as I alluded to earlier, who they've already picked out their hotel and now they're looking for something to do or they're looking for something to do first and then they'll find a place to stay or they're trying to figure out where they want to eat when they're on that trip. And all of those have the same dynamic of it's a traveler coming into the local market that the business owner really has a tough time reaching on a timely basis. And you can think of a restaurateur who may put a two-for-one coupon in the concierge desk of a hotel and say hey, I'm willing to offer a two-for-one special to out-of-town guests who are asking the concierge at the hotel where to eat. That's a nice opportunity for the restaurant to get a customer that wasn't already a local. That wasn't already going to be eating there, i.e. the restaurant was going to be giving the two-for-one away to an existing customer. Well, that's the TripAdvisor eyeball as well. So I'm not preannouncing any product, I'm not talking about some functionality the next day but we recognize that all of the business owners who are represented on TripAdvisor and some who are not even represented in TripAdvisor now but have their product or service to sell to the traveler, TripAdvisor is a fantastic kind of media opportunity for them, and with the self-service capabilities we've built, the business listings, with the worldwide sales force, to reach the folks that aren't self-service inclined. We feel we're in a pretty good position to take advantage of those opportunities."

I will start by summarizing operating results for the first quarter, and then do a deeper dive on a few important developments since our last call. I'll then turn it over to Julie, who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook. 
We had a strong start to 2012. We generated record quarterly revenue of $184 million, further extended our market leadership position in content and traffic and continued our focus on providing the best user experience possible through partnerships and product innovation. Julie will provide more color on the Q1 results, but suffice it to say that our better-than-expected revenue and profit performance was driven primarily by stronger hotel shopper growth, which was up over 30% year-over-year, as well as slightly better CPC pricing. From this position of strength, we chose to reinvest some of the revenue upside to continue to pursue our long-term growth strategies. 
Driving traffic growth, both domestically and internationally, remains at the core of our strategic growth plan. With an average of over 50 million worldwide unique visitors in Q1, according to comScore data, TripAdvisor remains the largest travel site in the world. This comScore data reflects 59% year-over-year traffic growth to TripAdvisor sites. When we look at our internal logs, we see a similar growth rate, but of a consistently higher unique visitor count. More importantly, it is the hotel shopper traffic, our monthly unique visitors who view a specific hotel page or listings of a hotel in the city on any TripAdvisor point of sale, that interests us most, as it remains the key driver of our click-based revenue stream. 
We are a global brand, as evidenced by the fact that 1/3 of our hotel shoppers are visiting tripadvisor.com. The remaining 2/3 are on TripAdvisor's international websites. However, even with our breadth -- even with our breadth and massive scale, TripAdvisor still represents less than 10% of worldwide travel unique visitors. We continue to see tremendous traffic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
I'd now like to address several other key areas for the company in the past quarter: Partnerships, social and mobile. Our global partnership effort had a direct positive effect on our brand recognition, and ultimately, our traffic growth. Notably in March, we announced a content licensing partnership with Wyndham Hotel Group, who saw conversion rates increase by 30% when they integrated TripAdvisor reviews onto the wyndhamrewards.com site. In April, we announced the deepening of this partnership where TripAdvisor will cover guest satisfaction survey in support of Wyndhams WYN review program, an online management tool the hotel group launched earlier this year. Reviews submitted through the survey will be available on Wyndham brand websites, as well as on TripAdvisor. 
This Wyndham relationship is just one example of our more than 400 content licensing partnership deals with major travel and destination sites around the world. We also have more than 50,000 smaller websites showing TripAdvisor content, including self-service badges and widgets, which are great for brand recognition. 
Regarding social, TripAdvisor is a recognized pioneer in social travel planning through our wisdom of friends initiative. By the end of Q1, we have personalized the trip planning experience for nearly 120 million Facebook users, which is up 34% since the end of 2011. Our Cities I've Visited app continues to be one of the most-used Facebook apps in the travel category. Generally speaking, Facebook connected users are more engaged on TripAdvisor sites as measured by page views per session and content contribution. Additionally, 1 out of every 4 reviews is written by a Facebook-connected user, so we are pleased with the engagement that we've seen to date. 
One of my favorite new social features on TripAdvisor is Friend of a Friend, which allows me to tap into my Facebook friends' networks for travel advice even if one of my friends hasn't left a review in the city. Through this feature, Facebook-enabled TripAdvisor users are seeing friend content 10x more than before. The user will continue to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd, but our Friend of a Friend rollout is an innovative and important next step towards integrating social into the fabric of travel research in creating a more robust user experience. 
In addition to social, we continue to develop and improve our mobile offerings. We launched our SeatGuru mobile app and also announced a new HTML5 cross-platform tablet app, now available on Android and iOS. At the Mobile World Congress event in late February, we announced that a recent Distimo study dubbed TripAdvisor the second most downloaded travel app in the App Store during 2011, behind Google Earth. This trend should continue into 2012. During the first quarter, we averaged over 25 downloads per minute, and by the end of March, reach 17 million cumulative mobile app downloads, up more than 300% year-over-year. According to our internal log, we averaged more than 21 million monthly unique visitors via mobile devices in Q1, which is up nearly 200% year-over-year. Also, more than 1 million TripAdvisor City Guides were downloaded in Q1, up more than 300% since the end of 2011. 
As we think about mobile, we bifurcate between smartphone and tablet, in part due to the relative demographics of users on these devices, but more so due to the richer experience on the larger screen and usage patterns for researching and booking travel. Over the past year, our smartphone app is our largest absolute grower, but our tablet app is the fastest percent grower in terms of page views, sessions and unique users. Engagement increased as well, as mobile page views were up more than 250% year-over-year, driven by our smartphone app, which accounted for more than 30% of total mobile page views. We have also seen the page views per tablet app session rise more than 40% during that time frame. 
Mobile is growing tremendously, to be sure, but we currently do not optimize for commerce, which is a conscious decision on our part, given that our strategic focus centers on increasing user engagement. As such, we see smartphone sessions currently monetizing at roughly 10% to 20% of desktop, while tablet sessions are monetizing at approximately 50% to 60% of desktop. This means that tablet users, both app and tablet websites, are currently driving nearly 2/3 of our mobile revenue. Mobile is a valuable extension of the TripAdvisor platform, and if we can continue to build new mobile functionality, grow our content and improve the user experience, we believe that additional revenue opportunities will follow. 
Beyond the success that we are seeing in our traffic, content, social and mobile initiatives, we have also had notable developments in our subscription-based and transaction products, business listings and vacation rentals as we continue to add to our sales and engineering teams. Specifically, our Business Listing team is executing on a very aggressive sales force hiring plan. At the simplest level, our business listing product allows businesses an easy, cost effective way to market to tourists. Our consistent, worldwide traffic growth fundamentally makes these marketing services more and more valuable each year. This team's objective is to capture this huge opportunity we have with our installed base of more than 570,000 accommodations, and down the road, the nearly 1 million restaurants and attractions that are listed on our site. We are pleased with the progress to date, and although we are slightly behind where we would like to be on hiring, we are excited not only by the strong prospects for this product in the second half of 2012, but also the longer-term opportunity that it represents. 
Finally, as you know, TripAdvisor, Inc. encompasses many companies in 19 different travel brands, all of which represent different stages of the trip planning value chain. In March, our SmarterTravel subsidiary launched Tingo, an innovative hotel booking product that is complementary in many respects to their other transaction-related site, SniqueAway. Tingo allows hotel shoppers to book hotels with confidence based on the fact that if the room rate drops prior to their stay, they will get the difference automatically refunded back to them. Initial feedback from customers has been quite positive, and the early read on the booking window indicates that we are hitting our target audience, as customers are booking an average of 40 days out, which is significantly longer than the industry average. 
In summary, we're very excited about the business and the progress we are making towards our vision of helping travelers plan and have the perfect trip. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the results and our financial outlook."
140233,183576299,294413,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on our past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems",1112,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on our past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems and delivered financial results ahead of our expectations. For the first full quarter, revenue increased -- for the first quarter, revenue increased 23% to $184 million. Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by a fad click-based revenue. Click-based revenue was up 20% to $144.9 million, significantly ahead of our expectations, primarily due to growth in hotel shoppers, and to a much lesser extent, better pricing. 
Let me take a moment to tie some of these numbers together. Click-based revenue was up 20% year-over-year on slightly better pricing, while as Steve mentioned, hotel shopper growth was up more than 30% in the same period. Most of the delta in year-over-year growth rate is due to our site redesign completed last year, which reduced comments, or said another way, reduced the number of monetization opportunities on our hotel pages. 
Display-based advertising grew 17% in Q1 to $21.6 million, and in line with our 2012 expectations of mid- to high teens. We saw CPM prices increase slightly as compared to Q1 of last year. As discussed, we've maintained a premium price in the CPM market and therefore, have more inventory than we need. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, Vacation Rentals and our Transactions businesses, had a strong Q1, growing 67% to $17.2 million. We set very aggressive targets for these business lines. For example, Business Listings originally planned to complete the sales force build out in early Q1. We are making good progress, but the sales force build-out is running slightly behind plan. This leads to some expense savings, but also makes achieving annual revenue target for this product more challenging. However, we did see strong bookings per rep, and based on customer demand, we remain optimistic for a strong growth in 2012.
As it relates to geographic mix, our revenue continues to diversify internationally to better match our traffic. Non-U.S. revenue was 48% of total revenue this past quarter compared to 43% in the first quarter of 2011, as measured by the website on which the transactions occur. With international revenue growing roughly 3x faster than U.S. revenue, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets, given the opportunity that we see in front of us in international expansion. 
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.3 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than our expected annual target range of high 30s to low 40s. This is primarily due to better-than-expected revenue performance and was partially offset by some investments we made to drive traffic diversification. 
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $16.3 million, 9% of revenue for the quarter and in line with our expectations. We would expect this expense line to stay at a relatively consistent percent of revenue for the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.2 million, 8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. We believe that we have completed most of our investment in public company infrastructure and expect to see leverage on this line item on an annual basis going forward. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.1 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $4.7 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. 
For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011 and expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the quarter. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate are the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and nondeductible stock compensation expense. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. 
In terms of liquidity, we paid down the $10 million of outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility, leaving us with a full $200 million available and ended the quarter with $208.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash flow from operations was $29.7 million or 16% of revenue for the quarter. As I mentioned on our last call, Expedia receivables are now paid in the normal course of business versus being netted in intercompany accounts. This change resulted in a onetime reduction in cash flow equal to the quarterly change in Expedia's receivable balance. For full year 2012, we expect cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or below 30s as a percent of revenue. 
Q1 CapEx was 4% of revenue. Given our capital efficient business model, we continue to expect this line to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $22.4 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q1 with just over 1,300 employees, up from just over 1,250 at the end of 2011. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are focused on engineering, sales and marketing. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook. This past quarter's revenue results exceeded our expectations as hotel shopper growth trended higher throughout the quarter and pricing was a little better-than-expected as well. However, given that we generate over 1 billion annual clicks for our clients, our forecast is extremely sensitive to even slight changes in pricing and soon, year-over-year growth rates. So of course, we are wary of extrapolating forward metrics, like hotel shopper growth and partner CPC pricing that can exhibit such high variability. However, we do expect 2012 revenue growth to trend above the midpoint of our previously provided mid-to high teens revenue growth forecast, driven mainly by recent trends in our click-based business and partially offset by our subscription and other revenue, where we are working to catch up in our sales hiring plan. 
With regards to latter group, we now forecast 2012 subscription and other revenues to be a high double-digit revenue grower this year. We continue to expect display-based advertising revenue consistent with 2011. We forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars, based on the overachievement in Q1. Should the top line continue to beat our expectation, we will likely continue to reinvest most or all of the excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts, as we believe this is in the best, long-term interest of the business. 
In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2012. We will now open the call to your questions."

Are all the CPC initiatives and de-cluttering fully baked in that number? Or is it jus a new kind of established run rate at kind of down 4% year-over-year?

The site redesign is all done, Expedia's had plenty of time to adjust their bids to a new world order, if you will. So Expedia, lowered their pricing on the hotel clicks, but we're also sending them fewer of the photo or map clicks, which were much lower priced. So net-net, the Expedia rev was down a bit, but again, it's highly variable depending on the type of the clicks that we sent them with respect to the actual pricing. When we look at the non-Expedia revenue, obviously with Expedia staying where it is, the other clients are happily taking up the slack, the slack being additional volume. So as a bidding environment, when we move forward, the degree to which we can grow our hotel shopper traffic, we have a high degree of confidence that there are plenty of customers very interested in those leads in all of our points of sale. We like it when there's a bidding war that we can get going in certain markets or at certain regions, but we haven't baked in anything like that into our planning going forward."

So we're giving you the notion that, well yes, we have a lot of our traffic on the site is hotel shoppers, the growth rate on the other stuff is clearly higher because it's averaging out according to comScore at 39%. We've been clear. We don't make much money, and we certainly sell CPM ads against all that and some sponsorships against all of it, but the click-based revenue comes primarily from the hotel shoppers. What I alluded to at the end of my prepared remarks was that the Business Listing organization, as it has been growing, we've clearly focused it on the opportunity for hoteliers because their return on the purchase of the Business Listing is so straightforward, it's so amazing and it's relatively easy for us to reach those 500,000 hoteliers, relatively easy, compared to the 1 million restaurants and attractions, some of whom are frankly, barely online. When we look out a couple of years, we see -- we project that continued growth in overall traffic, probably a higher growth in the restaurant attraction-type traffic, as we have more and more tourists on our site for all sorts of things. So where we have eyeballs, we feel optimistic that we would be able to monetize them for attractions and restaurants and tour guides and other things to do once in destination. I don't believe it will be as significant as what we can do for the hotelier, but we do think both on desktop and mobile, that those will become valuable eyeballs to us in the outlying -- in the future years, not so much 2012."

That always sorts of enhances usability and customer feedback. It's darn hard for me to tie that to the growth in hotel shoppers. We see growth across all of our significant channels, be it free search, paid search, e-mails, domain direct, pretty much anything that amounts to a meaningful channel that we source, is growing and is growing in just about every corner of the world, so international growing faster than our U.S. point of sale as we've otherwise shared with you.

We can't, at the moment, see a meaningful loss of traffic to us because of that.

So in order, I -- certainly we do see content growth related to overall traffic growth, the more visitors we have, this has always been true. The more visitors, the more review contributions we have",642,"Good questions. I'd tried to take note as we went along. So in order, I -- certainly we do see content growth related to overall traffic growth, the more visitors we have, this has always been true. The more visitors, the more review contributions we have and that's part of our challenge when we start in brand new markets, where we have not a lot of traffic, we don't get a lot of reviews and we need to jumpstart that process. We've since, especially over the past -- essentially over the past 12 months or so, done a fair amount of focus on helping to reward our members with badges and such to help get them more engaged in our community, to write more reviews and we certainly have seen that pay off with higher reviews per user contribution rates. So we've proven to ourselves, at least that if we spend a little bit more time engaging with our members, we can get more content out of it. To your second question, the relative U.S. growth, so it is a little more complicated. But when we looked at this and asked the same question ourselves, it is a little more complicated than on the face value. One of the things that's going on is when we look at U.S. visitors, people -- sorry, I'll be even clearer. When we look at people who live in the U.S. and they're coming to tripadvisor.com usually, and the growth rate there is actually higher than that sort of 12% might imply. But the traffic on, but then you asked why is the traffic on tripadvisor.com isn't growing as much. And the answer is, or partial answer is we have a fair amount of traffic over the past year that was coming from other English-speaking parts of the world: Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia, India, that had been ending up on tripadvisor.com, and so we would count it as domestic revenue because it's off of our dot com site. We've seen very strong growth in our non-dot com English language sites recently. And so part of that delta in international growth versus U.S. growth is actually, to some degree, it's English speakers who live outside of the U.S. now going to their local point of sale. Now when we were buying our traffic through SEM, we would normally buy it to the appropriate point of sale, so no change there. But Google's algorithm over the past year has changed and has favored local points of sale more, we have lots of local points of sale, so the Australian citizens are now hitting tripadvisor.com.au instead of tripadvisor.com. You see that in international revenue going up. We see it as revenue that was on dot com moving over to Australia. From a commerce perspective, it is neutral to us because when that Australian was visiting tripadvisor.com, they were seeing Australian commerce partners, the local OTAs in Australia anyways. So it's just the way we're measuring it ends up on different points of sale. Finally, we do have a very active sales force in all parts the world that are constantly signing up more hotel chains and more of the local OTAs. It's just the fact that whenever we have more inventory in a given country, more properties that we can have our show prices button-activated for and more choice initial prices because we don't just have 2 OTAs. We have 4. We don't have just one supplier and 1 OTA, we have a supplier and 3 OTAs, we make more money. That's the choice aspect that we strive for. And in Q1, just like in prior quarters, we added more choice on newer points-of-sales. That improves the monetization rates. So we make a bit more money on international IPs. And I think that covered all 3 of the questions"

At this point, Kuxun is doing quite well on the flight side. Certainly, a strength in that part of the business as they've hooked up with a lot of individual agents, as well as several OTAs to really help the clients find the better price than what they can do on other sites. And on DaoDao, again, the focus remains on helping the user find the best hotel and overall the best travel experience. We're starting to leverage some of our additional worldwide sales activities because there's a lot of other western hotel companies looking to break into the China market, and we're a company that they're used to dealing with. And of course, the domestic traveler on the outbound trip, as everyone would tell you, is more valuable than the domestic traveler, even though much smaller number, but a more valuable commodity. And we have, far and away, the most reviews of anyone when you look at the entire set of places that the Chinese outbound traveler would go to. So we remain optimistic, but not a lot of detail I can report in terms of progress."

So I don't have off hand kind of the monthly image of the hotel shopper growth last year. I do recall our February call, where it was looking a lot darker at that time, when we were looking at our January hotel shopper growth. So January was a tougher start when we looked at the overall numbers as best we could tell. And then the quarter looked like the quarter did get better. We also did make some monetization improvements over the course of the quarter. So the hotel shoppers was a challenge to monetization of the hotel shoppers, as we were still pulling out of the site redesign. And we're pleased to report that we were able to make some monetization progress, i.e. the 30% of the hotel shoppers that we're visiting earlier in the quarter were converting less, and by the end of the quarter, they were stronger, so we were able to recover some of that loss. The CPC growth, I really wouldn't counsel, or I can say, we are not modeling a growth in CPC over the course of the rest of the year. And again, it's a bidding model, as I've said, but we'd be quite uncomfortable assuming a price increase as we look forward."

The RevPAR, when the hotelier or when the OTA is making more money because of a lead we send because RevPARs have gone up, they can literally afford to spend more of that. So if, for example, an OTA is willing to share 60% of the revenue that they make with us, just as an example, some pay more, some pay less, as that RevPAR goes up, we would see that increase. So if RevPAR is up 5%, it's fair to think of TripAdvisor deserving a 5% increase as our percentage. Do we always get that? No. That's a part of a negotiation with our sales rep and the client and it's part competition for that click, if in any particular country, hoteliers battling against an OTA for the lead, the hotelier has a lot more margin they can offer and RevPAR going up, they can offer even more. They have a bigger piece of the pie than what the OTA has and they might be able to outbid. So again, relatively straightforward correlation with RevPAR, relatively straightforward correlation with booking rates in whatever particular country. If it's a highly engaged online country that has a high online conversion rate, that's great for us as well versus a country where there's a lot of lookers but most of the actual transaction happens offline, ergo we wouldn't get a lot of credit for those transactions, therefore client wouldn't be able to pay us a lot on a per-lead basis. Our -- to the other of your part of your question, the continued growth in our rest of world is really a function of a lot of our initiatives, and focus is around driving traffic throughout the globe, really not just in the U.S., but the fact that our U.S. and U.K. points of sale are really the most mature, they're the most well-known. So there's just a lot more room to attract new visitors in other markets. And I would expect that overall trend to certainly continue going forward."

I don't really recall how Expedia's CPCs may have changed Jan, Feb, March. The fact that I don't remember them being on a big upswing or downswing might lead you to fairly believe it wasn't something I was carefully watching for any particular reason. So they manage their bids carefully. Again, I can't say one thing for sure or not, but it wasn't something I was focused on, certainly. Overall, again, it's a bidding environment, so all the other partners are move their things up and down. And we do see a fair amount of fluctuation kind of on a weekly basis, where some are moving up and some were moving down. Our averages tend not to change all that much. To the question on Business Listings, so we do some simple math on the -- I think it's 570,000 accommodations on the site, and we have I think over half of them as registered owners now. And most of the registered owners are properties that have reviews. And so we qualify by properties that are popular enough to have a bunch of reviews. So the owner has probably heard of TripAdvisor because people have shown up, saying, ""Hey, I read about you on TripAdvisor."" So there's some knowledge built-in. And then from memory the different ways we tried to qualify out of that 570,000, it was well over half that we thought were perfectly reasonable folks would be interested in the business listing subscription. It might have been something closer to 3/4 who have potential and then we take out the properties that really don't have a good reputation on the assumption that most of them probably wouldn't want to pay us for something. And we come up with again, well north of a couple hundred thousand viable prospects. When we then look and say, ""Well, viable prospect for what:"" Well, we say, "" There's a fixed annual subscription, the telephone number, the e-mail. Then there's the special offers. Then there's the placement on the mobile devices. And then there's incremental eyeballs that we might be able to offer down the road with additional marketing or advertising services."" And for these properties, it's pretty hard to be able to identify an audience looking to come in a particular time frame because we have date seat [ph] often for a particular city that are looking for a hotel. Wow, we've got that audience. We have the person doing a search for a specific date in a specific city where this hotel is located. So that's already a highly qualified customer and services down the road to help each of those individual hoteliers put their unique message in front of those folks. Right now, we have an annual subscription, but there's nothing inherent in our business model that says it couldn't be a CPA or a CPC or a CPM additional upsell in the years to come. And then we recognize that we have a ton of additional travelers, as I alluded to earlier, who they've already picked out their hotel and now they're looking for something to do or they're looking for something to do first and then they'll find a place to stay or they're trying to figure out where they want to eat when they're on that trip. And all of those have the same dynamic of it's a traveler coming into the local market that the business owner really has a tough time reaching on a timely -- in a timely basis. And you can think of a restaurateur who may put a 2-for-1 coupon in the concierge desk of a hotel and say, ""Hey, I'm willing to offer a 2-for-1 special to out-of-town guests, who are asking the concierge at the hotel where to eat. That's a nice opportunity for the restaurant to get a customer that wasn't already a local. That wasn't already going to be eating there, i.e. the restaurant was going to be giving the 2-for-1 away to an existing customer. Well that's the TripAdvisor eyeball as well. So I'm not preannouncing any product. I'm not talking about some functionality the next day, but we recognize that all of the business owners who are represented on TripAdvisor and some who aren't even represented on TripAdvisor now, but have a product or service to sell to the traveler, that TripAdvisor is a fantastic kind of media opportunity for them, and with the self-service capabilities we've built, the Business Listings, with the worldwide sales force, to reach the folks that aren't self-service inclined. We feel we're in a pretty good position to take advantage of those opportunities."

I will start by summarizing operating results for the first quarter, and then do a deeper dive on a few important developments since our last call. I'll then turn it over to Julie, who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook. 
We had a strong start to 2012. We generated record quarterly revenue of $184 million, further extended our market leadership position in content and traffic and continued our focus on providing the best user experience possible through partnerships and product innovation. Julie will provide more color on the Q1 results, but suffice it to say that our better-than-expected revenue and profit performance was driven primarily by stronger hotel shopper growth, which was up over 30% year-over-year, as well as slightly better CPC pricing. From this position of strength, we chose to reinvest some of the revenue upside to continue to pursue our long-term growth strategies. 
Driving traffic growth, both domestically and internationally, remains at the core of our strategic growth plan. With an average of over 50 million worldwide unique visitors in Q1, according to comScore data, TripAdvisor remains the largest travel site in the world. This comScore data reflects 39% year-over-year traffic growth to TripAdvisor sites. When we look at our internal logs, we see a similar growth rate, but off a consistently higher unique visitor count. More importantly, it is the hotel shopper traffic, our monthly unique visitors who view a specific hotel page or listings of a hotel in a city on any TripAdvisor point of sale, that interests us most, as it remains the key driver of our click-based revenue stream. 
We are a global brand, as evidenced by the fact that 1/3 of our hotel shoppers are visiting tripadvisor.com. The remaining 2/3 are on TripAdvisor's international websites. However, with the breadth -- even with our breadth and massive scale, TripAdvisor still represents less than 10% of worldwide travel unique visitors. We continue to see tremendous traffic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
I'd now like to address several other key areas for the company in the past quarter: partnerships, social and mobile. Our global partnership effort had a direct positive effect on our brand recognition, and ultimately, our traffic growth. Notably in March, we announced a content licensing partnership with Wyndham Hotel Group, who saw conversion rates increase by 30% when they integrated TripAdvisor reviews onto the wyndhamrewards.com site. In April, we announced the deepening of this partnership where TripAdvisor will power a guest satisfaction survey in support of Wyndham's WYN review program, an online management tool the hotel group launched earlier this year. Reviews submitted through the survey will be available on Wyndham brand websites, as well as on TripAdvisor. 
This Wyndham relationship is just one example of our more than 400 content licensing partnership deals with major travel and destination sites around the world. We also have more than 50,000 smaller websites showing TripAdvisor content, including self-service badges and widgets, which are great for brand recognition. 
Regarding social, TripAdvisor is a recognized pioneer in social travel planning through our wisdom of friends initiative. By the end of Q1, we had personalized the trip planning experience for nearly 120 million Facebook users, which is up 34% since the end of 2011. Our Cities I've Visited app continues to be one of the most-used Facebook apps in the travel category. Generally speaking, Facebook-connected users are more engaged on TripAdvisor sites as measured by page views per session and content contribution. Additionally, 1 out of every 4 reviews is written by a Facebook-connected user, so we are pleased with the engagement that we've seen to date. 
One of my favorite new social features on TripAdvisor is Friend of a Friend, which allows me to tap into my Facebook friends' networks for travel advice even if one of my friends hasn't left a review in a city. Through this feature, Facebook-enabled TripAdvisor users are seeing friend content 10x more than before. The users will continue to benefit from the wisdom of the crowds, but our Friend of a Friend rollout is an innovative and important next step towards integrating social into the fabric of travel research in creating a more robust user experience. 
In addition to social, we continue to develop and improve our mobile offerings. We launched our SeatGuru mobile app and also announced a new HTML5 cross-platform tablet app, now available on Android and iOS. At the Mobile World Congress event in late February, we announced that a recent Distimo study dubbed TripAdvisor the second most downloaded travel app in the App Store during 2011, behind Google Earth. This trend should continue into 2012. During the first quarter, we averaged over 25 downloads per minute, and by the end of March, reached 17 million cumulative mobile app downloads, up more than 300% year-over-year. According to our internal log, we averaged more than 21 million monthly unique visitors via mobile devices in Q1, which is up nearly 200% year-over-year. Also, more than 1 million TripAdvisor City Guides were downloaded in Q1, up more than 300% since the end of 2011. 
As we think about mobile, we bifurcate between smartphone and tablet, in part due to the relative demographics of users on these devices, but more so due to the richer experience on the larger screen and usage patterns for researching and booking travel. Over the past year, our smartphone app is our largest absolute grower, but our tablet app is the fastest percent grower in terms of page views, sessions and unique users. Engagement increased as well, as mobile page views were up more than 250% year-over-year, driven by our smartphone app, which accounted for more than 30% of total mobile page views. We have also seen the page views per tablet app session rise more than 40% during that time frame. 
Mobile is growing tremendously, to be sure, but we currently do not optimize for commerce, which is a conscious decision on our part, given that our strategic focus centers on increasing user engagement. As such, we see smartphone sessions currently monetizing at roughly 10% to 20% of desktop, while tablet sessions are monetizing at approximately 50% to 60% of desktop. This means that tablet users, both app and tablet websites, are currently driving nearly 2/3 of our mobile revenue. Mobile is a valuable extension of the TripAdvisor platform, and if we can continue to build new mobile functionality, grow our content and improve the user experience, we believe that additional revenue opportunities will follow. 
Beyond the success that we are seeing in our traffic, content, social and mobile initiatives, we have also had notable developments in our subscription-based and transaction products, business listings and vacation rentals as we continue to add to our sales and engineering teams. Specifically, our Business Listing team is executing on a very aggressive sales force hiring plan. At the simplest level, our Business Listing product allows businesses an easy, cost effective way to market to tourists. Our consistent, worldwide traffic growth fundamentally makes these marketing services more and more valuable each year. This team's objective is to capture this huge opportunity we have with our installed base of more than 570,000 accommodations, and down the road, the nearly 1 million restaurants and attractions that are listed on our site. We are pleased with the progress to date, and although we are slightly behind where we would like to be on hiring, we are excited not only by the strong prospects for this product in the second half of 2012, but also the longer-term opportunity that it represents. 
Finally, as you know, TripAdvisor, Inc. encompasses many companies in 19 different travel brands, all of which represent different stages of the trip planning value chain. In March, our SmarterTravel subsidiary launched Tingo, an innovative hotel booking product that is complementary in many respects to their other transaction-oriented site, SniqueAway. Tingo allows hotel shoppers to book hotels with confidence based on the fact that if the room rate drops prior to their stay, they will get the difference automatically refunded back to them. Initial feedback from customers has been quite positive, and the early read on the booking window indicates that we are hitting our target audience, as customers are booking an average of 40 days out, which is significantly longer than the industry average. 
In summary, we're very excited about the business and the progress we are making towards our vision of helping travelers plan and have the perfect trip. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the results and our financial outlook."
140233,183576299,294538,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on this past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems",1115,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on this past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems and delivered financial results ahead of our expectations. For the first full quarter, revenue increased -- for the first quarter, revenue increased 23% to $184 million. Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by a fad click-based revenue. Click-based revenue was up 20% to $144.9 million, significantly ahead of our expectations, primarily due to growth in hotel shoppers, and to a much lesser extent, better pricing. 
Let me take a moment to tie some of these numbers together. Click-based revenue was up 20% year-over-year on slightly better pricing, while as Steve mentioned, hotel shopper growth was up more than 30% in the same period. Most of the delta in year-over-year growth rate is due to our site redesign completed last year, which reduced comments, or said another way, reduced the number of monetization opportunities on our hotel pages. 
Display-based advertising grew 17% in Q1 to $21.6 million, and in line with our 2012 expectations of mid to high teens. We saw CPM prices increase slightly as compared to Q1 of last year. As discussed, we've maintained a premium price in the CPM market and therefore, have more inventory than we need. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, Vacation Rentals and our Transactions businesses, had a strong Q1, growing 67% to $17.2 million. We set very aggressive targets for these business lines. For example, Business Listings originally planned to complete the sales force build out in early Q1. We are making good progress, but the sales force build-out is running slightly behind plan. This leads to some expense savings, but also makes achieving annual revenue targets for this product more challenging. However, we did see strong bookings per rep, and based on customer demand, we remain optimistic for a strong growth in 2012.
As it relates to geographic mix, our revenue continues to diversify internationally to better match our traffic. Non-U.S. revenue was 48% of total revenue this past quarter compared to 43% in the first quarter of 2011, as measured by the website on which the transactions occur. With international revenue growing roughly 3x faster than U.S. revenue, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets, given the opportunity that we see in front of us in international expansion. 
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.3 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than our expected annual target range of high 30s to low 40s. This is primarily due to better-than-expected revenue performance and was partially offset by some investments we made to drive traffic diversification. 
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $16.3 million, 9% of revenue for the quarter and in line with our expectations. We would expect this expense line to stay at a relatively consistent percent of revenue for the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.2 million, 8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. We believe that we have completed most of our investment in public company infrastructure and expect to see leverage on this line item on an annual basis going forward. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.1 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $4.7 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. 
For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011 and expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the quarter. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate are the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and nondeductible stock compensation expense. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. 
In terms of liquidity, we paid down the $10 million of outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility, leaving us with a full $200 million available and ended the quarter with $208.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash flow from operations was $29.7 million or 16% of revenue for the quarter. As I mentioned on our last call, Expedia receivables are now paid in the normal course of business versus being netted in intercompany accounts. This change resulted in a onetime reduction in cash flow equal to the quarterly change in Expedia's receivable balance. For full year 2012, we expect cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or below 30s as a percent of revenue. 
Q1 CapEx was 4% of revenue. Given our capital efficient business model, we continue to expect this line to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $22.4 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q1 with just over 1,300 employees, up from just over 1,250 at the end of 2011. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are focused on engineering, sales and marketing. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook. This past quarter's revenue results exceeded our expectations as hotel shopper growth trended higher throughout the quarter and pricing was a little better than expected as well. However, given that we generate over 1 billion annual clicks for our clients, our forecast is extremely sensitive to even slight changes in pricing and soon, year-over-year growth rates. So of course, we are wary of extrapolating forward metrics, like hotel shopper growth and partner CPC pricing that can exhibit such high variability. However, we do expect 2012 revenue growth to trend above the midpoint of our previously provided mid to high teens revenue-growth forecast, driven mainly by recent trends in our click-based business and partially offset by our subscription and other revenue, where we are working to catch up in our sales hiring plans. 
With regards to the latter group, we now forecast 2012 subscription and other revenues to be a high double-digit revenue grower this year. We continue to expect display-based advertising revenue consistent with 2011. We forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars, based on the overachievement in Q1. Should the top line continue to beat our expectation, we will likely continue to reinvest most or all of the excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts, as we believe this is in the best, long-term interest of the business. 
In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2012. We will now open the call to your questions."

So your revenue from Expedia came in at only down 4% year-on-year, much better than, I think, what we had talked about last quarter. So I just wanted to get a little color there. Are all the CPC initiatives and de-cluttering fully baked in that number? Or is it just a new kind of established run rate at kind of down 4% year-on-year? And then a question on the non-Expedia customers of yours. That spend was up about almost 40% year-on-year. Do you think that could see some acceleration as some of your non-Expedia advertisers get more aggressive throughout 2012 or versus the right run rate?"

The site redesign is all done, Expedia's had plenty of time to adjust their bids to the new world order, if you will. So Expedia lowered their pricing on the hotel clicks, but we're also sending them fewer of the photo or map clicks, which were much lower priced. So net-net, the Expedia rev was down a bit, but again, it's highly variable depending on the type of the clicks that we sent them with respect to the actual pricing. When we look at the non-Expedia revenue, obviously with Expedia staying where it is, the other clients are happily taking up the slack, the slack being additional volume. So as a bidding environment, when we move forward, the degree to which we can grow our hotel shopper traffic, we have a high degree of confidence that there are plenty of customers very interested in those leads in all of our points of sale. We like it when there's a bidding war that we can get going in certain markets or at certain regions, but we haven't baked in anything like that into our planning going forward."

So we're giving you the notion that, well yes, we have a lot of our traffic on the site is hotel shoppers, the growth rate on the other stuff is clearly higher because it's averaging out according to comScore at 39%. We've been clear. We don't make much money, and we certainly sell CPM ads against all of it and some sponsorships against all of it, but the click-based revenue comes primarily from the hotel shoppers. What I alluded to at the end of my prepared remarks was that the Business Listing organization, as it has been growing, we've clearly focused it on the opportunity for hoteliers because their return on the purchase of the Business Listing is so straightforward, it's so amazing and it's relatively easy for us to reach those 500,000 hoteliers, relatively easy, compared to the 1 million restaurants and attractions, some of whom are frankly, barely online. When we look out a couple of years, we see -- we project a continued growth in overall traffic, probably a higher growth in the restaurant attraction-type traffic, as we have more and more tourists on our site for all sorts of things. So where we have eyeballs, we feel optimistic that we would be able to monetize them for attractions and restaurants and tour guides and other things to do once in destination. I don't believe it will be as significant as what we can do for the hotelier, but we do think both on desktop and mobile, that those will become valuable eyeballs to us in the outlying -- in the future years, not so much 2012."

That always sorts of enhances usability and customer feedback. It's darn hard for me to tie that to the growth in hotel shoppers. We see growth across all of our significant channels, be it free search, paid search, e-mail, domain direct, pretty much anything that amounts to a meaningful channel that we source, is growing and is growing in just about every corner of the world, so international growing faster than our U.S. point of sale as we've otherwise shared with you. So again, across the board, probably mildly affected by -- I say probably, it's really just a guess on my part -- affected by the ongoing challenges in Southern Europe. But I can't really point to the de-cluttering being the reason why our traffic has grown. With regard to Google's activity, the second part of your question, we certainly see them in the search results with their hotel finder occupying the very top position for frequent -- for major city hotel searches. We can't, at the moment, see a meaningful loss of traffic to us because of that. Again, that's not to say it couldn't happen in the future, and it's possible that we just can't measure it well enough to note it yet, and of course, they're just starting to roll that out.

So in order, certainly we do see content growth related to overall traffic growth. The more visitors we have, this has always been true. The more visitors, the more review contributions we have and that's part of our challenge when we start in brand new markets, where we have not a lot of traffic, we don't get a lot of reviews and we need to jumpstart that process. We've since, especially over the past -- essentially over the past 12 months or so, done a fair amount of focus on helping to reward our members with badges and such to help get them more engaged in our community, to write more reviews and we certainly have seen that pay off with higher reviews per user contribution rate. So we've proven to ourselves, at least, that if we spend a little bit more time engaging with our members, we can get more content out of it. To your second question, the relative U.S. growth, so it is a little more complicated. But when we looked at this and asked the same question ourselves, it is a little more complicated than on the face value. One of the things that's going on is when we look at U.S. visitors, people -- sorry, I'll be even clearer. When we look at people who live in the U.S. and they're coming to tripadvisor.com usually, and the growth rate there is actually higher than that sort of 12% might imply. But the traffic on -- but then you asked why is the traffic on tripadvisor.com isn't growing as much. And the answer is, or partial answer is we have a fair amount of traffic over the past year that was coming from other English-speaking parts of the world: Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia, India, that had been ending up on tripadvisor.com, and so we would count it as domestic revenue because it's off of our dot com site. We've seen very strong growth in our non-dot com English language sites recently. And so part of that delta in international growth versus U.S. growth is actually, to some degree, it's English speakers who live outside the U.S. now going to their local point of sale. Now when we were buying our traffic through SEM, we would naturally buy it to the appropriate point of sale, so no change there. But Google's algorithm over the past year has changed and has favored local points of sale more. We have lots of local points of sale, so the Australian citizens are now hitting tripadvisor.com.au instead of tripadvisor.com. You see that in international revenue going up. We see it as revenue that was on dot com moving over to Australia. From a commerce perspective, it is neutral to us because when that Australian was visiting tripadvisor.com, they were seeing Australian commerce partners, the local OTAs in Australia anyways. So it's just the way were measuring it, it ended up on different points of sale. Finally, we do have a very active sales force in all parts the world that are constantly signing up more hotel chains and more of the local OTAs. It's just a fact that whenever we have more inventory in a given country, more properties that we can have our show prices button activated for and more choice initial prices because we don't just have 2 OTAs. We have 4. We don't have just one supplier and 1 OTA, we have a supplier and 3 OTAs, we make more money. That's the choice aspect that we strive for. And in Q1, just like in prior quarters, we added more choice on our newer points-of-sales. That improved the monetization rates. So we make a bit more money on international IPs. And I think that covered all 3 of the questions."

We do continue to lose money there. We continue to invest because we see the prize there being quite meaningful, and the model, we certainly believe will work in China. At this point, Kuxun is doing quite well on the flight side. Certainly, a strength in that part of the business as they've hooked up with a lot of individual agents, as well as several of the OTAs to really help the clients find the better price than what they can do on other sites. And on DaoDao, again, the focus remains on helping the user find the best hotel and overall the best travel experience. We're starting to leverage some of our additional worldwide sales activities because there's a lot of other western hotel companies looking to break into the China market, and we're a company that they're used to dealing with. And of course, the domestic traveler on the outbound trip, as everyone would tell you, is more valuable than the domestic traveler, even though much smaller number, but a more valuable commodity. And we have, far and away, the most reviews of anyone when you look at the entire set of places that the Chinese outbound traveler would go to. So we remain optimistic, but not a lot of detail I can report in terms of progress."

So I don't have off hand kind of the monthly image of the hotel shopper growth last year. I do recall our February call, where it was looking a lot darker at that time, when we were looking at our January hotel shopper growth. So January was a tougher start when we looked at the overall numbers as best we could tell. And then the quarter looked like -- the quarter did get better. We also did make some monetization improvements over the course of the quarter. So the hotel shoppers was a challenge, the monetization of the hotel shoppers, as we were still pulling out of the site redesign. And we're pleased to report that we were able to make some monetization progress, i.e. the 30% of the hotel shoppers that were visiting earlier in the quarter were converting less, and by the end of the quarter, they were stronger, so we were able to recover some of that loss. The CPC growth, I really wouldn't counsel, or I can say, we are not modeling a growth in CPC over the course of the rest of the year. And again, it's the bidding model, as I've said, but we'd be quite uncomfortable assuming a price increase as we look forward."

The RevPAR, when the hotelier or when the OTA is making more money because of a lead we send because RevPARs have gone up, they can literally afford to spend more of that. So if, for example, an OTA is willing to share 60% of the revenue that they make with us, just as an example, some pay more, some pay less, as that RevPAR goes up, we would see that increase. So if RevPAR is up 5%, it's fair to think of TripAdvisor deserving a 5% increase as our percentage. Do we always get that? No. That's a part of a negotiation with our sales rep and the client and it's part competition for that click, if in any particular country, hoteliers battling against an OTA for the lead, the hotelier has lots more margin they can offer and RevPAR going up, they can offer even more. They have a bigger piece of the pie than what the OTA has so they might be able to outbid. So again, relatively straightforward correlation with RevPAR, relatively straightforward correlation with booking rates in whatever particular country. If it's a highly engaged online country that has a high online conversion rate, that's great for us as well versus a country where there's a lot of lookers but most of the actual transaction happens offline, ergo we wouldn't get a lot of credit for those transactions, therefore client wouldn't be able to pay us a lot on a per-lead basis. To the other of your part of your question, the continued growth in our rest of world is really a function of a lot of our initiatives, and focus is around driving traffic throughout the globe, really not just in the U.S., but the fact that our U.S. and U.K. points of sale are really the most mature, they're the most well-known. So there's just a lot more room to attract new visitors in other markets. And I would expect that overall trend to certainly continue going forward."

I don't really recall how Expedia's CPCs may have changed Jan, Feb, March. The fact that I don't remember them being on a big upswing or downswing might lead you to fairly believe it wasn't something I was carefully watching for any particular reason. So they manage their bids carefully. Again, I can't say one thing for sure or not, but it wasn't something I was focused on, certainly. Overall, again, it's a bidding environment, so all the other partners are moving their things up and down. And we do see a fair amount of fluctuation kind of on a weekly basis, where some are moving up and some were moving down. Our averages tend not to change all that much. To the question on the Business Listings, so we do some simple math on the -- I think it's 570,000 accommodations on the site, and we have I think over 1/2 of them as registered owners now. And most of the registered owners are properties that have reviews. And so we qualify by properties that are popular enough to have a bunch of reviews. So the owner has probably heard of TripAdvisor because people have shown up, saying, ""Hey, I read about you on TripAdvisor."" So there's some knowledge built in. And then from memory, the different ways we tried to qualify out of that 570,000, it was well over 1/2 that we thought were perfectly reasonable folks who would be interested in the Business Listing subscription. It might have been something closer to 3/4 who have potential and then we take out the properties that really don't have a good reputation on the assumption that most of them probably wouldn't want to pay us for something. And we come up with again, well north of a couple hundred thousand viable prospects. When we then look and say, ""Well, viable prospect for what?"" Well, we say, ""There's a fixed annual subscription, the telephone number, the e-mail. Then there's the special offers. And then there's the placement on the mobile devices. And then there's incremental eyeballs that we might be able to offer down the road with additional marketing or advertising services."" And for these properties, it's pretty hard to be able to identify an audience looking to come in a particular time frame because we have date seek often for a particular city that are looking for a hotel. Wow, we've got that audience. We have the person doing a search for a specific date in a specific city where this hotel is located. So that's already a highly qualified customer and services down the road to help each of those individual hoteliers put their unique message in front of those folks. Right now, we have an annual subscription, but there's nothing inherent in our business model that says it couldn't be a CPA or a CPC or a CPM additional upsell in the years to come. And then we recognize that we have a ton of additional travelers, as I alluded to earlier, who, they've already picked out their hotel and now they're looking for something to do or they're looking for something to do first and then they'll find a place to stay or they're trying to figure out where they want to eat when they're on that trip. And all of those have the same dynamic of it's a traveler coming into the local market that the business owner really has a tough time reaching on a timely -- in a timely basis. And you can think of a restaurateur who may put a 2-for-1 coupon in the concierge desk of a hotel and say, ""Hey, I'm willing to offer a 2-for-1 special to out-of-town guests, who are asking the concierge at the hotel where to eat. That's a nice opportunity for the restaurant to get a customer that wasn't already a local, that wasn't already going to be eating there, i.e. the restaurant wasn't going to be giving the 2-for-1 away to an existing customer. Well that's the TripAdvisor eyeball as well. So I'm not preannouncing any product. I'm not talking about some functionality the next day, but we recognize that all of the business owners who are represented on TripAdvisor and some who aren't even represented on TripAdvisor now, but have a product or service to sell to the traveler, that TripAdvisor is a fantastic kind of media opportunity for them. And with the self-service capabilities we've built, the Business Listings, with the worldwide sales force, to reach the folks that aren't self-service inclined, we feel we're in a pretty good position to take advantage of those opportunities."

I will start by summarizing operating results for the first quarter, and then do a deeper dive on a few important developments since our last call. I'll then turn it over to Julie, who will provide a more detailed look at both our financial results and our outlook. 
We had a strong start to 2012. We generated record quarterly revenue of $184 million, further extended our market leadership position in content and traffic and continued our focus on providing the best user experience possible through partnerships and product innovation. Julie will provide more color on the Q1 results, but suffice it to say that our better-than-expected revenue and profit performance was driven primarily by stronger hotel shopper growth, which was up over 30% year-over-year, as well as slightly better CPC pricing. From this position of strength, we chose to reinvest some of the revenue upside to continue to pursue our long-term growth strategies. 
Driving traffic growth, both domestically and internationally, remains at the core of our strategic growth plan. With an average of over 50 million worldwide unique visitors in Q1, according to comScore data, TripAdvisor remains the largest travel site in the world. This comScore data reflects 39% year-over-year traffic growth to TripAdvisor sites. When we look at our internal logs, we see a similar growth rate, but off a consistently higher unique visitor count. More importantly, it is the hotel shopper traffic, our monthly unique visitors who view a specific hotel page or listings of a hotel in a city on any TripAdvisor point of sale, that interests us most, as it remains the key driver of our click-based revenue stream. 
We are a global brand, as evidenced by the fact that 1/3 of our hotel shoppers are visiting tripadvisor.com. The remaining 2/3 are on TripAdvisor's international websites. However, with the breadth -- even with our breadth and massive scale, TripAdvisor still represents less than 10% of worldwide travel unique visitors. We continue to see tremendous traffic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
I'd now like to address several other key areas for the company in the past quarter: partnerships, social and mobile. Our global partnership effort had a direct positive effect on our brand recognition, and ultimately, our traffic growth. Notably in March, we announced a content licensing partnership with Wyndham Hotel Group, who saw conversion rates increase by 30% when they integrated TripAdvisor reviews onto the wyndhamrewards.com site. In April, we announced the deepening of this partnership where TripAdvisor will power a guest satisfaction survey in support of Wyndham's WYN review program, an online management tool the hotel group launched earlier this year. Reviews submitted through the survey will be available on Wyndham brand websites, as well as on TripAdvisor. 
This Wyndham relationship is just one example of our more than 400 content licensing partnership deals with major travel and destination sites around the world. We also have more than 50,000 smaller websites showing TripAdvisor content, including self-service badges and widgets, which are great for brand recognition. 
Regarding social, TripAdvisor is a recognized pioneer in social travel planning through our wisdom of friends initiative. By the end of Q1, we had personalized the trip planning experience for nearly 120 million Facebook users, which is up 34% since the end of 2011. Our Cities I've Visited app continues to be one of the most-used Facebook apps in the travel category. Generally speaking, Facebook-connected users are more engaged on TripAdvisor sites as measured by page views per session and content contribution. Additionally, 1 out of every 4 reviews is written by a Facebook-connected user, so we are pleased with the engagement that we've seen to date. 
One of my favorite new social features on TripAdvisor is Friend of a Friend, which allows me to tap into my Facebook friends' networks for travel advice even if one of my friends hasn't left a review in a city. Through this feature, Facebook-enabled TripAdvisor users are seeing friend content 10x more than before. The users will continue to benefit from the wisdom of the crowds, but our Friend of a Friend rollout is an innovative and important next step towards integrating social into the fabric of travel research in creating a more robust user experience. 
In addition to social, we continue to develop and improve our mobile offerings. We launched our SeatGuru mobile app and also announced a new HTML5 cross-platform tablet app, now available on Android and iOS. At the Mobile World Congress event in late February, we announced that a recent Distimo study dubbed TripAdvisor the second most downloaded travel app in the App Store during 2011, behind Google Earth. This trend should continue into 2012. During the first quarter, we averaged over 25 downloads per minute, and by the end of March, reached 17 million cumulative mobile app downloads, up more than 300% year-over-year. According to our internal log, we averaged more than 21 million monthly unique visitors via mobile devices in Q1, which is up nearly 200% year-over-year. Also, more than 1 million TripAdvisor City Guides were downloaded in Q1, up more than 300% since the end of 2011. 
As we think about mobile, we bifurcate between smartphone and tablet, in part due to the relative demographics of users on these devices, but more so due to the richer experience on the larger screen and usage patterns for researching and booking travel. Over the past year, our smartphone app is our largest absolute grower, but our tablet app is the fastest percent grower in terms of page views, sessions and unique users. Engagement increased as well, as mobile page views were up more than 250% year-over-year, driven by our smartphone app, which accounted for more than 30% of total mobile page views. We have also seen the page views per tablet app session rise more than 40% during that time frame. 
Mobile is growing tremendously, to be sure, but we currently do not optimize for commerce, which is a conscious decision on our part, given that our strategic focus centers on increasing user engagement. As such, we see smartphone sessions currently monetizing at roughly 10% to 20% of desktop, while tablet sessions are monetizing at approximately 50% to 60% of desktop. This means that tablet users, both app and tablet websites, are currently driving nearly 2/3 of our mobile revenue. Mobile is a valuable extension of the TripAdvisor platform, and if we can continue to build new mobile functionality, grow our content and improve the user experience, we believe that additional revenue opportunities will follow. 
Beyond the success that we are seeing in our traffic, content, social and mobile initiatives, we have also had notable developments in our subscription-based and transaction products, business listings and vacation rentals as we continue to add to our sales and engineering teams. Specifically, our Business Listing team is executing on a very aggressive sales force hiring plan. At the simplest level, our Business Listing product allows businesses an easy, cost effective way to market to tourists. Our consistent, worldwide traffic growth fundamentally makes these marketing services more and more valuable each year. This team's objective is to capture this huge opportunity we have with our installed base of more than 570,000 accommodations, and down the road, the nearly 1 million restaurants and attractions that are listed on our site. We are pleased with the progress to date, and although we are slightly behind where we would like to be on hiring, we are excited not only by the strong prospects for this product in the second half of 2012, but also the longer-term opportunity that it represents. 
Finally, as you know, TripAdvisor, Inc. encompasses many companies in 19 different travel brands, all of which represent different stages of the trip planning value chain. In March, our SmarterTravel subsidiary launched Tingo, an innovative hotel booking product that is complementary in many respects to their other transaction-oriented site, SniqueAway. Tingo allows hotel shoppers to book hotels with confidence based on the fact that if the room rate drops prior to their stay, they will get the difference automatically refunded back to them. Initial feedback from customers has been quite positive, and the early read on the booking window indicates that we are hitting our target audience, as customers are booking an average of 40 days out, which is significantly longer than the industry average. 
In summary, we're very excited about the business and the progress we are making towards our vision of helping travelers plan and have the perfect trip. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the results and our financial outlook."
140233,183576299,294591,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on this past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems",1115,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on this past quarter, our first full quarter as a public company, we are very pleased with both our financial and operational results. Our employees have swiftly migrated off legacy Expedia systems and delivered financial results ahead of our expectations. For the first full quarter, revenue increased -- for the first quarter, revenue increased 23% to $184 million. Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by a fad click-based revenue. Click-based revenue was up 20% to $144.9 million, significantly ahead of our expectations, primarily due to growth in hotel shoppers, and to a much lesser extent, better pricing. 
Let me take a moment to tie some of these numbers together. Click-based revenue was up 20% year-over-year on slightly better pricing, while as Steve mentioned, hotel shopper growth was up more than 30% in the same period. Most of the delta in year-over-year growth rate is due to our site redesign completed last year, which reduced comments, or said another way, reduced the number of monetization opportunities on our hotel pages. 
Display-based advertising grew 17% in Q1 to $21.6 million, and in line with our 2012 expectations of mid to high teens. We saw CPM prices increase slightly as compared to Q1 of last year. As discussed, we've maintained a premium price in the CPM market and therefore, have more inventory than we need. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, Vacation Rentals and our Transactions businesses, had a strong Q1, growing 67% to $17.2 million. We set very aggressive targets for these business lines. For example, Business Listings originally planned to complete the sales force build out in early Q1. We are making good progress, but the sales force build-out is running slightly behind plan. This leads to some expense savings, but also makes achieving annual revenue targets for this product more challenging. However, we did see strong bookings per rep, and based on customer demand, we remain optimistic for a strong growth in 2012.
As it relates to geographic mix, our revenue continues to diversify internationally to better match our traffic. Non-U.S. revenue was 48% of total revenue this past quarter compared to 43% in the first quarter of 2011, as measured by the website on which the transactions occur. With international revenue growing roughly 3x faster than U.S. revenue, we continue to invest aggressively in our international markets, given the opportunity that we see in front of us in international expansion. 
As it relates to expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.3 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than our expected annual target range of high 30s to low 40s. This is primarily due to better-than-expected revenue performance and was partially offset by some investments we made to drive traffic diversification. 
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $16.3 million, 9% of revenue for the quarter and in line with our expectations. We would expect this expense line to stay at a relatively consistent percent of revenue for the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.2 million, 8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. We believe that we have completed most of our investment in public company infrastructure and expect to see leverage on this line item on an annual basis going forward. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.1 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $4.7 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. 
For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be consistent with 2011 and expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the quarter. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers of our effective tax rate are the mix of domestic versus foreign income, state taxes and nondeductible stock compensation expense. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. 
In terms of liquidity, we paid down the $10 million of outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility, leaving us with a full $200 million available and ended the quarter with $208.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash flow from operations was $29.7 million or 16% of revenue for the quarter. As I mentioned on our last call, Expedia receivables are now paid in the normal course of business versus being netted in intercompany accounts. This change resulted in a onetime reduction in cash flow equal to the quarterly change in Expedia's receivable balance. For full year 2012, we expect cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or below 30s as a percent of revenue. 
Q1 CapEx was 4% of revenue. Given our capital efficient business model, we continue to expect this line to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $22.4 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q1 with just over 1,300 employees, up from just over 1,250 at the end of 2011. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are focused on engineering, sales and marketing. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook. This past quarter's revenue results exceeded our expectations as hotel shopper growth trended higher throughout the quarter and pricing was a little better than expected as well. However, given that we generate over 1 billion annual clicks for our clients, our forecast is extremely sensitive to even slight changes in pricing and soon, year-over-year growth rates. So of course, we are wary of extrapolating forward metrics, like hotel shopper growth and partner CPC pricing that can exhibit such high variability. However, we do expect 2012 revenue growth to trend above the midpoint of our previously provided mid to high teens revenue-growth forecast, driven mainly by recent trends in our click-based business and partially offset by our subscription and other revenue, where we are working to catch up in our sales hiring plans. 
With regards to the latter group, we now forecast 2012 subscription and other revenues to be a high double-digit revenue grower this year. We continue to expect display-based advertising revenue consistent with 2011. We forecast 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars, based on the overachievement in Q1. Should the top line continue to beat our expectation, we will likely continue to reinvest most or all of the excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts, as we believe this is in the best, long-term interest of the business. 
In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2012. We will now open the call to your questions."

Are all the CPC initiatives and de-cluttering fully baked in that number? Or is it just a new kind of established run rate at kind of down 4% year-on-year? And then a question on the non-Expedia customers of yours. That spend was up about almost 40% year-on-year. Do you think that could see some acceleration as some of your non-Expedia advertisers get more aggressive throughout 2012 or versus the right run rate?"

The site redesign is all done, Expedia's had plenty of time to adjust their bids to the new world order, if you will. So Expedia lowered their pricing on the hotel clicks, but we're also sending them fewer of the photo or map clicks, which were much lower priced. So net-net, the Expedia rev was down a bit, but again, it's highly variable depending on the type of the clicks that we sent them with respect to the actual pricing. When we look at the non-Expedia revenue, obviously with Expedia staying where it is, the other clients are happily taking up the slack, the slack being additional volume. So as a bidding environment, when we move forward, the degree to which we can grow our hotel shopper traffic, we have a high degree of confidence that there are plenty of customers very interested in those leads in all of our points of sale. We like it when there's a bidding war that we can get going in certain markets or at certain regions, but we haven't baked in anything like that into our planning going forward."

So we're giving you the notion that, well yes, we have a lot of our traffic on the site is hotel shoppers, the growth rate on the other stuff is clearly higher because it's averaging out according to comScore at 39%. We've been clear. We don't make much money, and we certainly sell CPM ads against all of it and some sponsorships against all of it, but the click-based revenue comes primarily from the hotel shoppers. What I alluded to at the end of my prepared remarks was that the Business Listing organization, as it has been growing, we've clearly focused it on the opportunity for hoteliers because their return on the purchase of the Business Listing is so straightforward, it's so amazing and it's relatively easy for us to reach those 500,000 hoteliers, relatively easy, compared to the 1 million restaurants and attractions, some of whom are frankly, barely online. When we look out a couple of years, we see -- we project a continued growth in overall traffic, probably a higher growth in the restaurant attraction-type traffic, as we have more and more tourists on our site for all sorts of things. So where we have eyeballs, we feel optimistic that we would be able to monetize them for attractions and restaurants and tour guides and other things to do once in destination. I don't believe it will be as significant as what we can do for the hotelier, but we do think both on desktop and mobile, that those will become valuable eyeballs to us in the outlying -- in the future years, not so much 2012."

That always sorts of enhances usability and customer feedback. It's darn hard for me to tie that to the growth in hotel shoppers. We see growth across all of our significant channels, be it free search, paid search, e-mail, domain direct, pretty much anything that amounts to a meaningful channel that we source, is growing and is growing in just about every corner of the world, so international growing faster than our U.S. point of sale as we've otherwise shared with you. So again, across the board, probably mildly affected by -- I say probably, it's really just a guess on my part -- affected by the ongoing challenges in Southern Europe. But I can't really point to the de-cluttering being the reason why our traffic has grown. With regard to Google's activity, the second part of your question, we certainly see them in the search results with their hotel finder occupying the very top position for frequent -- for major city hotel searches. We can't, at the moment, see a meaningful loss of traffic to us because of that. Again, that's not to say it couldn't happen in the future, and it's possible that we just can't measure it well enough to note it yet, and of course, they're just starting to roll that out.

And so as you can imagine, a good part of that spend is directed towards international growth."

So in order, certainly we do see content growth related to overall traffic growth. The more visitors we have, this has always been true. The more visitors, the more review contributions we have and that's part of our challenge when we start in brand new markets, where we have not a lot of traffic, we don't get a lot of reviews and we need to jumpstart that process. We've since, especially over the past -- essentially over the past 12 months or so, done a fair amount of focus on helping to reward our members with badges and such to help get them more engaged in our community, to write more reviews and we certainly have seen that pay off with higher reviews per user contribution rate. So we've proven to ourselves, at least, that if we spend a little bit more time engaging with our members, we can get more content out of it. To your second question, the relative U.S. growth, so it is a little more complicated. But when we looked at this and asked the same question ourselves, it is a little more complicated than on the face value. One of the things that's going on is when we look at U.S. visitors, people -- sorry, I'll be even clearer. When we look at people who live in the U.S. and they're coming to tripadvisor.com usually, and the growth rate there is actually higher than that sort of 12% might imply. But the traffic on -- but then you asked why is the traffic on tripadvisor.com isn't growing as much. And the answer is, or partial answer is we have a fair amount of traffic over the past year that was coming from other English-speaking parts of the world: Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia, India, that had been ending up on tripadvisor.com, and so we would count it as domestic revenue because it's off of our dot com site. We've seen very strong growth in our non-dot com English language sites recently. And so part of that delta in international growth versus U.S. growth is actually, to some degree, it's English speakers who live outside the U.S. now going to their local point of sale. Now when we were buying our traffic through SEM, we would naturally buy it to the appropriate point of sale, so no change there. But Google's algorithm over the past year has changed and has favored local points of sale more. We have lots of local points of sale, so the Australian citizens are now hitting tripadvisor.com.au instead of tripadvisor.com. You see that in international revenue going up. We see it as revenue that was on dot com moving over to Australia. From a commerce perspective, it is neutral to us because when that Australian was visiting tripadvisor.com, they were seeing Australian commerce partners, the local OTAs in Australia anyways. So it's just the way were measuring it, it ended up on different points of sale. Finally, we do have a very active sales force in all parts the world that are constantly signing up more hotel chains and more of the local OTAs. It's just a fact that whenever we have more inventory in a given country, more properties that we can have our show prices button activated for and more choice initial prices because we don't just have 2 OTAs. We have 4. We don't have just one supplier and 1 OTA, we have a supplier and 3 OTAs, we make more money. That's the choice aspect that we strive for. And in Q1, just like in prior quarters, we added more choice on our newer points-of-sales. That improved the monetization rates. So we make a bit more money on international IPs. And I think that covered all 3 of the questions."

At this point, Kuxun is doing quite well on the flight side. Certainly, a strength in that part of the business as they've hooked up with a lot of individual agents, as well as several of the OTAs to really help the clients find the better price than what they can do on other sites. And on DaoDao, again, the focus remains on helping the user find the best hotel and overall the best travel experience. We're starting to leverage some of our additional worldwide sales activities because there's a lot of other western hotel companies looking to break into the China market, and we're a company that they're used to dealing with. And of course, the domestic traveler on the outbound trip, as everyone would tell you, is more valuable than the domestic traveler, even though much smaller number, but a more valuable commodity. And we have, far and away, the most reviews of anyone when you look at the entire set of places that the Chinese outbound traveler would go to. So we remain optimistic, but not a lot of detail I can report in terms of progress."

So I don't have off hand kind of the monthly image of the hotel shopper growth last year. I do recall our February call, where it was looking a lot darker at that time, when we were looking at our January hotel shopper growth. So January was a tougher start when we looked at the overall numbers as best we could tell. And then the quarter looked like -- the quarter did get better. We also did make some monetization improvements over the course of the quarter. So the hotel shoppers was a challenge, the monetization of the hotel shoppers, as we were still pulling out of the site redesign. And we're pleased to report that we were able to make some monetization progress, i.e. the 30% of the hotel shoppers that were visiting earlier in the quarter were converting less, and by the end of the quarter, they were stronger, so we were able to recover some of that loss. The CPC growth, I really wouldn't counsel, or I can say, we are not modeling a growth in CPC over the course of the rest of the year. And again, it's the bidding model, as I've said, but we'd be quite uncomfortable assuming a price increase as we look forward."

The RevPAR, when the hotelier or when the OTA is making more money because of a lead we send because RevPARs have gone up, they can literally afford to spend more of that. So if, for example, an OTA is willing to share 60% of the revenue that they make with us, just as an example, some pay more, some pay less, as that RevPAR goes up, we would see that increase. So if RevPAR is up 5%, it's fair to think of TripAdvisor deserving a 5% increase as our percentage. Do we always get that? No. That's a part of a negotiation with our sales rep and the client and it's part competition for that click, if in any particular country, hoteliers battling against an OTA for the lead, the hotelier has lots more margin they can offer and RevPAR going up, they can offer even more. They have a bigger piece of the pie than what the OTA has so they might be able to outbid. So again, relatively straightforward correlation with RevPAR, relatively straightforward correlation with booking rates in whatever particular country. If it's a highly engaged online country that has a high online conversion rate, that's great for us as well versus a country where there's a lot of lookers but most of the actual transaction happens offline, ergo we wouldn't get a lot of credit for those transactions, therefore client wouldn't be able to pay us a lot on a per-lead basis. To the other of your part of your question, the continued growth in our rest of world is really a function of a lot of our initiatives, and focus is around driving traffic throughout the globe, really not just in the U.S., but the fact that our U.S. and U.K. points of sale are really the most mature, they're the most well-known. So there's just a lot more room to attract new visitors in other markets. And I would expect that overall trend to certainly continue going forward."

I don't really recall how Expedia's CPCs may have changed Jan, Feb, March. The fact that I don't remember them being on a big upswing or downswing might lead you to fairly believe it wasn't something I was carefully watching for any particular reason. So they manage their bids carefully. Again, I can't say one thing for sure or not, but it wasn't something I was focused on, certainly. Overall, again, it's a bidding environment, so all the other partners are moving their things up and down. And we do see a fair amount of fluctuation kind of on a weekly basis, where some are moving up and some were moving down. Our averages tend not to change all that much. To the question on the Business Listings, so we do some simple math on the -- I think it's 570,000 accommodations on the site, and we have I think over 1/2 of them as registered owners now. And most of the registered owners are properties that have reviews. And so we qualify by properties that are popular enough to have a bunch of reviews. So the owner has probably heard of TripAdvisor because people have shown up, saying, ""Hey, I read about you on TripAdvisor."" So there's some knowledge built in. And then from memory, the different ways we tried to qualify out of that 570,000, it was well over 1/2 that we thought were perfectly reasonable folks who would be interested in the Business Listing subscription. It might have been something closer to 3/4 who have potential and then we take out the properties that really don't have a good reputation on the assumption that most of them probably wouldn't want to pay us for something. And we come up with again, well north of a couple hundred thousand viable prospects. When we then look and say, ""Well, viable prospect for what?"" Well, we say, ""There's a fixed annual subscription, the telephone number, the e-mail. Then there's the special offers. And then there's the placement on the mobile devices. And then there's incremental eyeballs that we might be able to offer down the road with additional marketing or advertising services."" And for these properties, it's pretty hard to be able to identify an audience looking to come in a particular time frame because we have date seek often for a particular city that are looking for a hotel. Wow, we've got that audience. We have the person doing a search for a specific date in a specific city where this hotel is located. So that's already a highly qualified customer and services down the road to help each of those individual hoteliers put their unique message in front of those folks. Right now, we have an annual subscription, but there's nothing inherent in our business model that says it couldn't be a CPA or a CPC or a CPM additional upsell in the years to come. And then we recognize that we have a ton of additional travelers, as I alluded to earlier, who, they've already picked out their hotel and now they're looking for something to do or they're looking for something to do first and then they'll find a place to stay or they're trying to figure out where they want to eat when they're on that trip. And all of those have the same dynamic of it's a traveler coming into the local market that the business owner really has a tough time reaching on a timely -- in a timely basis. And you can think of a restaurateur who may put a 2-for-1 coupon in the concierge desk of a hotel and say, ""Hey, I'm willing to offer a 2-for-1 special to out-of-town guests, who are asking the concierge at the hotel where to eat. That's a nice opportunity for the restaurant to get a customer that wasn't already a local, that wasn't already going to be eating there, i.e. the restaurant wasn't going to be giving the 2-for-1 away to an existing customer. Well that's the TripAdvisor eyeball as well. So I'm not preannouncing any product. I'm not talking about some functionality the next day, but we recognize that all of the business owners who are represented on TripAdvisor and some who aren't even represented on TripAdvisor now, but have a product or service to sell to the traveler, that TripAdvisor is a fantastic kind of media opportunity for them. And with the self-service capabilities we've built, the Business Listings, with the worldwide sales force, to reach the folks that aren't self-service inclined, we feel we're in a pretty good position to take advantage of those opportunities."

The second quarter completed a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We generated a record quarterly revenue of $197 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, continued to grow traffic in hotel shoppers while taking important steps to optimize traffic quality and continued growing and leveraging our social and mobile initiatives to drive user adoption. We're making tremendous headway on content collection, membership and traffic. At the end of Q2, we passed the 75 million reviews and opinions milestone and our travel community continues to add content at 50 contributions per minute, which translated to an accelerated pace of more than 25 million contributions for 2012. Marketable member growth, travelers whom we have permission to e-mail on a regular basis, also accelerated during the quarter, growing over 25% to more than 32 million, up over 60% year-over-year. 
The top of our funnel, total traffic growth also remained strong, as Q2 comScore data reflects an average of more than 54 million worldwide unique visitors to TripAdvisor sites, up more than 31% year-over-year. Further down the funnel, hotel shoppers, the key metric for our click-based revenue line, was up approximately 30% year-over-year and would've been higher were it not for a strategy change that I'll discuss in a minute. User engagement on the site was up us well, as we saw growth in time spent per session and page views per session, according to our internal log files. We attribute this growth in user engagement to our robust email campaigns and continued efforts to personalize the site experience. 
In Social, we are finding great ways to leverage the building blocks we put in place on the Facebook platform. In April, we merged our TripAdvisor and Cities I've Visited apps into one app, better integrating Facebook's users' activity within TripAdvisor and allowing friends to find TripAdvisor more easily on Facebook. In the first half of the year, TripAdvisor published more than 300 million actions generated from member activity on our website or using our App into Facebook's open graph. In June alone, we had over 32 million logged-in Facebook users use the TripAdvisor app or be instantly personalized on the site. This traffic level makes TripAdvisor the second most popular Facebook app, according to AppData. These efforts have been very successful in terms of brand awareness, content and community building, and growing our friend-connected member base. 
In addition to Social, our mobile initiatives continue to thrive as we continued to invest in and innovate on this fast-growing platform. During the quarter, we rolled out our new iPad app and introduced Facebook log-in optionality. We also launched 30 new free City Guides across IOS and Android, bringing our coverage to 50 cities. As of June 30, we reached over 22 million cumulative mobile app downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides and SeatGuru apps on smartphones and tablets, up more than 200% year-over-year. We also grew to more than 27 million monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor on mobile devices in May. Further, tablet continues to be our fastest grower in terms of mobile page views, sessions and unique users and accounts for more than 3/4 of our mobile revenue. We're obviously pleased with our mobile growth and we are focused on creating even more complete user experience on mobile, which will lead to an  even more loyal and engaged user community. 
One of the more interesting developments this quarter was our traffic quality improvement initiative, which spanned the quarter and affected all geographies. We leveraged our massive amount of user, click and traffic conversion data to identify traffic that converted well on TripAdvisor but didn't convert as well on partner sites. In other words, these are visitors who browsed a TripAdvisor site, click on a paid link to visit one of our clients but ultimately didn't make a booking. While we get paid for that click, we know we aren't ultimately helping our clients make money. Using this information, we reduced our SEM spend on lower-performing traffic as we believe this will increase the conversion rate for our clients. Rather than reinvest this cost savings in search marketing, we chose to reallocate some of it towards our traffic diversification efforts, including our marketing campaigns on Facebook. This initiative lowered our hotel shopper growth, which translated into lower top line revenue growth, but also drove our improved Q2 EBITDA performance. Absent this strategy change, we would have seen higher Q2 hotel shopper growth, perhaps even accelerated growth from Q1, and revenue could have been approximately $5 million to $10 million higher. 
This traffic quality improvement strategy is another example of us doing what's right for the business longer term even at the expense of near-term growth. Whereas our site redesign last year helped improve user experience for our community, this initiative targets improved downstream conversion for our clients. We view this as a new steady state for our business as we strive to optimize and diversify our traffic sources while we can easily increase SEM spend if the opportunity arises. Despite this optimization, it's important to note that we continue to expect revenue growth in the high teens for 2012. However, our strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin performance should not be taken as a new run rate. We have captured just a fraction of the Global Travel market online and we remain firmly within an investment cycle focused on capturing worldwide market share. 
Another key investment areas we're pleased with the progress that we made during the first half of the year, our rest of the world growth remains strong and notably, our APAC sales team was pleased to add SeeTrip to our growing list of partners in that region. In our Subscription businesses, our Business Listing team has progressed nicely on their sales force hiring plan and rolled out a new mobile upgrade product as a value add for hoteliers and [indiscernible]. Finally, we're also executing nicely in our vacation rental business on TripAdvisor and on Holiday Lettings and FlipKey. 
In summary, we're tracking very well to our 2012 goals. I'll now turn the call over to Julie who will provide some color on the Q2 results and our financial outlook."
140233,213580625,329711,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. T",1358,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. The 7-percentage-point sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth rate can be explained by 3 main factors: We benefited from increased conversion, more than offset by year-over-year decline in pricing and the traffic quality improvement strategy; we saw increased hotel shopper conversion in Q2 relative to Q1, albeit on a slightly lower hotel shopper growth rate. Even with the unfavorable trends in foreign exchange rates, overall CPCs were stable in Q2 as compared to Q1. 
We did see CPCs increase in the U.S. but this was offset by CPC decreases internationally. However, when looking at the year-over-year growth rates sequentially, we had a tough pricing comp this past quarter compared to an easy pricing comp in the first quarter of this year. This accounted for 4 percentage points of the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. 
Finally, as Steve just described, we estimate that our traffic quality improvement strategy accounted for an additional 4 to 7 percentage points on the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. Lots of moving parts but the core fundamentals remain strong. 
Display-based advertising revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q2 to $26.6 million. The sequential deceleration was due in part to specific timing of ad purchases, including a unique customer buy during Q2 2011. Overall, our CPM prices increased slightly as compared to Q2 of last year. We continued to maintain a premium price in the CPM market and stable clickthrough rates, given our rich travel specific contents. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q2, growing 59% to $19.4 million, just slightly behind our expectations. In Business Listings, we continued to see a huge opportunity to diversify our customer base and develop the channel to distribute value-added products over the long term. Our near-term challenge is ramping sales execution on a global basis, such as connecting with a B&B in Vermont, while also building our relationship with a large independent hotel in Cancun, and concurrently determining the top domestic properties in Thailand. 
To that end, we are catching up to our aggressive sales force hiring plan and have seen encouraging productivity metrics. We remain focused on capturing the huge opportunity we have from Business Listings, as well as going our vacation rentals product in 2012 and beyond. 
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movements, non-U.S. revenue is 49% of total revenue during the second quarter compared to 48% in Q1 and 44% in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $63.3 million or 32% of revenue for the quarter, which is down sequentially in both absolute value and as a percentage of revenue. This was primarily due to lower SEM spend related to our strategy to increase traffic quality to our customers. We remain committed to making investments in our strategic growth opportunities and traffic diversification efforts. 
Given our year-to-date results however, we expect non-GAAP sales and marketing spend to remain under 40% as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Non-GAAP packing content expenses were $19.1 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, which is up 17% sequentially, driven by additional headcount cost and in line with our expectations. We expect this expense line to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.8 million or 8% of revenue, in line with our expectations. Investment in our public company infrastructure is essentially complete, and we expect quarterly G&A expenses to be relatively stable on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.5 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $6.8 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 31.5% for the quarter. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with $478.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. In early May, the warrants we inherited from the spinoff were exercised for approximately $213 million. The warrant exercises were the primary driver of the uptick in our basic and fully diluted weighted average share counts for the period. 
Cash flow from operations was $61.8 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or low 30s as a percent of revenue. Q2 CapEx was 3% of revenue. Given our capital-efficient business model, we continue to expect this line item to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $55.8 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q2 with just over 1,400 employees, up from just over 1,300 employees at the end of Q1. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are global in scale and are focused on engineering and sales. Also I'd like to provide a brief comment on foreign exchange impacts given the prevailing macroeconomic challenges overseas. As we've mentioned in the past, we forecast FX neutral based on current rates and do not try to anticipate movements in foreign exchange rates. Just over 20% of our revenue was denominated in euros and less than 10% in the British pound. A significant move in FX would have the greatest impact on revenue as we have natural hedges to help mitigate bottom line exposure. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. On the click-based revenue line, we are factoring in the Olympics and the continuation of our traffic quality improvement strategy as headwinds in Q3. We are also planning to roll out enhanced analytics for some of our large OTA partners on a test basis. Many of these customers have asked for more transparency in order to better understand the build landscape and in turn, increase their spend. We recognize the uncertainty this may present to our revenue results. While more transparency allows them to bid higher on their more profitable properties, it does come with a risk that clients will choose to optimize their spend without increasing revenue to TripAdvisor. 
In addition, we saw strong pricing in the second half of 2011 prior to the rollout of lower Expedia pricing at the end of the year. However, we expect continued strength in hotel shoppers and lapping of last year's site redesign to more than offset the potential headwinds I just described. Given all these dynamics, we currently expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year. 
Display-based revenue faces a tough comp in Q4 based on an unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. Given this and our year-to-date performance, we now expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display. We expect that full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth will be consistent with our year-to-date results. Importantly, early indicators for all these revenue lines are healthy as we continue to leverage our leadership position in the market. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars based on the better-than-expected results during the first half of the year. Given the strength in our core CPC business and reduced spend on SEM, we seek to reinvest all excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts. We are committed to driving long-term user growth and engagement in the business. 
In closing, the second quarter closed out a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We'll now open the call up to your questions."

And I'd also add, it was a meaningful shift in the way we're conducting our SEM business and SEM is a meaningful source of traffic for us. So as the teams have now built in the new formulas, if you will, into their model, now we get to move forward and optimize on those. So you could well see, we would hope to see us just getting better at finding the right traffic that once to not only convert on trip but convert all the way Downstream.

So we're going from every couple of weeks, you can update a set of properties and looking to test out. And we really have to learn how to do this effectively, test out over time a model where we're providing our clients a lot more information. And I can absolutely appreciate how, from the client perspective, we're an extremely valuable channel to them and they would like to know how they can effectively spend more by buying the type of traffic that they want in that our current system is just too primitive, frankly, for them to be able to do so. We're approaching it gingerly in the sense that we don't have as many potential clients as someone like Google has, that could bid for words. It's harder still in our system. And the dynamic is on TripAdvisor, you're essentially mostly bidding for a dated search. It's not keyword match and it involves a specific availability question that our users are asking and show prices box. Well, everyone of course compares us to the Google auction that they have. Ours is in one way more complicated because we have to have the date information and in one way simpler, we don't have to deal with broad matching or exact phrase or anything like that because the bidding at the property level, not the keyword level.

For us, Facebook is -- it's an excellent branding effort. It brings in lots of members. It is extremely global for us. So that's really not at all a U.S. type initiative in search overseas. We think of Facebook as very global. We think of search in terms of brand-new markets or relatively low-penetration for TripAdvisor versus mature markets. So we'll tend to lump Europe, U.K., U.S., Canada and several others as more mature markets and the Thailand and the Poland and the Brazil as newer markets. So we tend to treat the ROI we expect on search at a different level, depending on if it's mature or new. For Facebook similarly, the advertising on Facebook, the pricing varies depending on the type of market that we're advertising in. But in general, we go very global on that platform. To the second question on reaction from the travel agencies to Business Listings, no, we're not detecting frankly any feedback worth mentioning from the OTAs on having Business Listings on the site, website link and e-mail, a phone number. That's something that I think they're very used to doing in their channels. They're always offering their benefits over to supplier direct. I presume all of the OTAs would not be very happy if TripAdvisor.star turned into a booking engine where we started actually taking the booking for hotel room and that's really not the media model that we're looking after. So we view VL as fantastic additional channel, marketing services or independent or chain hoteliers around the globe and restaurants and attractions and other owners with whom literally we're just offering marketing services.

Thank God, they're wonderful, we got a ton of free traffic, we have a bunch of paid traffic, but we like to have other sources and it was viewed as -- we view it as into our long-term success to generate our own direct -- higher rate of domain traffic and other sources by which people are learning about TripAdvisor. From the SEM decision to kind of cut back, you can look at the revenue -- you can look at the extra dollars, the millions of dollars that we delivered on the bottom line that was above our own expectations and make the simple case that says, hey we should've just spent it at even 50% ROI, spending $1 to make $0.50 and we could have bumped the top line up by millions of dollars. That's a perfectly reasonable strategy. It's not the one we took because in that case, I'm actually spending a chunk of money and losing it on search. And we decided that we would rather, in our mature markets, spend those dollars, some of those dollars on the more branding and membership acquisition channels and Facebook is one that we're calling out because we're finding it's working for us. So the working is a little more harder to quantify. It's not a direct ROI spend but we're getting the content. We're getting the Facebook-connected members, which is really driving in our wisdom of friends strategy to build the value proposition beyond just a quick, hey let me check for you the hotel review and move on. So I can appreciate how some of these may be a bit of a surprise but I hope everyone can appreciate the balance of we have a lot of profit to spend, we could have chosen to invest it, in my view, unwisely in search, which would've generated more hotel shoppers and would've generated more top line revenue but less of the type of revenue that we're looking for, less of a longer term we have viewed as a valuable customer going forward. So proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years as the membership base grows and we continue to knock it out of the park in the content and collection space.

I'm not sharing any surprises. We absolutely see what we believe to be the macroeconomic conditions in Europe being a drag on our revenue growth and our overall conversion growth. Hotel shoppers, interestingly enough, are doing okay in U.K. and Europe, not as strong as the U.S., but still frankly, pretty strong, but the conversion of those shoppers to folks that are clicking to our clients is weaker than the U.S. And then on our client side, we're still seeing a pretty big hit there in terms of ad traffic actually booking and presumably if they're booking, maybe it's for cheaper property. So we see it as CPCs that come back to TripAdvisor and U.K. and EU is distinctly hurting compared to prior year. We frankly, we have no reason not to believe it's macroeconomic in nature as people are taking less expensive vacations and shopping around more as  opposed to buying more."

Depending on the type of keyword, they have a nice long session and read tons of reviews. Other times, they just do a quick price compare and depart. When they leave the long reviews, we love it. We feel like we have a great brand impression and we presume that customer comes back more frequently than the one that just did a quick price compare and out the door. In most cases, we don't have a member at that point. We had a visit. And that's great from trial but less good from a long-term perspective. What we're doing on Facebook, it's almost the reverse. It really is not generating immediate revenue at all for us. It's not generating a lot of traffic to the site immediately, at least from the Facebook side of things. But it is generating a member that is interacting with our site or our app, our Cities I Visited App who's generating content for us. We have an e-mail and we know who their friends are. So we're sharing the ratings, the reviews, the tips, the whatever across a broader set of people. So again, it's building up that Facebook-connected members that now hear from us every week, in whatever language they speak almost, and we're able to tell them what their friends are doing.

We continue to stay focused first on engagement but we see the end market opportunity as being potentially meaningful down the road as we get to offer better marketing services to the restaurants and attractions that are in market versus the hotel purchase, which is the absolute lion's share of our revenue stream now. There's some internal debate as to how much online booking TripAdvisor is going to be a part of in the very front end hotel research experience, just because on the phone, the screen is so darn small or people are going to want to review the information that TripAdvisor has versus their tablet. And so to the tablet point, hey do we think tablet will mimic desktop and most of the strategies we have on desktop will be just as applicable on tablet and tablet can even become better as the user demographics of folks using tablets probably spend more than on desktop, in general. So short answer is at the moment, it's more engagement and functionality but we do believe that mobile will become, a phone will become a much more interesting revenue stream for us in the outgoing years."

So the CPC outlook, I would say we did have some tougher comps, though when you look Q1 to Q2, it was basically flat, if I'm not mistaken, even though we had the CPC declines in Europe offset by CPC growth, pricing increase in the U.S. So you look at that and say we think what we're doing, were it not for the macroeconomic climate in Europe, would be sending CPC prices higher across the board. And again, they're strong in many regions. We think that that does have to do with our site redesign changes from last year, the quality improvements that we made on our SEM traffic this past quarter certainly contributing and just some other pieces of the site personalization efforts that we feel are driving higher qualified traffic to our clients. So going forward, I'm not going to be able to offer any prediction on the travel climate in Europe. Generally, when we forecast, we take the position of our rank next quarter is going to have the same mood, the same FX, the same everything as what we have today. So if you guys are betting things are going to get better, then that will help us. If it's going to get worse, it will hurt us. We believe ourselves to be reasonably sensitive to the overall economic climate. To your second question, algorithm and search results, we haven't seen much change by way of what Google's done in the past quarter. We don't think anything has affected us in a meaningful way. Certainly, we're pleased that we continue to have growth in our SEO channel, across I've got to believe all major markets. But we would absolutely expect that as the cycle of content creation has grown in all languages. So again, we get more content, more freshness, better results from user. Google favors sites that offer better results. We're one of those, so we tend to rise in the rankings. I haven't seen, to give a follow-up to your question, haven't seen Google places or local, whatever they're calling it now come out with any particularly interesting new features that we think are pulling traffic away from TripAdvisor. So again, stable. The integration they have with Zagat does appear more in the search results. Again, more on restaurants than hotel, so less meaningful to our business."

So our Q2 efforts, and I'm sure this is way more detailed than you were looking for, but the Q2 effort was really hey, let's not buy as much of that traffic because it's not really meeting our objective of being for that mature market being profitable on every click that we're buying. So we let go with some of that traffic and are choosing to reinvest it elsewhere."

The second quarter completed a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We generated record quarterly revenue of $197 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, continued to grow traffic and hotel shoppers while taking important steps to optimize traffic quality and continued growing and leveraging our social and mobile initiatives to drive user adoption. We're making tremendous headway on content collection, membership and traffic. At the end of Q2, we passed the 75 million reviews and opinions milestone and our travel community continues to add content at 50 contributions per minute, which translated to an accelerated pace of more than 25 million contributions for 2012. Marketable member growth, travelers whom we have permission to e-mail on a regular basis, also accelerated during the quarter, growing over 25% to more than 32 million, up over 60% year-over-year. 
The top of our funnel, total traffic growth, also remained strong, as Q2 comScore data reflects an average of more than 54 million worldwide unique visitors to TripAdvisor sites, up more than 31% year-over-year. Further down the funnel, hotel shoppers, the key metric for our click-based revenue line, was up approximately 30% year-over-year and would've been higher were it not for a strategy change that I'll discuss in a minute. User engagement on the site was up as well, as we saw growth in time spent per session and page views per session, according to our internal log files. We attribute this growth in user engagement to our robust email campaigns and continued efforts to personalize the site experience. 
In Social, we are finding great ways to leverage the building blocks we put in place on the Facebook platform. In April, we merged our TripAdvisor and Cities I've Visited apps into one app, better integrating Facebook's users' activity within TripAdvisor and allowing friends to find TripAdvisor more easily on Facebook. In the first half of the year, TripAdvisor published more than 300 million actions generated from member activity on our website or using our App into Facebook's Open Graph. In June alone, we had over 32 million logged-in Facebook users use the TripAdvisor app or be instantly personalized on the site. This traffic level makes TripAdvisor the second most popular Facebook app, according to AppData. These efforts have been very successful in terms of brand awareness, content and community building, and growing our friend-connected member base. 
In addition to Social, our mobile initiatives continue to thrive as we continue to invest in and innovate on this fast-growing platform. During the quarter, we rolled out our new iPad app and introduced Facebook log-in functionality. We also launched 30 new free City Guides across iOS and Android, bringing our coverage to 50 cities. As of June 30, we reached over 22 million cumulative mobile app downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides and SeatGuru apps on smartphones and tablets, up more than 200% year-over-year. We also grew to more than 27 million monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor on mobile devices in May. Further, tablet continues to be our fastest grower in terms of mobile page views, sessions and unique users and accounts for more than 3/4 of our mobile revenue. We're obviously pleased with our mobile growth and we are focused on creating a more complete user experience on mobile, which will lead to an  even more loyal and engaged user community. 
One of the more interesting developments this quarter was our traffic quality improvement initiative, which spanned the quarter and affected all geographies. We leveraged our massive amount of user, click and traffic conversion data to identify traffic that converted well on TripAdvisor but didn't convert as well on partner sites. In other words, these are visitors who browsed a TripAdvisor site, clicked on a paid link to visit one of our clients, but ultimately didn't make a booking. While we get paid for that click, we know we aren't ultimately helping our clients make money. Using this information, we reduced our SEM spend on lower-performing traffic as we believe this will increase the conversion rate for our clients. Rather than reinvest this cost savings in search marketing, we chose to reallocate some of it towards our traffic diversification efforts, including our marketing campaigns on Facebook. This initiative lowered our hotel shopper growth, which translated into lower top line revenue growth, but also drove our improved Q2 EBITDA performance. Absent this strategy change, we would have seen higher Q2 hotel shopper growth, perhaps even accelerated growth from Q1, and revenue could have been approximately $5 million to $10 million higher. 
This traffic quality improvement strategy is another example of us doing what's right for the business, longer term, even at the expense of near-term growth. Whereas our site redesign last year helped -- improved user experience for our community, this initiative targets improved downstream conversion for our clients. We view this as a new steady state for our business as we strive to optimize and diversify our traffic sources but we can easily increase SEM spend if the opportunity arises. Despite this optimization, it's important to note that we continue to expect revenue growth in the high teens for 2012. However, our strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin performance should not be taken as a new run rate. We have captured just a fraction of the Global Travel market online and we remain firmly within an investment cycle focused on capturing worldwide market share. 
In other key investment areas we're pleased with the progress that we made during the first half of the year, our rest of the world growth remains strong and, notably, our APAC sales team was pleased to add Ctrip to our growing list of partners in that region. In our Subscription businesses, our Business Listing team has progressed nicely on their sales force hiring plan and rolled out a new mobile upgrade product as a value add for hoteliers and [indiscernible]. Finally, we're also executing nicely in our vacation rental business on TripAdvisor and on Holiday Lettings and FlipKey. 
In summary, we're tracking very well to our 2012 goals. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q2 results and our financial outlook."
140233,213580625,329797,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. T",1359,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. The 7-percentage-point sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth rate can be explained by 3 main factors: We benefited from increased conversion, more than offset by year-over-year decline in pricing and the traffic quality improvement strategy; we saw increased hotel shopper conversion in Q2 relative to Q1, albeit on a slightly lower hotel shopper growth rate. Even with the unfavorable trend in foreign exchange rates, overall CPCs were stable in Q2 as compared to Q1. 
We did see CPCs increase in the U.S. but this was offset by CPC decreases internationally. However, when looking at the year-over-year growth rates, sequentially, we had a tough pricing comp this past quarter compared to an easy pricing comp in the first quarter of this year. This accounted for 4 percentage points of the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. 
Finally, as Steve just described, we estimate that our traffic quality improvement strategy accounted for an additional 4 to 7 percentage points on the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. Lots of moving parts but the core fundamentals remained strong. 
Display-based advertising revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q2 to $26.6 million. The sequential deceleration was due in part to specific timing of ad purchases, including a unique customer buy during Q2 2011. Overall, our CPM prices increased slightly as compared to Q2 of last year. We continued to maintain a premium price in the CPM market and stable clickthrough rates, given our rich travel specific contents. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q2, growing 59% to $19.4 million, just slightly behind our expectations. In Business Listings, we continue to see a huge opportunity to diversify our customer base and develop a channel to distribute value-added products over the long term. Our near-term challenge is ramping sales execution on a global basis, such as connecting with a B&B in Vermont, while also building our relationship with a large independent hotel in Cancun, and concurrently determining the top domestic properties in Thailand. 
To that end, we are catching up to our aggressive sales force hiring plan and have seen encouraging productivity metrics. We remain focused on capturing the huge opportunity we have from Business Listings, as well as growing our vacation rentals product in 2012 and beyond. 
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 49% of total revenue during the second quarter compared to 48% in Q1 and 44% in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $63.3 million or 32% of revenue for the quarter, which is down sequentially in both absolute value and as a percentage of revenue. This was primarily due to lower SEM spend related to our strategy to increase traffic quality to our customers. We remain committed to making investments in our strategic growth opportunities and traffic diversification efforts. 
Given our year-to-date results, however, we expect non-GAAP sales and marketing spend to remain under 40% as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $19.1 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, which is up 17% sequentially, driven by additional headcount cost and in line with our expectations. We expect this expense line to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.8 million or 8% of revenue, in line with our expectations. Investment in our public company infrastructure is essentially complete, and we expect quarterly G&A expenses to be relatively stable on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.5 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $6.8 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 31.5% for the quarter. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with $478.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. In early May, the warrants we inherited from the spinoff were exercised for approximately $213 million. The warrant exercises were the primary driver of the uptick in our basic and fully diluted weighted average share counts for the period. 
Cash flow from operations was $61.8 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or low 30s as a percent of revenue. Q2 CapEx was 3% of revenue. Given our capital-efficient business model, we continue to expect this line item to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $55.8 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q2 with just over 1,400 employees, up from just over 1,300 employees at the end of Q1. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are global in scale and are focused on engineering and sales. Also, I'd like to provide a brief comment on foreign exchange impacts given the prevailing macroeconomic challenges overseas. As we've mentioned in the past, we forecast FX neutral based on current rates and do not try to anticipate movements in foreign exchange rates. Just over 20% of our revenue was denominated in euros and less than 10% in the British pound. A significant move in FX would have the greatest impact on revenue as we have natural hedges to help mitigate bottom line exposure. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. On the click-based revenue line, we are factoring in the Olympics and the continuation of our traffic quality improvement strategy as headwinds in Q3. We are also planning to roll out enhanced analytics for some of our large OTA partners on a test basis. Many of these customers have asked for more transparency in order to better understand the big landscape and in turn, increase their spend. We recognize the uncertainty this may present to our revenue results. While more transparency allows them to bid higher on their more profitable properties, it does come with a risk that clients will choose to optimize their spend without increasing revenue to TripAdvisor. 
In addition, we saw strong pricing in the second half of 2011 prior to the rollout of lower Expedia pricing at the end of the year. However, we expect continued strength in hotel shoppers and lapping of last year's site redesign to more than offset the potential headwinds I just described. Given all these dynamics, we currently expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year. 
Display-based revenue faces a tough comp in Q4 based on an unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. Given this and our year-to-date performance, we now expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display. We expect that full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth will be consistent with our year-to-date results. Importantly, early indicators for all these revenue lines are healthy as we continue to leverage our leadership position in the market. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars based on the better-than-expected results during the first half of the year. Given the strength in our core CPC business and reduced spend on SEM, we seek to reinvest all excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts. We are committed to driving long-term user growth and engagement in the business. 
In closing, the second quarter closed out a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor.

We're not sure yet if we'll evolve all the way to a realtime.

So we're going from a every couple of weeks, you can update a set of properties and looking to test out. And we really have to learn how to do this effectively, test out over time a model where we're providing our clients a lot more information. And I can absolutely appreciate how, from the client perspective, we're an extremely valuable channel to them and they would like to know how they can effectively spend more by buying the type of traffic that they want and that our current system is just too primitive, frankly, for them to be able to do so. We're approaching it gingerly in the sense that we don't have as many potential clients as someone like Google has, that could bid for words. It's harder still on our system. And the dynamic is on TripAdvisor, you're essentially mostly bidding for a dated search. It's not keyword match and it involves a specific availability question that our users are asking and Show Prices box. Well, everyone of course compares us to the Google auction that they have. Ours is in one way more complicated because we have to have the date information and in one way simpler, we don't have to deal with broad matching or exact phrase or anything like that, because we're bidding at the property level, not the keyword level.

For us, Facebook is -- it's an excellent branding effort. It brings in lots of members. It is extremely global for us. So that's really not at all a U.S. type initiative in search overseas. We think of Facebook as very global. We think of search in terms of brand-new markets or relatively low-penetration for TripAdvisor versus mature markets. So we'll tend to lump Europe, U.K., U.S., Canada and several others as more mature markets and the Thailand and the Poland and the Brazil as newer markets. So we tend to treat the ROI we expect on search at a different level, depending on if it's mature or new. For Facebook similarly, the advertising on Facebook, the pricing varies depending on the type of market that we're advertising in. But in general, we go very global on that platform. To the second question on reaction from the travel agencies to Business Listings, no, we're not detecting frankly any feedback worth mentioning from the OTAs on having Business Listings on the site, website link and e-mail, a phone number. That's something that I think they're very used to doing in their channels. They're always offering their benefits over to supplier direct. I presume all of the OTAs would not be very happy if TripAdvisor.star turned into a booking engine where we started actually taking the booking for hotel room and that's really not the media model that we're looking after. So we view VL as fantastic additional channel, marketing services or independent or chain hoteliers around the globe and restaurants and attractions and other owners for whom we, literally, we're just offering marketing services. So that was a long answer to the simple question saying no, no negative reactions to OTAs for VL."

So we've been talking for a while about diversifying our traffic sources. So search engines, as you know, are a significant source. Thank God, they're wonderful, we get a ton of free traffic, we buy a bunch of paid traffic, but we like to have other sources and it was viewed as -- we view it as into our long-term success to generate our own domain direct -- higher rate of domain direct traffic and other sources by which people are learning about TripAdvisor. From the SEM decision to kind of cut back, you can look at the revenue -- you can look at the extra dollars, the millions of dollars that we've delivered on the bottom line that was above our own expectations and make the simple case that says, hey, we just should've spent it at even 50% ROI, spending $1 to make $0.50 and we could have bumped the top line up by millions of dollars. And that's a perfectly reasonable strategy. It's not the one we took because, in that case, I'm actually spending a chunk of money and losing it on search. And we've decided that we would rather, in our mature markets, spend those dollars, some of those dollars, on the more branding and membership acquisition channels and Facebook is one that we're calling out because we're finding it's working for us. So the working is a little more harder to quantify. It's not a direct ROI spend but we're getting the content. We're getting the Facebook-connected members, which is really driving in our wisdom of friends strategy to build the value proposition beyond just a quick, hey, let me check for you the hotel review and move on. So I can appreciate how some of these may be a bit of a surprise but I hope everyone can appreciate the balance of we have a lot of profit to spend, we could have chosen to invest it, in my view, unwisely in search, which would've generated more hotel shoppers and would've generated more top line revenue but less of the type of revenue that we're looking for, less of the longer term we have viewed as a valuable customer going forward. So proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years as the membership base grows and we continue to knock it out of the park in the content and collection space. But you can see in the quarter where we've spent and I guess the final part of my long-winded answer would be we would have spent more in the second quarter had we had enough of the campaigns set up on channels like Facebook because we're pleased that we have found some things that, to our metrics, are working for us."

So with the second one first, yes, we're putting a couple of additional, I'm not sure yet how many engineers against that particular project. But we're talking a small handful. So it's nothing that would be noticeable in any of our lines in terms of building out that bidding system. Again, most of our clients primarily just want the information in order to be able to bid in a smarter way. So it's a small resource allocation from my perspective. To your mobile question, we absolutely do look at mobile as a revenue stream down the road. We continue to stay focused first on engagement but we see the in-market opportunity as being potentially meaningful down the road as we get to offer better marketing services to the restaurants and attractions that are in market versus the hotel purchase, which is the absolute lion's share of our revenue stream now. There's some internal debate as to how much online booking TripAdvisor is going to be a part of in the very front end hotel research experience, just because on the phone, the screen is so darn small or people are going to want to review the information that TripAdvisor has versus their tablet. And so to the tablet point, hey, we think tablet will mimic desktop and most of the strategies we have on desktop will be just as applicable on tablet and tablet could even become better as the user demographics of folks using tablets probably spend more than on desktop, in general. So short answer is at the moment, it's more engagement and functionality but we do believe that mobile will become, a phone will become a much more interesting revenue stream for us in the outgoing years."

Two good questions. So the CPC outlook, I would, say we did have some tougher comps, though when you look Q1 to Q2, it was basically flat, if I'm not mistaken, even though we had the CPC declines in Europe offset by CPC growth, pricing increase in the U.S. So you look at them and say, we think what we're doing, were it not for the macroeconomic climate in Europe, would be sending CPC prices higher across the board. And again, they're strong in many regions. We think that, that does have to do with our site redesign changes from last year, the quality improvements that we made on our SEM traffic this past quarter certainly contributing and just some other pieces of the site personalization efforts that we feel are driving higher qualified traffic to our clients. So going forward, I'm not going to be able to offer any prediction on the travel climate in Europe. Generally, when we forecast, we take the position of, all right, next quarter is going to have the same mood, the same FX, the same everything as what we have today. So if you guys are betting things are going to get better, then that will help us. If it's going to get worse, that will hurt us, where we believe ourselves to be reasonably sensitive to the overall economic climate. To your second question, algorithmic search results, we haven't seen much change by way of what Google's done in the past quarter. We don't think anything has affected us in a meaningful way. Certainly, we're pleased that we continue to have growth in our SEO channel, across, I've got to believe, all major markets. But we would absolutely expect that as the cycle of content creation has grown in all languages. So again, we get more content, more freshness, better results from the user. Google favors sites that offer better results. We're one of those, so we tend to rise in the rankings. I haven't seen, to give a follow-up to your question, haven't seen Google Places or Local, whatever they're calling it now, come out with any particularly interesting new features that we think are pulling traffic away from TripAdvisor. So again, stable. The integration they have with Zagat does appear more in the search results. Again, more on restaurants than hotels, so less meaningful to our business."

I mean the decline, I'm sorry, in conversion of our traffic. Where we get good data from clients on conversion, of course, we'd like to act upon it, we can make an intelligent conclusion. When we sliced and diced and said, hey, why is this conversion going down in certain markets is understandable, but other markets, it wasn't. And we've seen good growth in our SEM traffic year-over-year, sort of 2011 over '10 and '12 over '11. And so one of the things that we found when we sliced and diced is that some of the traffic that we were buying on SEM, and as I've said before, sometimes we will buy on a barely profitable basis in the mature market. We can appreciate how by buying a word at $0.50 and someone comes to the site and they click around, visit pages and then we sell the qualified user to our partner for $0.49, then I've bought a profitable visitor. I'm happy to do that all day long. The profit isn't much but it got me trial and that was a successful event for us. If it turns out that, that visitor, upon going to our client, actually bought something at only 1/2 the rate of our normal traffic, then it turns out that, that click to the client wasn't really worth $0.49 on average. It was only worth $0.25. Wait a minute. I paid -- I think I might've said that wrong but I paid. . ."

So that was part of the dimension that we discovered. And it's not like it was a bad thing for the business in general because we got someone to give TripAdvisor a try. They had a successful experience. They read a review, presumably, they went off and clicked on a client site but they didn't convert as much. And maybe it's because of this particular keyword that we were buying or the experience that we put them through as they landed on TripAdvisor. So our Q2 efforts, and I'm sure this is way more detailed than you were looking for, but the Q2 effort was really, hey, let's not buy as much of that traffic because it's not really meeting our objective of being, for that mature market, being profitable on every click that we're buying.

The second quarter completed a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We generated record quarterly revenue of $197 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, continued to grow traffic and hotel shoppers while taking important steps to optimize traffic quality and continued growing and leveraging our social and mobile initiatives to drive user adoption. We're making tremendous headway on content collection, membership and traffic. At the end of Q2, we passed the 75 million reviews and opinions milestone and our travel community continues to add content at 50 contributions per minute, which translated to an accelerated pace of more than 25 million contributions for 2012. Marketable member growth, travelers whom we have permission to e-mail on a regular basis, also accelerated during the quarter, growing over 25% to more than 32 million, up over 60% year-over-year. 
The top of our funnel, total traffic growth, also remained strong, as Q2 comScore data reflects an average of more than 54 million worldwide unique visitors to TripAdvisor sites, up more than 31% year-over-year. Further down the funnel, hotel shoppers, the key metric for our click-based revenue line, was up approximately 30% year-over-year and would've been higher were it not for a strategy change that I'll discuss in a minute. User engagement on the site was up as well, as we saw growth in time spent per session and page views per session, according to our internal log files. We attribute this growth in user engagement to our robust email campaigns and continued efforts to personalize the site experience. 
In Social, we are finding great ways to leverage the building blocks we put in place on the Facebook platform. In April, we merged our TripAdvisor and Cities I've Visited apps into one app, better integrating Facebook's users' activity within TripAdvisor and allowing friends to find TripAdvisor more easily on Facebook. In the first half of the year, TripAdvisor published more than 300 million actions generated from member activity on our website or using our App into Facebook's Open Graph. In June alone, we had over 32 million logged-in Facebook users use the TripAdvisor app or be instantly personalized on the site. This traffic level makes TripAdvisor the second most popular Facebook app, according to AppData. These efforts have been very successful in terms of brand awareness, content and community building, and growing our friend-connected member base. 
In addition to Social, our mobile initiatives continue to thrive as we continue to invest in and innovate on this fast-growing platform. During the quarter, we rolled out our new iPad app and introduced Facebook log-in functionality. We also launched 30 new free City Guides across iOS and Android, bringing our coverage to 50 cities. As of June 30, we reached over 22 million cumulative mobile app downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides and SeatGuru apps on smartphones and tablets, up more than 200% year-over-year. We also grew to more than 27 million monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor on mobile devices in May. Further, tablet continues to be our fastest grower in terms of mobile page views, sessions and unique users and accounts for more than 3/4 of our mobile revenue. We're obviously pleased with our mobile growth and we are focused on creating a more complete user experience on mobile, which will lead to an  even more loyal and engaged user community. 
One of the more interesting developments this quarter was our traffic quality improvement initiative, which spanned the quarter and affected all geographies. We leveraged our massive amount of user, click and traffic conversion data to identify traffic that converted well on TripAdvisor but didn't convert as well on partner sites. In other words, these are visitors who browsed a TripAdvisor site, clicked on a paid link to visit one of our clients, but ultimately didn't make a booking. While we get paid for that click, we know we aren't ultimately helping our clients make money. Using this information, we reduced our SEM spend on lower-performing traffic as we believe this will increase the conversion rate for our clients. Rather than reinvest this cost savings in search marketing, we chose to reallocate some of it towards our traffic diversification efforts, including our marketing campaigns on Facebook. This initiative lowered our hotel shopper growth, which translated into lower top line revenue growth, but also drove our improved Q2 EBITDA performance. Absent this strategy change, we would have seen higher Q2 hotel shopper growth, perhaps even accelerated growth from Q1, and revenue could have been approximately $5 million to $10 million higher. 
This traffic quality improvement strategy is another example of us doing what's right for the business, longer term, even at the expense of near-term growth. Whereas our site redesign last year helped -- improved user experience for our community, this initiative targets improved downstream conversion for our clients. We view this as a new steady state for our business as we strive to optimize and diversify our traffic sources but we can easily increase SEM spend if the opportunity arises. Despite this optimization, it's important to note that we continue to expect revenue growth in the high teens for 2012. However, our strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin performance should not be taken as a new run rate. We have captured just a fraction of the Global Travel market online and we remain firmly within an investment cycle focused on capturing worldwide market share. 
In other key investment areas we're pleased with the progress that we made during the first half of the year, our rest of the world growth remains strong and, notably, our APAC sales team was pleased to add Ctrip to our growing list of partners in that region. In our Subscription businesses, our Business Listing team has progressed nicely on their sales force hiring plan and rolled out a new mobile upgrade product as a value add for hoteliers and [indiscernible]. Finally, we're also executing nicely in our vacation rental business on TripAdvisor and on Holiday Lettings and FlipKey. 
In summary, we're tracking very well to our 2012 goals. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q2 results and our financial outlook."
140233,213580625,329918,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. T",1359,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. The 7-percentage-point sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth rate can be explained by 3 main factors: We benefited from increased conversion, more than offset by year-over-year decline in pricing and the traffic quality improvement strategy; we saw increased hotel shopper conversion in Q2 relative to Q1, albeit on a slightly lower hotel shopper growth rate. Even with the unfavorable trend in foreign exchange rates, overall CPCs were stable in Q2 as compared to Q1. 
We did see CPCs increase in the U.S. but this was offset by CPC decreases internationally. However, when looking at the year-over-year growth rates, sequentially, we had a tough pricing comp this past quarter compared to an easy pricing comp in the first quarter of this year. This accounted for 4 percentage points of the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. 
Finally, as Steve just described, we estimate that our traffic quality improvement strategy accounted for an additional 4 to 7 percentage points on the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. Lots of moving parts but the core fundamentals remained strong. 
Display-based advertising revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q2 to $26.6 million. The sequential deceleration was due in part to specific timing of ad purchases, including a unique customer buy during Q2 2011. Overall, our CPM prices increased slightly as compared to Q2 of last year. We continued to maintain a premium price in the CPM market and stable clickthrough rates, given our rich travel specific contents. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q2, growing 59% to $19.4 million, just slightly behind our expectations. In Business Listings, we continue to see a huge opportunity to diversify our customer base and develop a channel to distribute value-added products over the long term. Our near-term challenge is ramping sales execution on a global basis, such as connecting with a B&B in Vermont, while also building our relationship with a large independent hotel in Cancun, and concurrently determining the top domestic properties in Thailand. 
To that end, we are catching up to our aggressive sales force hiring plan and have seen encouraging productivity metrics. We remain focused on capturing the huge opportunity we have from Business Listings, as well as growing our vacation rentals product in 2012 and beyond. 
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 49% of total revenue during the second quarter compared to 48% in Q1 and 44% in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $63.3 million or 32% of revenue for the quarter, which is down sequentially in both absolute value and as a percentage of revenue. This was primarily due to lower SEM spend related to our strategy to increase traffic quality to our customers. We remain committed to making investments in our strategic growth opportunities and traffic diversification efforts. 
Given our year-to-date results, however, we expect non-GAAP sales and marketing spend to remain under 40% as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $19.1 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, which is up 17% sequentially, driven by additional headcount cost and in line with our expectations. We expect this expense line to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.8 million or 8% of revenue, in line with our expectations. Investment in our public company infrastructure is essentially complete, and we expect quarterly G&A expenses to be relatively stable on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.5 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $6.8 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 31.5% for the quarter. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with $478.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. In early May, the warrants we inherited from the spinoff were exercised for approximately $213 million. The warrant exercises were the primary driver of the uptick in our basic and fully diluted weighted average share counts for the period. 
Cash flow from operations was $61.8 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or low 30s as a percent of revenue. Q2 CapEx was 3% of revenue. Given our capital-efficient business model, we continue to expect this line item to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $55.8 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q2 with just over 1,400 employees, up from just over 1,300 employees at the end of Q1. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are global in scale and are focused on engineering and sales. Also, I'd like to provide a brief comment on foreign exchange impacts given the prevailing macroeconomic challenges overseas. As we've mentioned in the past, we forecast FX neutral based on current rates and do not try to anticipate movements in foreign exchange rates. Just over 20% of our revenue was denominated in euros and less than 10% in the British pound. A significant move in FX would have the greatest impact on revenue as we have natural hedges to help mitigate bottom line exposure. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. On the click-based revenue line, we are factoring in the Olympics and the continuation of our traffic quality improvement strategy as headwinds in Q3. We are also planning to roll out enhanced analytics for some of our large OTA partners on a test basis. Many of these customers have asked for more transparency in order to better understand the big landscape and in turn, increase their spend. We recognize the uncertainty this may present to our revenue results. While more transparency allows them to bid higher on their more profitable properties, it does come with a risk that clients will choose to optimize their spend without increasing revenue to TripAdvisor. 
In addition, we saw strong pricing in the second half of 2011 prior to the rollout of lower Expedia pricing at the end of the year. However, we expect continued strength in hotel shoppers and lapping of last year's site redesign to more than offset the potential headwinds I just described. Given all these dynamics, we currently expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year. 
Display-based revenue faces a tough comp in Q4 based on an unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. Given this and our year-to-date performance, we now expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display. We expect that full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth will be consistent with our year-to-date results. Importantly, early indicators for all these revenue lines are healthy as we continue to leverage our leadership position in the market. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars based on the better-than-expected results during the first half of the year. Given the strength in our core CPC business and reduced spend on SEM, we seek to reinvest all excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts. We are committed to driving long-term user growth and engagement in the business. 
In closing, the second quarter closed out a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor.

So as the teams have now built in the new formulas, if you will, into their model, now we get to move forward and optimize on those. So you could well see -- we would hope to see us just getting better at finding the right traffic that wants to not only convert on Trip but convert all the way downstream. So I don't think we'll be seeing a substantial additional cutback in the SEM versus now that we know the best spots to grow, we'll be able to reinvest some of those dollars in SEM itself."

Our customers aren't even necessarily asking for that level of information yet, but they do naturally want to know, at a granular level, at a property level, how the conversion rate, how the clicks on TripAdvisor share the market and in various bidding strategies that they can use to buy the traffic that works the best from their end. So we're going from a every couple of weeks, you can update a set of properties and looking to test out. And we really have to learn how to do this effectively, test out over time a model where we're providing our clients a lot more information. And I can absolutely appreciate how, from the client perspective, we're an extremely valuable channel to them and they would like to know how they can effectively spend more by buying the type of traffic that they want and that our current system is just too primitive, frankly, for them to be able to do so. We're approaching it gingerly in the sense that we don't have as many potential clients as someone like Google has, that could bid for words. It's harder still on our system. And the dynamic is on TripAdvisor, you're essentially mostly bidding for a dated search. It's not keyword match and it involves a specific availability question that our users are asking and Show Prices box. Well, everyone of course compares us to the Google auction that they have. Ours is in one way more complicated because we have to have the date information and in one way simpler, we don't have to deal with broad matching or exact phrase or anything like that, because we're bidding at the property level, not the keyword level.

For us, Facebook is -- it's an excellent branding effort. It brings in lots of members. It is extremely global for us. So that's really not at all a U.S. type initiative in search overseas. We think of Facebook as very global. We think of search in terms of brand-new markets or relatively low-penetration for TripAdvisor versus mature markets. So we'll tend to lump Europe, U.K., U.S., Canada and several others as more mature markets and the Thailand and the Poland and the Brazil as newer markets. So we tend to treat the ROI we expect on search at a different level, depending on if it's mature or new. For Facebook similarly, the advertising on Facebook, the pricing varies depending on the type of market that we're advertising in. But in general, we go very global on that platform. To the second question on reaction from the travel agencies to Business Listings, no, we're not detecting frankly any feedback worth mentioning from the OTAs on having Business Listings on the site, website link and e-mail, a phone number. That's something that I think they're very used to doing in their channels. They're always offering their benefits over to supplier direct. I presume all of the OTAs would not be very happy if TripAdvisor.star turned into a booking engine where we started actually taking the booking for hotel room and that's really not the media model that we're looking after. So we view VL as fantastic additional channel, marketing services or independent or chain hoteliers around the globe and restaurants and attractions and other owners for whom we, literally, we're just offering marketing services.

Thank God, they're wonderful, we get a ton of free traffic, we buy a bunch of paid traffic, but we like to have other sources and it was viewed as -- we view it as into our long-term success to generate our own domain direct -- higher rate of domain direct traffic and other sources by which people are learning about TripAdvisor. From the SEM decision to kind of cut back, you can look at the revenue -- you can look at the extra dollars, the millions of dollars that we've delivered on the bottom line that was above our own expectations and make the simple case that says, hey, we just should've spent it at even 50% ROI, spending $1 to make $0.50 and we could have bumped the top line up by millions of dollars. And that's a perfectly reasonable strategy. It's not the one we took because, in that case, I'm actually spending a chunk of money and losing it on search. And we've decided that we would rather, in our mature markets, spend those dollars, some of those dollars, on the more branding and membership acquisition channels and Facebook is one that we're calling out because we're finding it's working for us. So the working is a little more harder to quantify. It's not a direct ROI spend but we're getting the content. We're getting the Facebook-connected members, which is really driving in our wisdom of friends strategy to build the value proposition beyond just a quick, hey, let me check for you the hotel review and move on. So I can appreciate how some of these may be a bit of a surprise but I hope everyone can appreciate the balance of we have a lot of profit to spend, we could have chosen to invest it, in my view, unwisely in search, which would've generated more hotel shoppers and would've generated more top line revenue but less of the type of revenue that we're looking for, less of the longer term we have viewed as a valuable customer going forward. So proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years as the membership base grows and we continue to knock it out of the park in the content and collection space. But you can see in the quarter where we've spent and I guess the final part of my long-winded answer would be we would have spent more in the second quarter had we had enough of the campaigns set up on channels like Facebook because we're pleased that we have found some things that, to our metrics, are working for us."

I'm not sharing any surprises. We absolutely see what we believe to be the macroeconomic conditions in Europe being a drag on our revenue growth and our overall conversion growth. Hotel shoppers, interestingly enough, are doing okay in U.K. and Europe, not as strong as the U.S., but still, frankly, pretty strong, but the conversion of those shoppers to folks that are clicking to our clients is weaker than the U.S. And then on our client side, we're still seeing a pretty big hit there in terms of ad [ph] traffic actually booking and presumably if they're booking, maybe it's on cheaper property. So we see it as CPCs that come back to TripAdvisor and U.K. and EU is distinctly hurting compared to prior year. We frankly, we have no reason not to believe it's macroeconomic in nature as people are taking less expensive vacations and shopping around more as  opposed to buying more."

Depending on the type of keyword, they have a nice long session and read tons of reviews. Other times, they just do a quick price compare and depart. When they read the long reviews, we love it. We feel we've got a great brand impression and we presume that customer comes back more frequently than the one that just did a quick price compare and out the door. In most cases, we don't have a member at that point. We had a visit. And that's great from trial but less good from a long-term perspective. What we're doing on Facebook, it's almost the reverse. It really is not generating immediate revenue at all for us. It's not generating a lot of traffic to the site immediately, at least from the Facebook side of things. But it is generating a member that is interacting with our site or our app, our Cities I Visited app, who's generating content for us. We have an e-mail and we know who their friends are. So we're sharing the ratings, the reviews, the tips, the whatever across a broader set of people. So again, it's building up that Facebook-connected members that now hear from us every week, in whatever language they speak, almost. And we're able to tell them what their friends are doing. And we believe, and it will take a while to prove out, that those members upon seeing their friends interacting with TripAdvisor when they're ready to plan their next trip, come on back and do it on the site that they've been hearing about and that their friends are using TripAdvisor."

We continue to stay focused first on engagement but we see the in-market opportunity as being potentially meaningful down the road as we get to offer better marketing services to the restaurants and attractions that are in market versus the hotel purchase, which is the absolute lion's share of our revenue stream now. There's some internal debate as to how much online booking TripAdvisor is going to be a part of in the very front end hotel research experience, just because on the phone, the screen is so darn small or people are going to want to review the information that TripAdvisor has versus their tablet. And so to the tablet point, hey, we think tablet will mimic desktop and most of the strategies we have on desktop will be just as applicable on tablet and tablet could even become better as the user demographics of folks using tablets probably spend more than on desktop, in general.

So the CPC outlook, I would, say we did have some tougher comps, though when you look Q1 to Q2, it was basically flat, if I'm not mistaken, even though we had the CPC declines in Europe offset by CPC growth, pricing increase in the U.S. So you look at them and say, we think what we're doing, were it not for the macroeconomic climate in Europe, would be sending CPC prices higher across the board. And again, they're strong in many regions. We think that, that does have to do with our site redesign changes from last year, the quality improvements that we made on our SEM traffic this past quarter certainly contributing and just some other pieces of the site personalization efforts that we feel are driving higher qualified traffic to our clients. So going forward, I'm not going to be able to offer any prediction on the travel climate in Europe. Generally, when we forecast, we take the position of, all right, next quarter is going to have the same mood, the same FX, the same everything as what we have today. So if you guys are betting things are going to get better, then that will help us. If it's going to get worse, that will hurt us, where we believe ourselves to be reasonably sensitive to the overall economic climate. To your second question, algorithmic search results, we haven't seen much change by way of what Google's done in the past quarter. We don't think anything has affected us in a meaningful way. Certainly, we're pleased that we continue to have growth in our SEO channel, across, I've got to believe, all major markets. But we would absolutely expect that as the cycle of content creation has grown in all languages. So again, we get more content, more freshness, better results from the user. Google favors sites that offer better results. We're one of those, so we tend to rise in the rankings. I haven't seen, to give a follow-up to your question, haven't seen Google Places or Local, whatever they're calling it now, come out with any particularly interesting new features that we think are pulling traffic away from TripAdvisor. So again, stable. The integration they have with Zagat does appear more in the search results. Again, more on restaurants than hotels, so less meaningful to our business."

The second quarter completed a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We generated record quarterly revenue of $197 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, continued to grow traffic and hotel shoppers while taking important steps to optimize traffic quality and continued growing and leveraging our social and mobile initiatives to drive user adoption. We're making tremendous headway on content collection, membership and traffic. At the end of Q2, we passed the 75 million reviews and opinions milestone and our travel community continues to add content at 50 contributions per minute, which translated to an accelerated pace of more than 25 million contributions for 2012. Marketable member growth, travelers whom we have permission to e-mail on a regular basis, also accelerated during the quarter, growing over 25% to more than 32 million, up over 60% year-over-year. 
The top of our funnel, total traffic growth, also remained strong, as Q2 comScore data reflects an average of more than 54 million worldwide unique visitors to TripAdvisor sites, up more than 31% year-over-year. Further down the funnel, hotel shoppers, the key metric for our click-based revenue line, was up approximately 30% year-over-year and would've been higher were it not for a strategy change that I'll discuss in a minute. User engagement on the site was up as well, as we saw growth in time spent per session and page views per session, according to our internal log files. We attribute this growth in user engagement to our robust email campaigns and continued efforts to personalize the site experience. 
In Social, we are finding great ways to leverage the building blocks we put in place on the Facebook platform. In April, we merged our TripAdvisor and Cities I've Visited apps into one app, better integrating Facebook's users' activity within TripAdvisor and allowing friends to find TripAdvisor more easily on Facebook. In the first half of the year, TripAdvisor published more than 300 million actions generated from member activity on our website or using our App into Facebook's Open Graph. In June alone, we had over 32 million logged-in Facebook users use the TripAdvisor app or be instantly personalized on the site. This traffic level makes TripAdvisor the second most popular Facebook app, according to AppData. These efforts have been very successful in terms of brand awareness, content and community building, and growing our friend-connected member base. 
In addition to Social, our mobile initiatives continue to thrive as we continue to invest in and innovate on this fast-growing platform. During the quarter, we rolled out our new iPad app and introduced Facebook log-in functionality. We also launched 30 new free City Guides across iOS and Android, bringing our coverage to 50 cities. As of June 30, we reached over 22 million cumulative mobile app downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides and SeatGuru apps on smartphones and tablets, up more than 200% year-over-year. We also grew to more than 27 million monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor on mobile devices in May. Further, tablet continues to be our fastest grower in terms of mobile page views, sessions and unique users and accounts for more than 3/4 of our mobile revenue. We're obviously pleased with our mobile growth and we are focused on creating a more complete user experience on mobile, which will lead to an  even more loyal and engaged user community. 
One of the more interesting developments this quarter was our traffic quality improvement initiative, which spanned the quarter and affected all geographies. We leveraged our massive amount of user, click and traffic conversion data to identify traffic that converted well on TripAdvisor but didn't convert as well on partner sites. In other words, these are visitors who browsed a TripAdvisor site, clicked on a paid link to visit one of our clients, but ultimately didn't make a booking. While we get paid for that click, we know we aren't ultimately helping our clients make money. Using this information, we reduced our SEM spend on lower-performing traffic as we believe this will increase the conversion rate for our clients. Rather than reinvest this cost savings in search marketing, we chose to reallocate some of it towards our traffic diversification efforts, including our marketing campaigns on Facebook. This initiative lowered our hotel shopper growth, which translated into lower top line revenue growth, but also drove our improved Q2 EBITDA performance. Absent this strategy change, we would have seen higher Q2 hotel shopper growth, perhaps even accelerated growth from Q1, and revenue could have been approximately $5 million to $10 million higher. 
This traffic quality improvement strategy is another example of us doing what's right for the business, longer term, even at the expense of near-term growth. Whereas our site redesign last year helped improve user experience for our community, this initiative targets improved downstream conversion for our clients. We view this as a new steady state for our business as we strive to optimize and diversify our traffic sources but we can easily increase SEM spend if the opportunity arises. Despite this optimization, it's important to note that we continue to expect revenue growth in the high teens for 2012. However, our strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin performance should not be taken as a new run rate. We have captured just a fraction of the Global Travel market online and we remain firmly within an investment cycle focused on capturing worldwide market share. 
In other key investment areas we're pleased with the progress that we made during the first half of the year, our rest of the world growth remains strong and, notably, our APAC sales team was pleased to add Ctrip to our growing list of partners in that region. In our Subscription businesses, our Business Listing team has progressed nicely on their sales force hiring plan and rolled out a new mobile upgrade product as a value add for hoteliers and [indiscernible]. Finally, we're also executing nicely in our vacation rental business on TripAdvisor and on Holiday Lettings and FlipKey. 
In summary, we're tracking very well to our 2012 goals. 
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q2 results and our financial outlook."
140233,213580625,329953,"TripAdvisor Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Tripadvisor, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. T",1359,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. The 7-percentage-point sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth rate can be explained by 3 main factors: We benefited from increased conversion, more than offset by year-over-year decline in pricing and the traffic quality improvement strategy; we saw increased hotel shopper conversion in Q2 relative to Q1, albeit on a slightly lower hotel shopper growth rate. Even with the unfavorable trend in foreign exchange rates, overall CPCs were stable in Q2 as compared to Q1. 
We did see CPCs increase in the U.S. but this was offset by CPC decreases internationally. However, when looking at the year-over-year growth rates, sequentially, we had a tough pricing comp this past quarter compared to an easy pricing comp in the first quarter of this year. This accounted for 4 percentage points of the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. 
Finally, as Steve just described, we estimate that our traffic quality improvement strategy accounted for an additional 4 to 7 percentage points on the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. Lots of moving parts, but the core fundamentals remained strong. 
Display-based advertising revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q2 to $26.6 million. The sequential deceleration was due in part to specific timing of ad purchases, including a unique customer buy during Q2 2011. Overall, our CPM prices increased slightly as compared to Q2 of last year. We continued to maintain a premium price in the CPM market and stable click-through rates, given our rich travel specific contents. 
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q2, growing 59% to $19.4 million, just slightly behind our expectations. In Business Listings, we continue to see a huge opportunity to diversify our customer base and develop a channel to distribute value-added products over the long term. Our near-term challenge is ramping sales execution on a global basis, such as connecting with a B&B in Vermont, while also building our relationship with a large independent hotel in Cancun, and concurrently determining the top domestic properties in Thailand. 
To that end, we are catching up to our aggressive sales force hiring plan and have seen encouraging productivity metrics. We remain focused on capturing the huge opportunity we have from Business Listings, as well as growing our vacation rentals products in 2012 and beyond. 
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 49% of total revenue during the second quarter compared to 48% in Q1 and 44% in the second quarter of 2011. 
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $63.3 million or 32% of revenue for the quarter, which is down sequentially in both absolute value and as a percentage of revenue. This was primarily due to lower SEM spend related to our strategy to increase traffic quality to our customers. We remain committed to making investments in our strategic growth opportunities and traffic diversification efforts. 
Given our year-to-date results, however, we expect non-GAAP sales and marketing spend to remain under 40% as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $19.1 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, which is up 17% sequentially, driven by additional headcount cost and in line with our expectations. We expect this expense line to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. 
Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.8 million or 8% of revenue, in line with our expectations. Investment in our public company infrastructure is essentially complete, and we expect quarterly G&A expenses to be relatively stable on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.5 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $6.8 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation to be approximately 4% of revenue. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 31.5% for the quarter. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with $478.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. In early May, the warrants we inherited from the spinoff were exercised for approximately $213 million. The warrant exercises were the primary driver of the uptick in our basic and fully diluted weighted average share counts for the period. 
Cash flow from operations was $61.8 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or low 30s as a percent of revenue. Q2 CapEx was 3% of revenue. Given our capital-efficient business model, we continue to expect this line item to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $55.8 million of free cash flow during the quarter. 
In terms of headcount, we ended Q2 with just over 1,400 employees, up from just over 1,300 employees at the end of Q1. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are global in scale and are focused on engineering and sales. Also, I'd like to provide a brief comment on foreign exchange impacts given the prevailing macroeconomic challenges overseas. As we've mentioned in the past, we forecast FX neutral based on current rates and do not try to anticipate movements in foreign exchange rates. Just over 20% of our revenue was denominated in euros and less than 10% in the British pound. A significant move in FX would have the greatest impact on revenue as we have natural hedges to help mitigate bottom line exposure. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. On the click-based revenue line, we are factoring in the Olympics and the continuation of our traffic quality improvement strategy as headwinds in Q3. We are also planning to roll out enhanced analytics for some of our large OTA partners on a test basis. Many of these customers have asked for more transparency in order to better understand the big landscape and in turn, increase their spend. We recognize the uncertainty this may present to our revenue results. While more transparency allows them to bid higher on their more profitable properties, it does come with a risk that clients will choose to optimize their spend without increasing revenue to TripAdvisor. 
In addition, we saw strong pricing in the second half of 2011 prior to the rollout of lower Expedia pricing at the end of the year. However, we expect continued strength in hotel shoppers and lapping of last year's site redesign to more than offset the potential headwinds I just described. Given all these dynamics, we currently expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year. 
Display-based revenue faces a tough comp in Q4 based on an unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. Given this and our year-to-date performance, we now expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display. We expect that full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth will be consistent with our year-to-date results. Importantly, early indicators for all these revenue lines are healthy as we continue to leverage our leadership position in the market. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars based on the better-than-expected results during the first half of the year. Given the strength in our core CPC business and reduced spend on SEM, we seek to reinvest all excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts. We are committed to driving long-term user growth and engagement in the business. 
In closing, the second quarter closed out a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor.

So as the teams have now built in the new formulas, if you will, into their model, now we get to move forward and optimize on those. So you could well see -- we would hope to see us just getting better at finding the right traffic that wants to not only convert on Trip but convert all the way downstream.

We're not sure yet if we'll evolve all the way to a realtime. Our customers aren't even necessarily asking for that level of information yet, but they do naturally want to know, at a granular level, at a property level, how the conversion rate, how the clicks on TripAdvisor share the market and in various bidding strategies that they can use to buy the traffic that works the best from their end. So we're going from a every couple of weeks, you can update a set of properties and looking to test out. And we really have to learn how to do this effectively, test out over time a model where we're providing our clients a lot more information. And I can absolutely appreciate how, from the client perspective, we're an extremely valuable channel to them and they would like to know how they can effectively spend more by buying the type of traffic that they want and that our current system is just too primitive, frankly, for them to be able to do so. We're approaching it gingerly in the sense that we don't have as many potential clients as someone like Google has, that could bid for words. It's harder still on our system. And the dynamic is on TripAdvisor, you're essentially mostly bidding for a dated search. It's not keyword matched and it involves a specific availability question that our users are asking in the Show Prices box. So, while everyone, of course, compares us to the Google auction that they have, ours is in one way more complicated because we have to have the date information and in one way simpler. We don't have to deal with broad matching or exact phrase or anything like that, because we're bidding at the property level, not the keyword level. Hope that helps."

For us, Facebook is -- it's an excellent branding effort. It brings in lots of members. It is extremely global for us. So that's really not at all a U.S. type initiative in search overseas. We think of Facebook as very global. We think of search in terms of brand-new markets or relatively low-penetration for TripAdvisor versus mature markets. So we'll tend to lump Europe, U.K., U.S., Canada and several others as more mature markets and the Thailand and the Poland and the Brazil as newer markets. So we tend to treat the ROI we expect on search at a different level, depending on if it's mature or new. For Facebook similarly, the advertising on Facebook, the pricing varies depending on the type of market that we're advertising in. But in general, we go very global on that platform. To the second question on reaction from the travel agencies to Business Listings, no, we're not detecting frankly any feedback worth mentioning from the OTAs on having Business Listings on the site, website link and e-mail, a phone number. That's something that I think they're very used to doing in their channels. They're always offering their benefits over to supplier direct. I presume all of the OTAs would not be very happy if TripAdvisor.star turned into a booking engine where we started actually taking the booking for a hotel room and that's really not the media model that we're looking after. So we view VL as fantastic additional channel, marketing services or independent or chain hoteliers around the globe and restaurants and attractions and other owners for whom we, literally, we're just offering marketing services. So that was a long answer to the simple question saying no, no negative reactions to OTAs for VL."

So we've been talking for a while about diversifying our traffic sources. So search engines, as you know, are a significant source. Thank God, they're wonderful, we get a ton of free traffic, we buy a bunch of paid traffic, but we like to have other sources and it was viewed as -- we view it as into our long-term success to generate our own domain direct -- higher rate of domain direct traffic and other sources by which people are learning about TripAdvisor. From the SEM decision to kind of cut back, you can look at the revenue -- you can look at the extra dollars, the millions of dollars that we've delivered on the bottom line that was above our own expectations and make the simple case that says, hey, we just should've spent it at even 50% ROI, spending $1 to make $0.50 and we could have bumped the top line up by millions of dollars. And that's a perfectly reasonable strategy. It's not the one we took because, in that case, I'm actually spending a chunk of money and losing it on search. And we've decided that we would rather, in our mature markets, spend those dollars, some of those dollars, on the more branding and membership acquisition channels and Facebook is one that we're calling out because we're finding it's working for us. So the working is a little more harder to quantify. It's not a direct ROI spend but we're getting the content. We're getting the Facebook-connected members, which is really driving in our wisdom of friends strategy to build the value proposition beyond just a quick, hey, let me check, read the hotel review and move on. So I can appreciate how some of this may be a bit of a surprise but I hope everyone can appreciate the balance of we have a lot of profit to spend, we could have chosen to invest it, in my view, unwisely in search, which would've generated more hotel shoppers and would've generated more top line revenue but less of the type of revenue that we're looking for, less of the longer term we have you as a valuable customer going forward. So the proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years as the membership base grows and we continue to knock it out of the park in the content and collection space. But you can see in the quarter where we've spent and I guess the final part of my long-winded answer would be we would have spent more in the second quarter had we had enough of the campaigns set up on channels like Facebook because we're pleased that we have found some things that, to our metrics, are working for us."

We continue to stay focused first on engagement but we see the in-market opportunity as being potentially meaningful down the road as we get to offer better marketing services to the restaurants and attractions that are in market versus the hotel purchase, which is the absolute lion's share of our revenue stream now. There's some internal debate as to how much online booking TripAdvisor is going to be a part of in the very front end hotel research experience, just because on the phone, the screen is so darn small are people going to want to review the information that TripAdvisor has versus their tablet. And so to the tablet point, hey, we think tablet will mimic desktop and most of the strategies we have on desktop will be just as applicable on tablet and tablet could even become better as the user demographics of folks using tablets probably spend more than on desktop, in general. So short answer is at the moment, it's more engagement and functionality but we do believe that mobile will become, a phone will become a much more interesting revenue stream for us in the outgoing years."

Two good questions. So the CPC outlook, I would, say we did have some tougher comps, though when you look Q1 to Q2, it was basically flat, if I'm not mistaken, even though we had the CPC declines in Europe offset by CPC growth, pricing increased in the U.S. So you look at them and say, we think what we're doing, were it not for the macroeconomic climate in Europe, would be sending CPC prices higher across the board. And again, they're strong in many regions. We think that, that does have to do with our site redesign changes from last year, the quality improvements that we made on our SEM traffic this past quarter certainly contributing and just some other pieces of the site personalization efforts that we feel are driving higher qualified traffic to our clients. So going forward, I'm not going to be able to offer any prediction on the travel climate in Europe. Generally, when we forecast, we take the position of, all right, next quarter is going to have the same mood, the same FX, the same everything as what we have today. So if you guys are betting things are going to get better, then that will help us. If it's going to get worse, that will hurt us. We believe ourselves to be reasonably sensitive to the overall economic climate. To your second question, algorithmic search results, we haven't seen much change by way of what Google's done in the past quarter. We don't think anything has affected us in a meaningful way. Certainly, we're pleased that we continue to have growth in our SEO channel, across, I've got to believe, all major markets. But we would absolutely expect that as the cycle of content creation has grown in all languages. So again, we get more content, more freshness, better results from the user. Google favors sites that offer better results. We're one of those, so we tend to rise in the rankings. I haven't seen, to give a follow-up to your question, haven't seen Google Places or Local, whatever they're calling it now, come out with any particularly interesting new features that we think are pulling traffic away from TripAdvisor. So again, stable. The integration they have with Zagat does appear more in the search results. Again, more on restaurants than hotels, so less meaningful to our business."

I mean a decline, I'm sorry, in conversion of our traffic. Where we get good data from clients on conversion, of course, we'd like to act upon it and make an intelligent conclusion. When we sliced and diced and said, hey, why is this conversion going down? In certain markets is understandable, but other markets, it wasn't. And we've seen good growth in our SEM traffic year-over-year, sort of 2011 over '10 and '12 over '11. And so one of the things that we found when we sliced and diced is that some of the traffic that we were buying on SEM, and as I've said before, sometimes we will buy on a barely profitable basis in a mature market. We can appreciate how by buying a word at $0.50 and someone comes to the site and they click around, visit pages and then we sell the qualified user to our partner for $0.49, then I've bought a profitable visitor. I'm happy to do that all day long. The profit isn't much but it got me trial and that was a successful event for us. If it turns out that, that visitor, upon going to our client, actually bought something at only 1/2 the rate of our normal traffic, then it turns out that, that click to the client wasn't really worth $0.49 on average. It was only worth $0.25. Wait a minute. I paid -- I think I might've said that wrong but I paid. . ."

So that was part of the dimension that we discovered. And it's not like it was a bad thing for the business in general because we got someone to give TripAdvisor a try. They had a successful experience. They read a review, presumably, they went off and clicked on a client site but they didn't convert as much. And maybe it's because of this particular keyword that we were buying or the experience that we put them through as they landed on TripAdvisor. So our Q2 efforts, and I'm sure this is way more detailed than you were looking for, but the Q2 effort was really, hey, let's not buy as much of that traffic because it's not really meeting our objective of being, for that mature market, being profitable on every click that we're buying.

Before starting, on behalf of the entire at TripAdvisor Media Group family, are far so with everyone that has been impacted by here again Sandy. Special thanks goes out to those of you on the Northeast Region for joining us today. 
I'm happy to report that TripAdvisor had a strong third quarter. We generated record quarterly revenue of $212.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $107.1 million. Across the globe, traffic to our site continues to be strong, as total traffic to TripAdvisor sites grew in the mid-30s, and even more importantly, our hotel shoppers have continued to grow at approximately 30% based on our log files.
I'm also pleased that we made great progress this quarter, rapidly innovating the TripAdvisor experience for both our users and our advertising partners alike. 
Our core click-based revenue accelerated, growing 15% year-over-year, based on continued strong hotel shopper growth. This revenue growth can also be attributed to improvements in our on-site conversion and personalization efforts, offset by a still week yet stabilizing Southern European market. Unique to the third quarter, we estimate that the Summer Olympics had a 2% negative impact on hotel shopper traffic in click-based revenue.
We were also pleased to see a 5% to 6% uplift in click-based revenue very late in the quarter, when we left last year's site redesign. We expect this uplift to continue in the coming quarters.
Other most exciting things to see is the continued strong growth in deep engagement of our growing traveler community. Our remarkable members grew to over 70% year-over-year to more than 36 million, fueling our robust and growing e-mail campaigns. Our members love sharing their travel expenses with other travelers and friends, and they continue to share content in 21 different languages at a remarkable rate of more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year. 
During the third quarter, we were thrilled to announce content syndication agreements with Best Western and with Wyndham Hotels Group. The Wyndham partnership, which has been expanded to 15 of their hotel brands, also includes a review collection agreement, where Wyndham will encourage their guests to share their expenses to a postdate e-mail and survey powered by TripAdvisor. 
Including these latest wins, we now syndicate our travel and reviews to more than 500 major travel partners, including more than 50 hotel chains, reinforcing and enhancing the visibility of the TripAdvisor brand as the fact of standard for travel research.
We also appreciate that tens of thousands of individual business owners around the world proudly display their review on TripAdvisor stickers, their certificates of excellence and the travelers choice plaques on-site at their hotels, restaurants and attractions. The brand fly lease is coming, but the TripAdvisor site accounting for only 10% of online travel uniques, we have a lot of runway left for continued growth and adoption.
In TripAdvisor, we are always innovating our products and extensively testing and discovering new ways to improve site usability and experience for our users. We strive to create the very best experience for every user, on every device, in every geography. You can see this in our social and personalization initiatives, great vehicles to which we learn about our users, their friends and their preferences, all of which enable us to deliver more satisfying, inspiring and customized travel planning experience for everyone.
Along these lines, we continue to leverage the Facebook platform and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to welcome aboard, via acquisition, the talented team from Wanderfly, whose focused on blending inspiration, personalization and social nicely complement our ongoing efforts.
In addition to social and personalization, mobile is a key area of focus and investment as we innovate to deliver the best user experience in every device. Year-over-year, we've seen downloads over smartphones and tablets apps more than double, reaching more than 26 million total downloads. Over the same timeframe, our average monthly mobile uniques are up over 130%, more than 35 million according to our own log files. 
We rolled out an improved tablet interface during the quarter and have seen tablet monetization improve nicely since earlier this year. It's now more closely resembling desktop, an important trend, given that tablet comprises about 3/4 of our mobile revenue. 
On the other hand, smartphone monetization isn't growing as quickly as tablet monetization, which is not surprising to us, given the use case and form factor of that device. 
During Q3, we began testing hotel meta display on smartphones, an exciting step towards optimizing the user experience. Similar to our flights product, user interface shows partner prices and availability in line, allowing a hotel shopper to more easily compare booking options. The tests are progressing well. And borrowing any unforeseen challenges, we expect to roll out hotel meta display to all phone traffic later this quarter.
For us, phone is all about optimizing the user experience. And we expect over time, this innovation will drive better user engagement, better conversion and therefore come better monetization on the phone smaller real estate.
Now the logical question to ask is, are we planning to roll out a meta display to all users on all platforms on all geographies? And the answer is we don't know yet. We think the meta experience on phone makes a lot of sense and it's worth testing on desktop, but we aren't making any commitments beyond testing at this point. We've contemplated a meta display for years. And as with all of our product releases, there are 3 main things that we consider: Is it good for the user experience? Is it good for our clients? And what does it do for TripAdvisor economics? We always weigh these factors very carefully, and our objective is to find the solution that works best for all 3.
As it relates to our OTA and hoteliers partners, looking at the global landscape, we've seen improvements throughout Q3, especially in our new international markets. 
In the MEA, we added Germany hotels to our growing list of partners in the Middle East. In APAC, we added 3 new regional Asian OTAs, including Asia rooms. On the bidding side, we started testing property rank reporting with a select set of major OTA clients and 3 test markets in early October. And while the testing has begun, we have not been surprised by any of their results so far.
The goal of providing these results is that allow partners the chance to better understand there are a light on TripAdvisor and help them rationalize higher per unit or per click spend. We expect the test to be successful and expect to have minimum CTC per property thresholds in place in early 2013. At that point, we would consider moving to worldwide roll-out.
Turning our relatively short history as a public company, you've heard us describe a few initiatives we've undertaken to strategically position TripAdvisor for the long-term. 
The site redesign to more traffic quality improvement measures, the data sharing of large partners and our new meta interface on smartphones, we remain focused on optimizing user experience and enhancing client satisfaction and maximizing TripAdvisor economics over the long term. This has been TripAdvisor's DNA since inception.
In summary, we have a great quarter. We're squarely on track to deliver, to achieve our 2012 business objectives and are excited about how we position the business for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q3 results and our financial outlook."

Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $212.7 million, in line with our expectations. Assuming constant currency, revenue would have been 4% higher. Click-based revenue was up 15% year-over-yea",858,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $212.7 million, in line with our expectations. 
Assuming constant currency, revenue would have been 4% higher. Click-based revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $168 million. When comparing year-over-year hotel shopper growth, approximately 30%, to click-based revenue growth, please note that revenue growth this past quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 5% from foreign exchange; 5% to 6% from last year's site redesign; and 3% to 5% from the spin-related Expedia pricing changes. Additionally, as Steve mentioned, we believe that our hotel shopper traffic and revenue would have been 2% higher, were it not for the lower traffic during the Summer Olympics.
Display-based advertising revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $23.6 million, driven by solid growth in the Americas, offset by weakness in EMEA, due to persistent macroeconomic softness in Southern Europe. Assuming constant currency, display-based revenue would have been 2% higher.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes business listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a solid Q3, growing 53% to $21.1 million. 
In business listings, new sales reps are ramping globally, and we expect to see continued productivity improvements as we enter 2013.
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 50% of total revenue during the third quarter, compared to 49% in Q2 and 47% in the third quarter of 2011.
In general, we saw a quick growth accelerate in our core market. And on the pricing side, we saw stabilizing to improving pricing abroad. Specifically, in EMEA, we saw accelerating growth in the U.K. despite a persistently tough pricing environment. Also, Southern Europe, although still week, showed encouraging signs of pricing stabilization.
Our newer Russian market remains in hypergrowth mode, albeit growing off a smaller base. In our fast-growing Latin America and APAC market, we saw continued strong hotel shopper growth and solid pricing trend, driven by a stronger coverage, traffic acquisition, brand-building and content collection initiative. Notably, Brazil remains in hypergrowth mode as well. And to put it into perspective, is fast approaching Spain and Italy in terms of click-based revenue.
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses was $66.5 million, or 31% of revenue for the quarter, consistent sequentially on a percentage of revenue basis. Given that Q4 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to see deleveraging in our non-GAAP sales and marketing spend. This translates into sales and marketing spend in the high 30s to low 40s as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter, and mid-30s, as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012.
Moving forward, we continue to prior -- prioritize traffic diversification, international expansion, and the hotel shopper growth, as we identify under leveraged marketing channels to meet these growth objectives.
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $20.3 million, or 10% of revenue for the quarter, and non-GAAP G&A expenses were $16 million or 8% of revenue. Both were in line with our expectations, and we expect these expense lines to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis in Q4.
Our Q3 effective tax rate of 34.4% was higher than we expected, due to an income mix shift towards jurisdictions with higher statutory rates, as well as an increased in valuation allowance for one of our U.S. subsidiaries. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain largely consistent with our year-to-date rates.
Cash flow from operations were strong at $76.5 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes, or low 30s as a percentage of revenue. In terms of headcount, we ended Q3 with 1,483 employees, up from 1,444 employees at June 30, and 1,196 at the end of Q3 2011.
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Given our year-to-date performance, we continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high-teens. Driven mainly by continued strong hotel shopper growth and the tailwinds created from lapping last year's site redesign, we now expect click-based revenue growth to be in the high-teens for the full year. 
While fourth quarter to date volume and conversion remain strong, pricing continues to be a headwind, given the persistent macroeconomic softness overseas, as well as the fact that we are still comping higher pre spin Expedia pricing. We continue to expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display-based revenue, as it faces a tough Q4 comp based on unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. We also expect full year subscription transaction and other revenue growth to be consistent with our year-to-date results.
Based on our continued profitability outperformance, we now expect full year 2012 adjusted EBITDA growth in the high-single digits. We are in the midst of our 2013 planning process and will provide our expectations for next year on our Q4 calls.
In closing, our year-to-date performance keep us well on track achieve our 2012 goals. We'll now open the call up to your questions."

What we're saying is the -- when the phrase mobile is used, we often refer to both tablet and phone, and that 3/4 of revenue generated from tablet of phones remains on the tablet. We've seen some improvements in our monetization rate on the tablet. That's all good. And it's kind of what I had told you we expected to see over time, as the tablet usage much more closely resembles desktop. On the phone, we haven't seen a meaningful change in the monetization rate i.e., it's still a very small percentage of desktop. And we think it's form factor. We think it's in-market activity. We think it's folks who are thinking about the trip, checking out some hotels and some more -- whatever, who just aren't ready to actually spend the money right then and there because our typical usage pattern is not last-minute landed in the city near your hotel room that some other apps may have. So we've introduced, from a testing perspective, the meta display to the smartphones because we think that's just a much better experience when someone wants to check the prices and do that based or a research. Because we're showing the prices in line, we think the conversion of rate at the leads would be higher downstream, so the overall monetization rate of that display will be better for us. And I'm just cautioning that in that mobile environment. A, it's a small part of our traffic. B, it's clearly monetizing small part of our traffic. So the shift from the current monetization model through a meta display on phone isn't a particularly material financial event for us."

So we're working on it. There's a lot of lower tax rate and it is definitely part of our strategy going forward. Regarding the EBITDA margins, I want to remind you that we did not give that 42% to 47%. It was not guidance and/or long-term target model. It was just to illustrate the effect of the spend on our 2010 numbers. So we've had things like the additional G&A cost, the decrease in Expedia pricing. Those -- that impact was applied against 2010 just to give an of model. We are in the process of -- we've had a lot of movements in 2013, and excuse me, in 2012.

The site redesign is probably the largest one. As Steve mentioned, we lapsed that at the end of Q3. At that time, we were able to clearly see that it had negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by about 5% to 6%. So we would expect that trend to continue forward into Q4 and beyond.

So on bank reporting, I haven't heard any feedback from any of our test partners that say, ""Thanks, but no thanks, we weren't really interested in this information."" I think we more hear, ""Wow, it's a lot of information, it's a lot",422,"Sure. 2 good questions. So on bank reporting, I haven't heard any feedback from any of our test partners that say, ""Thanks, but no thanks, we weren't really interested in this information."" I think we more hear, ""Wow, it's a lot of information, it's a lot to digest."" To put it into perspective and we have a client that's bidding on 100,000 properties times, call it, 20 different markets, that's just a lot of data to digest and make sense of. So we're having to be measured in our roll out for our client request basically. So I don't -- it's a little hard for me to imagine that situation where over time, we don't have this information available to everyone. But I'm a lot more cautious about trying to predict in which quarter it will be both available and consumed for everyone. To your second part of your question, lifetime value of the reviews. We hardly agree the 6-year-old review is perhaps nice to have on the site because it mentioned something that's unique to that review, a tip in the neighborhood or something like that, climbing on top of the hill to watch a beautiful sunset. The 6-year-old review really isn't part of our popularity index calculation anymore either Because it's so old and so much can change in the 6 years. Similarly, we have some hotels north of 8,000 review. And they may be all current but you still don't need 8,000 to have a lot of liquidity of opinion for that property. The beauty of what we're able to do with generating so many more reviews is sort of provide fantastic coverage on, not only the top properties in the city, but kind of all the properties in the city, the country, all the restaurants. So it's getting to the point where it's tough to find a hotel with the less than 50 reviews. And that's what we're getting pretty excited about because everyone can look at 5 reviews on a property and say, ""What's the big deal?"" With 50, you start to really understand what you're going to get when you stay there.  And the same applies restaurant and the same applies to tools and attractions and museums and everything else that goes into what folks are looking at. So sure, if you took the 6-year-old reviews off the site, no one would notice. The volume was so small anyways. it practically doesn't matter. We keep them on just as a convenient function for our current customers."

While some other apps or the OTA apps, if you find yourself in a city and you need a hotel room and you haven't done any advanced planning, you're just probably more in the ""Hey, find me something close to where I am, and I'm going to book it and an OTA web app -- an OTA app can do that for you quite well.

I'll try to be reasonably clear that we don't view it as a very large traffic acquisition channel. Certainly, not compared to a channel like Search.

And in many times, they're interested in interacting with our been, with our Cities I Visited or seeing status update from a friend about the trips that they've taken. Cities I've visited they did up to use it here joining TripAdvisor and you're telling us something about yourself, namely all of the different places that you've been. You're also giving us your friend network so that we can share all those places that you've been as data when your friends come and browse on TripAdvisor. We cap Facebook as a member acquisition channel, is quite strong for us because we spend a certain amount to advertise our map and TripAdvisor applications. We get a certain uptake. That's had a somewhat expensive rate, sort of qualitative because it's just a member, it's not a travel booking yet. But because of what those folks are doing with the app, it's generating invitations to other users. It's generating status feeds. It's generating open raft items.

So we continue our spent and that channel because it helps us grow our membership and it helps us grow our social content namely knowing where your friends had been to in order to make progress on our social and personalization efforts, which I've touched upon.

So on the Expedia Agency business, we're certainly aware of their offering choice to their consumers. We don't have inside information, but it stands to reason one of the opportunities for them is to increase their conversion rate even if the margin or the finances behind it might be different. And I say might because again I'm not part of it. Our respective interests are perfectly aligned because if offering the payout checkout feature improves conversion, then they're making more money per, not necessarily per booking, but per lead I send them because of the higher conversion rate. Therefore, they can afford to pay me as much as they were before or even more, if they dip into some of their efficiency numbers. So we don't view the percentage uptake of their agency business as bad in any way, should it be strong in certain markets. If it helps, another way to look at it is if it helps them to be competitive in certain markets, where they didn't have the product offering before, fantastic, because then they'll be able to bid more for traffic in those markets. Again, the conversion rate is expected to make up for any loss in merchant revenues. It's actually a little bit related to the OTA conversion, the second part of your question. So when we look at the leads that we send to our clients, I don't really ask them, are my leads better converting than a Google or somebody else? I look to see on a per dollar spend basis, do we generate more profit for you folks than your other channels? And we continue to hear that our clients are bidding independently i.e. they're not favoring TripAdvisor over Google or vice versa, they'll spend whenever they can get the best ROI. So if a TripAdvisor lead converts of that twice the rate of a Google lead, then they're probably paying twice as much for it, then the converse is true to we are comparing the actual CPC, or the actual conversion independently that we the question you want to ask. It's of the ""Hey, how's the efficiency of TripAdvisor as a traffic source to these clients. "" And while every one of our clients, no doubt, would like an even more efficient source, they're all free to lower the bits at any point, which will get them less traffic, but presumably, a little bit more efficient. And they're not doing that. So Dave -- it's always changing, but seems like they found a happy balance in terms of the efficiency that they're willing to spend on TripAdvisor and the conversion that, that drives."

I'm happy to report that TripAdvisor had a strong third quarter. We generated record quarterly revenue of $212.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $107.1 million. Across the globe, traffic to our site continues to be strong as total traffic to TripAdvisor sites grew in the mid-30s and, even more importantly, our hotel shoppers have continued to grow at approximately 30% based on our log files.
I'm also pleased that we made great progress this quarter rapidly innovating the TripAdvisor experience for both our users and our advertising partners alike. 
Our core click-based revenue accelerated, growing 15% year-over-year based on continued strong hotel shopper growth. This revenue growth can also be attributed to improvements in our on-site conversion and personalization efforts, offset by a still weak, yet stabilizing, Southern European market. Unique to the third quarter, we estimate that the Summer Olympics had a 2% negative impact on hotel shopper traffic in click-based revenue.
We were also pleased to see a 5% to 6% uplift in click-based revenue very late in the quarter when we lapped last year's site redesign. We expect this uplift to continue in the coming quarters.
One of the most exciting things to see is the continued strong growth and deep engagement of our growing traveler community. Our marketable members grew over 70% year-over-year to more than 36 million, fueling our robust and growing email campaigns. Our members love sharing their travel expenses with other travelers and friends, and they continue to share content in 21 different languages at a remarkable rate of more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year. 
During the third quarter, we were thrilled to announce content syndication agreements with Best Western and with Wyndham Hotels Group. The Wyndham partnership, which has been expanded to 15 of their hotel brands, also includes a review collection agreement, where Wyndham will encourage their guests to share their expenses through a post date email and survey powered by TripAdvisor. Including these latest wins, we now syndicate our traveler reviews to more than 500 major travel partners, including more than 50 hotel chains, reinforcing and enhancing the visibility of the TripAdvisor brand as the de facto standard for travel research.
We also appreciate that tens of thousands of individual business owners around the world proudly display their reviewed on TripAdvisor stickers, their certificates of excellence and their Travelers' Choice plaques on-site at their hotels, restaurants and attractions. The brand flywheel is humming, but with TripAdvisor site accounting for only 10% of online travel uniques, we have a lot of runway left for continued growth and adoption.
In TripAdvisor, we are always innovating our products and extensively testing and discovering new ways to improve site usability and experience for our users. We strive to create the very best experience for every user, on every device, in every geography. You can see this in our social and personalization initiatives, great vehicles through which we learn about our users, their friends and their preferences, all of which enable us to deliver more satisfying, inspiring and customized travel planning experience for everyone.
Along these lines, we continue to leverage the Facebook platform and, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to welcome aboard via acquisition the talented team from Wanderfly, whose focus on blending inspiration, personalization and social nicely complement our ongoing efforts.
In addition to social and personalization, mobile is a key area of focus and investment as we innovate to deliver the best user experience on every device. Year-over-year, we've seen downloads of our smartphone and tablet apps more than double, reaching more than 26 million total downloads. Over the same time frame, our average monthly mobile uniques are up over 130%, more than 35 million, according to our own log files. 
We rolled out an improved tablet interface during the quarter and have seen tablet monetization improve nicely since the -- since earlier this year. It's now more closely resembling desktop, an important trend given that tablet comprises about 3/4 of our mobile revenue. 
On the other hand, smartphone monetization isn't growing as quickly as tablet monetization, which is not surprising to us given the use case and form factor of that device. 
During Q3, we began testing hotel meta display on smartphones, an exciting step towards optimizing the user experience. Similar to our Flights product, user interface shows partner prices and availability in line, allowing a hotel shopper to more easily compare booking options. The tests are progressing well, and barring any unforeseen challenges, we expect to roll out hotel meta display to all phone traffic later this quarter.
For us, the phone is all about optimizing the user experience. And we expect over time, this innovation will drive better user engagement, better conversion and, therefore, better monetization on the phone's smaller real estate.
Now the logical question to ask is, are we planning to roll out a meta display to all users on all platforms in all geographies. And the answer is we don't know yet. We think the meta experience on phone makes a lot of sense and is worth testing on desktop, but we aren't making any commitments beyond testing at this point. 
We've contemplated a meta display for years. And as with all of our product releases, there are 3 main things that we consider: Is it good for the user experience? Is it good for our clients? And what does it do for TripAdvisor economics? We always weigh these factors very carefully, and our objective is to find the solution that works best for all 3.
As it relates to our OTA and hoteliers partners, looking at the global landscape, we  have seen improvements throughout Q3, especially in our newer international markets. 
In EMEA, we added Geremia hotels to our growing list of partners in the Middle East. In APAC, we added 3 new regional Asian OTAs, including asiarooms. On the bidding side, we started testing property rank reporting with a select set of major OTA clients in 3 test markets in early October. And while the testing has begun, we have not been surprised by any of the results so far. The goal of providing these reports is to allow partners the chance to better understand they're our ally [ph], TripAdvisor, and help them rationalize higher per-unit or per-click spend. We expect the test to be successful and expect to have minimum CPC per property thresholds in place in early 2013. At that point, we would consider moving to a worldwide rollout.
During our relatively short history as a public company, you've heard us describe a few initiatives we've undertaken to strategically position TripAdvisor for the long term. From our site redesign to our traffic quality improvement measures, the data sharing with large partners and our new meta interface on smartphones, we remain focused on optimizing user experience, enhancing client satisfaction and maximizing TripAdvisor economics over the long term. This has been TripAdvisor's DNA since inception.
In summary, we had a great quarter. We're squarely on track to deliver, to achieve our 2012 business objectives and are excited about how we position the business for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q3 results and our financial outlook."

Assuming constant currency, revenue would have been 4% higher. 
Click-based revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $168 million. When comparing year-over-year hotel shopper growth, approximately 30%, to click-based revenue growth, please note that revenue growth this past quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 5% from foreign exchange, 5% to 6% from last year's site redesign and 3% to 5% from the spin-related Expedia pricing changes. Additionally, as Steve mentioned, we believe that our hotel shopper traffic and revenue would have been 2% higher were it not for the lower traffic during the Summer Olympics.
Display-based advertising revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $23.6 million, driven by solid growth in the Americas, offset by weakness in EMEA due to persistent macroeconomic softness in Southern Europe. Assuming constant currency, display-based revenue would have been 2% higher.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes business listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a solid Q3, growing 53% to $21.1 million. In business listings, new sales reps are ramping globally, and we expect to see continued productivity improvements as we enter 2013.
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 50% of total revenue during the third quarter, compared to 49% in Q2 and 47% in the third quarter of 2011.
In general, we saw a quick growth accelerate in our core markets. And on the pricing side, we saw stabilizing to improving pricing abroad. Specifically in EMEA, we saw accelerating growth in the U.K. despite a persistently tough pricing environment. Also, Southern Europe, although still weak, showed encouraging signs of pricing stabilization. Our newer Russian market remains in hyper-growth mode, albeit growing off a smaller base. In our fast-growing Latin America and APAC markets, we saw continued strong hotel shopper growth and solid pricing trends, driven by stronger coverage, traffic acquisition, brand building and content collection initiatives. Notably, Brazil remains in a hyper-growth mode as well. And to put it into perspective, it's fast approaching Spain and Italy in terms of click-based revenue.
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.5 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter, consistent sequentially on a percentage of revenue basis. Given that Q4 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to see deleveraging in our non-GAAP sales and marketing spend. This translates into sales and marketing spend in the high 30s to low 40s as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter and mid-30s as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Moving forward, we continue to prioritize traffic diversification, international expansion and a hotel shopper growth as we identify underleveraged marketing channels to meet these growth objectives.
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $20.3 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, and non-GAAP G&A expenses were $16 million or 8% of revenue. Both were in line with our expectations, and we expect these expense lines to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis in Q4.
Our Q3 effective tax rate of 34.4% was higher than we expected due to an income mix shift towards jurisdictions with higher statutory rates, as well as an increase in valuation allowance for one of our U.S. subsidiaries. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively consistent with our year-to-date rate.
Cash flow from operations was strong at $76.5 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes, or low 30s as a percentage of revenue. In terms of headcount, we ended Q3 with 1,483 employees, up from 1,444 employees at June 30 and 1,196 at the end of Q3 2011.
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Given our year-to-date performance, we continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. Driven mainly by continued strong hotel shopper growth and the tailwinds created from lapping last year's site redesign, we now expect click-based revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year. 
While fourth quarter-to-date volume and conversion remained strong, pricing continues to be a headwind given the persistent macroeconomic softness overseas, as well as the fact that we are still comping higher pre-spin Expedia pricing. We continue to expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display-based revenue as it faces a tough Q4 comp based on unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. We also expect full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth to be consistent with our year-to-date results.
Based on our continued profitability outperformance, we now expect full year 2012 adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single digits. 
We are in the midst of our 2013 planning process and will provide our expectations for next year on our Q4 call.
In closing, our year-to-date performance keeps us well on track achieve our 2012 goals. We'll now open the call up to your questions."

On the phone, we haven't seen a meaningful change in the monetization rate, i.e., it's still a very small percentage of desktop. And we think it's form factor. We think it's market activity. We think it's folks who are thinking about the trip, checking out some hotels and some -- whatever who just aren't ready to actually spend the money right then and there because our typical usage pattern is not ""Last minute landed in the city near your hotel room"" that some other apps may have. So we've introduced, from a testing perspective, the meta display to the smartphones because we think that's just a much better experience when someone wants to check the prices and do that base level of research. Because we're showing the prices in line, we think the conversion rate of the leads will be higher downstream. So the overall monetization rate of that display will be better for us. And I'm just cautioning that in that mobile environment, a, it's a small part of our traffic; b, it's a poorly monetizing, small part of our traffic. So the shift from the current monetization model to a meta display on phone isn't a particularly material financial event for us."

And to the degree to which we can get everyone to be bidding up for the traffic we have, we'll see that increased spend. I think Expedia, like our other clients, are very smart on the traffic acquisition side. So we remain, to the best of our knowledge, an incredibly important, valuable partner of theirs in terms of buying direct leads. Their sales and marketing line, I believe, encompasses quite a bit more than just the direct marketing.

I think we more hear, ""Wow, it's a lot of information. It's a lot to digest."" And to put it into perspective, if we have a client that's bidding on 100,000 properties times call it 20 different markets, that's just a lot of data to digest and make sense of. So we're having to be measured in our rollout per our client request basically. So I don't -- it's a little hard for me to imagine a situation where over time, we don't have this information available to everyone. But I'm a lot more cautious about trying to predict in which quarter it will be both available and consumed for everyone. To your second part of your question, lifetime value of the reviews, we heartily agree that the 6-year-old review is perhaps nice to have on the site because it mentioned something that's unique to that review: a tip in the neighborhood or something like that, climbed on top of the hill to watch beautiful sunsets. The 6-year-old review really isn't part of our popularity index calculation anymore either because it's so old and so much can change in the 6 years. Similarly, we have some hotels north of 8,000 reviews. And they may be all current, but you still don't need 8,000 to have a lot of liquidity of opinion for that property. The beauty of what we're able to do with generating so many more reviews is sort of provide fantastic coverage on not only the top properties in the city but kind of all the properties in the city in the country, all the restaurants. So it's getting to the point where it's tough to find a hotel with less than 50 reviews. And that's what we're getting pretty excited about because everyone can look at 5 reviews on a property and say, ""What's the big deal?"" With 50, you start to really understand what you're going to get when you stay there. And the same applies restaurant and the same applies to tours and attractions and museums and kind of everything else that goes into what folks are looking at. So sure, if you took the 6-year-old reviews off the site, no one would notice. The volume was so small anyways. It practically doesn't matter. We keep them on there just as a convenient function for our current customers."

So Facebook remains a meaningful channel to grow our brand awareness and to grow our membership. I'll try to be reasonably clear that we don't view it as a very large traffic acquisition channel, certainly not compared to a channel like Search. So you have folks on Facebook that are engaged in sharing and learning about what their friends are into, posting photos and the rest. And at many times, they're interested in interacting with our brand, with our Cities I've Visited or seeing a status update from their friends about the trips that they've taken. The Cities I've Visited app, to use it, you're joining TripAdvisor, and you're telling us something about yourself, namely all the different places that you've been. You're also giving us your friend network so that we can share all those places that you've been as data when your friends come and browse on TripAdvisor. To recap, Facebook as a member acquisition channel is quite strong for us because we spend a certain amount to advertise our map and TripAdvisor applications, we get a certain uptake but at a somewhat expensive rate. That's sort of qualitative because it's just a member, it's not a travel booking yet. But because of what those folks are doing with the app, it's generating invitations to other users, it's generating status feeds, it's generating open graph [ph] items and I can go through the long do list of Facebook viral channels, which in turn are generating lot more members for us for free. We're not having to pay to acquire. So we continue our spend on that channel because it helps us grow our membership and it helps us grow our social content, namely knowing where your friends had been to in order to make progress on our social and personalization efforts, which I've touched upon. So think of it as building a huge database of travelers, travelers who happen to be Facebook connected. We're learning more and more about them whether or not they've been to TripAdvisor yet or teaching them about TripAdvisor, and we're getting the click-through rates and the emails that say, ""Hey, they're interested in this. So they're coming back."" And then the longer-term question is and through that mechanism, will they be converted to the more domain-direct, the more branded association. We see positive signs, but the jury is still out by several quarters, in our opinion, as to whether that's going to move the needle as much as we hope going forward."

So on the Expedia agency business, we're certainly aware of their offering choice to their consumers. We don't have inside information, but it stands to reason one of the opportunities for them is to increase their conversion rate even if the margin or the finances behind it might be different. And I say might because again, I'm not part of it. Our respective interests are perfectly aligned because if offering the pay at checkout feature improves conversion, then they're making more money per -- not necessarily per booking but per lead I send them because of the higher conversion rate. Therefore, they can afford to pay me as much as they were before or even more if they dip into some of their efficiency numbers. So we don't view the percentage uptake of their agency business as bad in any way should it be strong in certain markets. If it helps -- another way to look at it is if it helps them be competitive in certain markets, where they didn't have the product offering before, fantastic because then they'll be able to bid more for traffic in those markets. Again, the conversion rate is expected to make up for any loss in merchant revenues. It's actually a little bit related to the OTA conversion, the second part of your question. So when we look at the leads that we send to our clients, I don't really ask them, ""Are my leads better converting than a Google or somebody else?"" I look to see on a per-dollar spend basis, ""Do we generate more profit for you folks than your other channels?"" And we continue to hear that our clients are bidding independently, i.e., they're not favoring TripAdvisor over Google or vice versa. They'll spend wherever they get the next best ROI. So if a TripAdvisor lead converts at twice the rate of a Google lead, then they're probably paying twice as much for it. Then the converse is true, too. Well, comparing the actual CPC or the actual conversion independently, not really the question you want to ask is the ""Hey, how's the efficiency of TripAdvisor as a traffic source to these clients?"" And while every one of our clients, no doubt, would like an even more efficient source, they're all free to lower the bids at any point, which will get them less traffic but presumably a little bit more efficient. And they're not doing that. So they've -- it's always changing, but it seems like they've found a happy balance in terms of the efficiency that they're willing to spend on TripAdvisor and the conversion that, that drives."

I'm happy to report that TripAdvisor had a strong third quarter. We generated record quarterly revenue of $212.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $107.1 million. Across the globe, traffic to our site continues to be strong, as total traffic to TripAdvisor sites grew in the mid-30s and, even more importantly, our hotel shoppers have continued to grow at approximately 30% based on our log files.
I'm also pleased that we made great progress this quarter rapidly innovating the TripAdvisor experience for both our users and our advertising partners alike. 
Our core click-based revenue accelerated, growing 15% year-over-year based on continued strong hotel shopper growth. This revenue growth can also be attributed to improvements in our on-site conversion and personalization efforts, offset by a still weak, yet stabilizing, Southern European market. Unique to the third quarter, we estimate that the Summer Olympics had a 2% negative impact on hotel shopper traffic in click-based revenue.
We were also pleased to see a 5% to 6% uplift in click-based revenue very late in the quarter, when we lapped last year's site redesign. We expect this uplift to continue in the coming quarters.
One of the most exciting things to see is the continued strong growth and deep engagement of our growing traveler community. Our marketable members grew over 70% year-over-year to more than 36 million, fueling our robust and growing email campaigns. Our members love sharing their travel experiences with other travelers and friends, and they continue to share content in 21 different languages at a remarkable rate of more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year. 
During the third quarter, we were thrilled to announce content syndication agreements with Best Western and with Wyndham Hotels Group. The Wyndham partnership, which has been expanded to 15 of their hotel brands, also includes a review collection agreement, where Wyndham will encourage their guests to share their experiences through a post-stay email and survey powered by TripAdvisor. Including these latest wins, we now syndicate our traveler reviews to more than 500 major travel partners, including more than 50 hotel chains, reinforcing and enhancing the visibility of the TripAdvisor brand as the de facto standard for travel research.
We also appreciate that tens of thousands of individual business owners around the world proudly display their ""Reviewed on TripAdvisor"" stickers, their certificates of excellence and their Travelers' Choice plaques on-site at their hotels, restaurants and attractions. The brand flywheel is humming, but with TripAdvisor sites accounting for only 10% of online travel uniques, we have a lot of runway left for continued growth and adoption.
At TripAdvisor, we are always innovating our products and extensively testing and discovering new ways to improve site usability and experience for our users. We strive to create the very best experience for every user, on every device, in every geography. You can see this in our social and personalization initiatives, great vehicles through which we learn about our users, their friends and their preferences, all of which enable us to deliver more satisfying, inspiring and customized travel planning experience for everyone.
Along these lines, we continue to leverage the Facebook platform and, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to welcome aboard via acquisition the talented team from Wanderfly, whose focus on blending inspiration, personalization and social, nicely complement our ongoing efforts.
In addition to social and personalization, mobile is a key area of focus and investment as we innovate to deliver the best user experience on every device. Year-over-year, we've seen downloads of our smartphone and tablet apps more than double, reaching more than 26 million total downloads. Over the same timeframe, our average monthly mobile uniques are up over 130%, more than 35 million, according to our own log files. 
We rolled out an improved tablet interface during the quarter and have seen tablet monetization improve nicely since the -- since earlier this year. It's now more closely resembling desktop, an important trend given that tablet comprises about 3/4 of our mobile revenue. 
On the other hand, smartphone monetization isn't growing as quickly as tablet monetization, which is not surprising to us given the use case and form factor of that device. 
During Q3, we began testing hotel meta display on smartphones, an exciting step towards optimizing the user experience. Similar to our Flights product, user interface shows partner prices and availability in line, allowing a hotel shopper to more easily compare booking options. The tests are progressing well, and barring any unforeseen challenges, we expect to roll out hotel meta display to all phone traffic later this quarter.
For us, the phone is all about optimizing the user experience. And we expect over time, this innovation will drive better user engagement, better conversion and therefore, better monetization on the phone's smaller real estate.
Now the logical question to ask is, are we planning to roll out a meta display to all users on all platforms in all geographies. And the answer is we don't know yet. We think the meta experience on phone makes a lot of sense and is worth testing on desktop, but we aren't making any commitments beyond testing at this point. 
We've contemplated a meta display for years. And as with all of our product releases, there are 3 main things that we consider: Is it good for the user experience? Is it good for our clients? And what does it do for TripAdvisor economics? We always weigh these factors very carefully, and our objective is to find the solution that works best for all 3.
As it relates to our OTA and hotelier partners, looking at the global landscape, we have seen improvements throughout Q3, especially in our newer international markets. 
In the EMEA, we added Geremia hotels to our growing list of partners in the Middle East. In APAC, we added 3 new regional Asian OTAs, including asiarooms. On the bidding side, we started testing property rank reporting with a select set of major OTA clients in 3 test markets in early October. And while that testing has begun, we have not been surprised by any of the results so far. The goal of providing these reports is to allow partners the chance to better understand their ROI on TripAdvisor, and help them rationalize higher per-unit or per-click spend. We expect the test to be successful and expect to have minimum CPC per property thresholds in place in early 2013. At that point, we would consider moving to a worldwide rollout.
During our relatively short history as a public company, you've heard us describe a few initiatives we've undertaken to strategically position TripAdvisor for the long term. From our site redesign to our traffic quality improvement measures, the data sharing with large partners and our new meta interface on smartphones, we remain focused on optimizing user experience, enhancing client satisfaction and maximizing TripAdvisor economics over the long term. This has been TripAdvisor's DNA since inception.
In summary, we had a great quarter. We're squarely on track to deliver, to achieve, our 2012 business objectives and are excited about how we position the business for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q3 results and our financial outlook."

Assuming constant currency, revenue would have been 4% higher. 
Click-based revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $168 million. When comparing year-over-year hotel shopper growth, approximately 30%, to click-based revenue growth, please note that revenue growth this past quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 5% from foreign exchange, 5% to 6% from last year's site redesign and 3% to 5% from the spin-related Expedia pricing changes. Additionally, as Steve mentioned, we believe that our hotel shopper traffic and revenue would have been 2% higher were it not for the lower traffic during the Summer Olympics.
Display-based advertising revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $23.6 million, driven by solid growth in the Americas, offset by weakness in EMEA due to persistent macroeconomic softness in Southern Europe. Assuming constant currency, display-based revenue would have been 2% higher.
Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes business listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a solid Q3, growing 53% to $21.1 million. In business listings, new sales reps are ramping globally, and we expect to see continued productivity improvements as we enter 2013.
As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 50% of total revenue during the third quarter, compared to 49% in Q2 and 47% in the third quarter of 2011.
In general, we saw click growth accelerate in our core markets. And on the pricing side, we saw stabilizing to improving pricing abroad. Specifically in EMEA, we saw accelerating growth in the U.K. despite a persistently tough pricing environment. Also, Southern Europe, although still weak, showed encouraging signs of pricing stabilization. Our newer Russian market remains in hyper-growth mode, albeit growing off a smaller base. In our fast-growing Latin America and APAC markets, we saw continued strong hotel shopper growth and solid pricing trends, driven by stronger coverage, traffic acquisition, brand building and content collection initiatives. Notably, Brazil remains in a hyper-growth mode as well. And to put it into perspective, it's fast approaching Spain and Italy in terms of click-based revenue.
On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.5 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter, consistent sequentially on a percentage of revenue basis. Given that Q4 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to see deleveraging in our non-GAAP sales and marketing spend. This translates into sales and marketing spend in the high-30s to low-40s as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter and mid-30s as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Moving forward, we continue to prioritize traffic diversification, international expansion and a hotel shopper growth as we identify underleveraged marketing channels to meet these growth objectives.
Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $20.3 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, and non-GAAP G&A expenses were $16 million or 8% of revenue. Both were in line with our expectations, and we expect these expense lines to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis in Q4.
Our Q3 effective tax rate of 34.4% was higher than we expected due to an income mix shift towards jurisdictions with higher statutory rates, as well as an increase in valuation allowance for one of our U.S. subsidiaries. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively consistent with our year-to-date rate.
Cash flow from operations was strong at $76.5 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes, or low-30s as a percentage of revenue. In terms of headcount, we ended Q3 with 1,483 employees, up from 1,444 employees at June 30 and 1,196 at the end of Q3 2011.
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Given our year-to-date performance, we continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. Driven mainly by continued strong hotel shopper growth and the tailwinds created from lapping last year's site redesign, we now expect click-based revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year. 
While fourth quarter-to-date volume and conversion remain strong, pricing continues to be a headwind given the persistent macroeconomic softness overseas, as well as the fact that we are still comping higher pre-spin Expedia pricing. We continue to expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display-based revenue, as it faces a tough Q4 comp based on unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. We also expect full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth to be consistent with our year-to-date results.
Based on our continued profitability outperformance, we now expect full year 2012 adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single digits. 
We are in the midst of our 2013 planning process and will provide our expectations for next year on our Q4 call.
In closing, our year-to-date performance keeps us well on track to achieve our 2012 goals. We will now open the call up to your questions."

And it's kind of what I had told you we expected to see over time as the tablet usage much more closely resembles desktop. On the phone, we haven't seen a meaningful change in the monetization rate, i.e., it's still a very small percentage of desktop. And we think it's form factor. We think it's in market activity. We think it's folks who are thinking about the trip, checking out some hotels and some whatever, who just aren't ready to actually spend the money right then and there because our typical usage pattern is not, ""Last minute, landed in the city, need a hotel room,"" that some other apps may have. So we've introduced, from a testing perspective, meta display to the smartphones because we think that's just a much better experience when someone wants to check the prices and do that base level of research. Because we're showing the prices in line, we think the conversion rate of the leads will be higher downstream. So the overall monetization rate of that display will be better for us. And I'm just cautioning that in that mobile environment, a, it's a small part of our traffic; b, it's a poorly monetizing, small part of our traffic.

We've seen some cases where partners have lifted their bids. Is it seasonal? Is it more hungry for reach? Or is it they can afford more because our traffic is better? So I don't, unfortunately, have a whole lot to offer by way of direct feedback. In terms of the bid piece, we haven't really changed anything in terms of how partners can bid on our traffic. What we've really done -- started to do in these tests markets is provide more transparency about what their bid currently gets them in terms of the rank reporting. And as I said, we -- some partners have started to use that information. There hasn't been any meaningful changes that we've been able to detect, either up or down, with respect to that having a material impact on us. We can say that the partners that have some of this information are grateful for it. They appreciate us giving it to them, and it's working their way through their systems as to how they might be able to take advantage of it."

And now that we are a stand-alone company and have our own tax department and are looking at where our IP is located and what makes the best business sense, we're definitely looking into that. One thing that also plays into TripAdvisor's negative impact on the rates is that we're headquartered in Massachusetts, which has a higher tax rate than where some of the other players may be located. So we're working on it, I'd love a lower tax rate, and it is definitely part of our strategy going forward. Regarding the EBITDA margins, I want to remind you that we did not give that. That 42% to 47% was not guidance and, or a long-term target model. It was just to illustrate the effect of the spin on our 2010 numbers. So we've had things like the additional G&A costs, the decrease in Expedia pricing. Those -- that impact was applied against 2010 just to give an illustrative model. We're in the process of -- we've had a lot of movements in 2013 -- excuse me, in 2012.

We've gone through the step function. We've brought things down to what we believe are much closer to kind of market rates. And now it's a bidding environment. And to the degree to which we can get everyone to be bidding up for the traffic we have, we'll see that increased spend. I think Expedia, like our other clients, are very smart on the traffic acquisition side. So we remain, to the best of our knowledge, an incredibly important, valuable partner of theirs in terms of buying direct leads. Their sales and marketing line, I believe, encompasses quite a bit more than just the direct marketing. So in that -- in their marketing spend, it could well be in other areas that we don't participate in: TV, radio, whatever it might be. You'd have to ask them about that part."

So that's 2% on overall -- on CPC tax-linked revenue. And when you extrapolate that out, it's probably about 1.5% off of our total year-over-year growth rate. The site redesign is probably the largest one. We -- as Steve mentioned, we lapped that at the end of Q3. At that time, we were able to clearly see that it had negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by about 5% to 6%. So like we would expect that trend to continue forward into Q4 and beyond. And then the other mention that we made was the Expedia pricing. Now that contract anniversaries the date of the spin.

I think we more hear, ""Wow, it's a lot of information. It's a lot to digest."" And to put it in perspective, if we have a client that's bidding on 100,000 properties times, call it, 20 different markets, that's just a lot of data to digest and make sense of. So we're having to be measured in our rollout per our client request, basically. So I don't -- it's a little hard for me to imagine a situation where over time, we don't have this information available to everyone. But I'm a lot more cautious about trying to predict in which quarter it will be both available and consumed for everyone. To your second part of your question, lifetime value of the reviews, we heartily agree that the 6-year-old review is perhaps nice to have on the site because it mentions something that's unique to that review, a tip in the neighborhood or something like that, climbed on top of the hill to watch a beautiful sunset. The 6-year-old review really isn't part of our popularity index calculation anymore either, because it's so old and so much can change in the 6 years. Similarly, we have some hotels north of 8,000 reviews. And they may be all current, but you still don't need 8,000 to have a lot of liquidity of opinion for that property. The beauty of what we're able to do with generating so many more reviews is sort of provide fantastic coverage on not only the top properties in the city, but kind of all the properties in the city, in the country, all the restaurants. So it's getting to the point where it's tough to find a hotel with less than 50 reviews. And that's what we're getting pretty excited about because everyone can look at 5 reviews on a property and say, ""What's the big deal?"" With 50, you start to really understand what you're going to get when you stay there. And the same applies to restaurants and the same applies to tours and attractions and museums and kind of everything else that goes into what folks are looking at. So sure, if you took the 6-year-old reviews off the site, no one would notice. The volume was so small anyways, it practically doesn't matter. We keep them on there just as a convenience function for our current customers."

I still kind of stand by my original comments in terms of the use case of the mobile phone. While some other apps or the OTA apps, if you find yourself in a city and you need a hotel room and you haven't done any advance planning, you're just probably more in the, ""Hey, find me something close to where I am and I'm going to book it,"" and an OTA web app can -- an OTA app can do that for you quite well.

So Facebook remains a meaningful channel to grow our brand awareness and to grow our membership. I've tried to be reasonably clear that we don't view it as a very large traffic acquisition channel, certainly not compared to a channel like search. So you have folks on Facebook that are engaged in sharing and learning about what their friends are into, posting photos and the rest. And at many times, they're interested in interacting with our brand, with our Cities I've Visited or seeing a status update from their friends about the trips that they've taken. The Cities I've Visited app, to use it, you're joining TripAdvisor, and you're telling us something about yourself, namely all the different places that you've been. You're also giving us your friend network so that we can share all those places that you've been as data when your friends come and browse on TripAdvisor. To recap, Facebook as a member acquisition channel is quite strong for us because we spend a certain amount to advertise our map and TripAdvisor applications, we get a certain uptake, that's at a somewhat expensive rate. That's sort of qualitative because it's just a member, it's not a travel booking yet. But because of what those folks are doing with the app, it's generating invitations to other users, it's generating status feeds, it's generating Open Graph items and I can go through the laundry list of Facebook viral channels, which in turn are generating a lot more members for us for free. We're not having to pay to acquire. So we continue our spend on that channel because it helps us grow our membership and it helps us grow our social content, namely knowing where your friends have been to in order to make progress on our social and personalization efforts, which I've touched upon. So think of it as building a huge database of travelers, travelers who happen to be Facebook connected. We're learning more and more about them, whether or not they've been to TripAdvisor yet, we're teaching them about TripAdvisor, and we're getting the click-through rates and the emails that say, ""Hey, they're interested in this. So they're coming back."" And then the longer-term question is and through that mechanism, will they be converted to the more domain-direct, the more branded association. We see positive signs, but the jury is still out by several quarters, in our opinion, as to whether that's going to move the needle as much as we hope going forward."

So on the Expedia agency business, we're certainly aware of their offering choice to their consumers. We don't have inside information, but it stands to reason one of the opportunities for them is to increase their conversion rate even if the margin or the finances behind it might be different. And I say might because again, I'm not part of it. Our respective interests are perfectly aligned because if offering the pay at checkout feature improves conversion, then they're making more money per -- not necessarily per booking but per lead I send them because of the higher conversion rate. Therefore, they can afford to pay me as much as they were before or even more if they dip into some of their efficiency numbers. So we don't view the percentage uptake of their agency business as bad in any way should it be strong in certain markets. If it helps -- another way to look at it is if it helps them be competitive in certain markets, where they didn't have the product offering before, fantastic, because then they'll be able to bid more for traffic in those markets. Again, the conversion rate is expected to make up for any loss in merchant revenues. It's actually a little bit related to the OTA conversion, the second part of your question. So when we look at the leads that we send to our clients, I don't really ask them, ""Are my leads better converting than a Google or somebody else?"" I look to see, on a per-dollar spend basis, ""Do we generate more profit for you folks than your other channels?"" And we continue to hear that our clients are bidding independently, i.e., they're not favoring TripAdvisor over Google or vice versa. They'll spend wherever they get the next best ROI. So if a TripAdvisor lead converts at twice the rate of a Google lead, then they're probably paying twice as much for it. Then the converse is true, too. Will comparing the actual CPC or the actual conversion independently, not really the question you want to ask, it's the ""Hey, how's the efficiency of TripAdvisor as a traffic source to these clients?"" And while every one of our clients, no doubt, would like an even more efficient source, they're all free to lower their bids at any point, which will get them less traffic but presumably a little bit more efficient. And they're not doing that. So they've -- it's always changing, but it seems like they've found a happy balance in terms of the efficiency that they're willing to spend on TripAdvisor and the conversion that, that drives."
