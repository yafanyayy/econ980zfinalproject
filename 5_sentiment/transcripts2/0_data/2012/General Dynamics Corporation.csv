Charges taken by Jet Aviation's Completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. F",3551,"General Dynamics fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our Defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's Completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our Defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries.
Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations.
Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, 1 related to contract losses, and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrowbody widebody aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work. The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 widebody narrowbody aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at jet aviation.  Once we've delivered these aircraft, our jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new revenue management and operating processes.
As a result of trends experienced in the Completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at jet aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet in narrowbody widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter. These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record.  The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's Completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount, improving the coordination between engineering and operations and strengthening supply-chain management controls.  I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012-- 2011, excuse me, and remain well-positioned within established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. 
I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth. 
Now let me talk about the Aerospace group, and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity in the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010, and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year. 
Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service into that midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confident in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.
Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remain robust and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. Preowned inventory levels for both large and mid-cabin aircraft continue to show gradual improvement. We took 1 aircraft and trade in the fourth quarter and subsequently sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft.
The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large cabin offerings. Similarly, international customers continue to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year comprising nearly 45% of the order book.  Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011  since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.
New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional-type certification. We actually sell fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.  I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18 to 24 month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft.
At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continue to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere. 
In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia Pacific-based customers.  Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2/3.
In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect midsize green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280.  The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation. 
Next, the Defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our Defense segments, let me comment briefly on our Defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process. General Dynamics programs were well-supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs.
However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we sign 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put in a position where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely. This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled.  If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved. The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall in our programs in particular will fair. 
Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress. Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 Defense segment guidance is realistic.  We are doing everything in our control to position our Defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions. These types of actions enabled us to maintain Defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster growing market channels.
We continue to feel confident about the Defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base which must be maintained. We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy for structures and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.
Now, let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position Combat Systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally. 
In the fourth quarter, Combat System sales were $2.6 billion while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing as several new engineering and development opportunities plan for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period.
For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline. Cost-reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.
Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers, and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year end total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.
While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker double-V hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.
The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, the amphibious combat vehicle and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer.
Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's depo over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors. Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customer identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.
Our International Vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. Vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East.
Ammunitions and Weapons Systems businesses, also faced budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the Axle business should provide some offset. 
For 2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. Expect operating margins in the low to mid 14% range consistent with 2011.
Next, Marine Systems, the Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010. 
Higher Ohio class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earning and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. The sales decline was primarily a timing issue as several Destroyer awards plan for earlier in the year slipped in the third quarter.  The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improve performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.
Marine's year end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog include several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class Destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002, 2 DDG 51 Destroyers, part of the Eave's early bird restart program, 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships, and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition. In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013.
For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines, the SSBN replacement program, additional DDG 51s, a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers and new commercial work. The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders.
Moving to IS&T, IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset the decline the group's Tactical Communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011. 
Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations, FCS modernization, I-WIN integrated wireless network, and JTRS AMF just to name 3, and award delays, particularly in shorter cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-source technical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment II and CHS IV were delayed by approximately 6 months.
Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011 as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.
Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in the year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010.
This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than never, as our products and services portfolio remains well-aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cybersecurity, enhance ISR, battlefield communications and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. 
IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards effectively pushing sales to the right, even more than what we saw in 2011.  Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT Services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment.
The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011 and I expect that to persist this year. Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase $20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our Combat, Marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well-positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia-Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence-mission support capabilities remain well-aligned with customer requirements. Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customer as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war. Outside of Defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase.  Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million. 
Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011 and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter, was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we expected it. That of course was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based Completions business. 
For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension at the R&D tax credit and the provisions of the tax code. 
Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million occurring primarily in the second half of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks."

But everything we see in the production side, everything we see in Savannah is coming along very handsomely with the 650.

But when we put the new management team in place just after the midyear, when Dan Claire and his team settle in, we brought in some other subject matter experts from across the businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with the sightline to get clarity and definition, if you will, more granularity on what we were feeling and seeing, they did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter, where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realize the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment, we view the long-live assets, so you have it, 78 of 1, $111 million for the other, and I also mentioned in my remarks, that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular, and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- 1 of them within a matter of a couple few weeks, and the others by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers. We're very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. What I would also say that the charges that were taken, capture the costs that we have incurred thus far and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place, the management team is firmly in control, the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well-defined, clarified and we're running smoothly with a workforce that is pulling together in the ways that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves in 2012 in a place of much better improvement at jet completions and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year."

We risk-adjust everything we do based on the type of business it is. So I feel like we've got the rigor we need to fairly assess what's out there and make good judgments on whether it makes sense to acquire or not. But having said all of that, I'll go back to where I was a minute ago, that I believe there will be acquisition opportunities going forward in the defense space, if where nothing else, just as a result of the tightening of the defense market."

Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year.",3557,"General Dynamics fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. 
Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries.
Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with combat systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. 
Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations.
Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body, wide-body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work. 
The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation.  Once we've delivered these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new management and operating processes.
As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at Jet Aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet in narrow-body, widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter. 
These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record.  The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount, improving the coordination between engineering and operations and strengthening supply chain management controls.  
I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012-- 2011, excuse me, and remain well positioned with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth. 
Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity in the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. 
Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010 and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year. 
Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.
Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remain robust, and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. 
Preowned inventory levels for both large and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter and subsequently, sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft.
The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large cabin offerings. 
Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year, comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011  since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.
New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.  I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft.
At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continue to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere. 
In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia-Pacific-based customers.  Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2/3.
In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect mid-sized green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280.  The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation. 
Next, the defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our defense segments, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process. 
General Dynamics programs were well supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs.
However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put in a position where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely. 
This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled.  If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved. 
The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall in our programs in particular will fair. 
Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress. 
Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 defense segment guidance is realistic.  We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions. 
These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster growing market channels.
We continue to feel confident about the defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. 
We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy fore structures, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.
Now let's move to combat systems. The combat systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands combat systems' sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. 
As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar-variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position combat systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally. 
In the fourth quarter, combat systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities plan for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period.
For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline. 
Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled combat systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.
Combat systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  
The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year-end total potential contract value for combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.
While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker Double-V Hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.
The combat systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; the amphibious combat vehicle; and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer.
Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston depot over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors. 
Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customer identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.
Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East.
Ammunitions and weapons systems businesses also faced budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the axle business should provide some offset. 
For 2012, I expect combat systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. We expect operating margins in the low to mid 14% range, consistent with 2011.
Next, marine systems. The marine systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010. 
Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth, while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. 
The sales decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third quarter. The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improve performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.
Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog include several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class destroyers, DDG's 1001 and 1002, 2 DDG 51 destroyers, part of the EFV's Arleigh Burke restart program, 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition. 
In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines, which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013.
For the year ahead, I expect marine systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines, the SSBN replacement program, additional DDG 51s, a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers and new commercial work. 
The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders.
Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset a decline at the group's tactical communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011. 
Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations FCS brigade modernization; IWIN, integrated wireless network; and JTRS AMF, just to name 3, and award delays, particularly in shorter-cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-sourced tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment 2 and CHS-4were delayed by approximately 6 months.
Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.
Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010.
This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than never, as our products and services portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security, enhanced ISR, battlefield communications and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. 
IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards effectively pushing sales to the right, even more than what we saw in 2011.  Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT Services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment.
The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011, and I expect that to persist this year. 
Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our combat, marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence-mission support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements. 
Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customer as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war. 
Outside of defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase.  Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

I'd like to cover a few additional financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with o",244,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I'd like to cover a few additional financial items before the question-and-answer period. 
First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million. 
Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter, was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we expected it. 
That, of course, was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension at the R&D tax credit and the provisions of the tax code. 
Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million occurring primarily in the second half of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks."

So this is a constant work in progress between us, the customer and the Congress, and I would anticipate that to continue. So there will be some U.S. vehicle decline. We see that quite clearly. But don't forget, those programs are both elemental to the United States Army, even as they reshape themselves. So we'll use the international sales to help offset that, but we'll still do a great deal of business in both those domestic programs, and now we've got Force Protection in there to help us on both the product and sustainment piece for the vehicle business."

They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter, where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment, review the long-lived assets. And so you have it, $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my remarks, that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular, and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- one of them within a matter of a couple of few weeks and the others -- by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers. We have very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have incurred, thus far, and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place, the management team is firmly in control, the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified.

Welcome back, and good morning.General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion busines",3561,"Thank you, Amy. Welcome back, and good morning.
General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. 
Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries.
Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. 
Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations.
Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body, wide-body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work. 
The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation.  Once we've delivered these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new management and operating processes.
As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at Jet Aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet and narrow-body, widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter. 
These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record.  The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount; improving the coordination between engineering and operations; and strengthening supply chain management controls.  
I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012 -- 2011, excuse me, and remain well positioned with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth. 
Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity and the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. 
Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010 and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year. 
Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter, to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.
Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust, and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. 
Preowned inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter, and subsequently sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft.
The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large-cabin offerings. 
Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year, comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011  since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.
New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.  I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft.
At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continued to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere. 
In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia Pacific-based customers.  Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2/3.
In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large-cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect mid-sized green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280.  The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation. 
Next, the defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our defense segments, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process. 
General Dynamics programs were well supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs.
However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put into positions where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely.  This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled.  If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved. 
The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall, and our programs in particular, will fare. 
Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress. 
Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 defense segment guidance is realistic.  We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions. 
These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster-growing market channels.
We continue to feel confident about the defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. 
We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy Force Structures, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.
Now let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems' sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. 
As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar-variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position combat systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally. 
In the fourth quarter, Combat Systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities planned for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period.
For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in Axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline. 
Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.
Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment; and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers, and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  
The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year-end total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.
While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker Double-V Hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.
The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; the amphibious combat vehicle; and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer.
Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston depot over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors. 
Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customers identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.
Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East.
Our munitions and weapons systems businesses also face budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the Axle business should provide some offset. 
For 2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. We expect operating margins in the low- to mid-14% range, consistent with 2011.
Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010. 
Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth, while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. 
The sales decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third quarter. The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improved performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.
Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog includes several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class destroyers; DDGs 1001 and 1002; 2 DDG 51 destroyers, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program; 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships; and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition. 
In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines, which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013.
For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low- to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines; the SSBN replacement program; additional DDG 51s; a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers; and new commercial work. 
The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders.
Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business, bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset a decline at the group's tactical communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011. 
Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations: FCS brigade modernization; IWIN integrated wireless network; and JTRS AMF, just to name 3; and award delays, particularly in shorter-cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-source tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment 2 and CHS-4, were delayed by approximately 6 months.
Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.
Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010.
This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low-rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full-rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever, as our products and services portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security; enhanced ISR; battlefield communications; and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. 
IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards, effectively pushing sales to the right even more than what we saw in 2011.  Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment.
The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011, and I expect that to persist this year. 
Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our Combat, Marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence mission-support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements. 
Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customers as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war. 
Outside of defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase.  Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million. 
Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we had expected. 
That, of course, was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit in the provisions of the tax code. 
Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million, occurring primarily in the second half of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks."

But when we put the new management team in place, okay, just after the midyear and Dan Claire and his team settled in, we brought in some other subject-matter experts from across the businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with the sightline to get clarity and definition, if you will -- more granularity on what we were feeling and seeing. They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment review of the long-lived assets. And so you have it, $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my remarks that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft, and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular; and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- one of them within a matter of a couple of, few weeks and the others -- by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers, with very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have incurred thus far, and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place; the management team is firmly in control; the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified. And we're running smoothly with a workforce that is pulling together in the ways that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves in 2012 in a place of much better improvement at Jet completions, and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year."

I believe, based on that, some of the software issues we'd talked about before in terms of what you need to get final certification, type certification, I would expect that to be second quarter -- midyear, as I said, entry into service. But as far as the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself is performing very well. And there is great customer interest. So I think that captures most of the 280. Let me think. Yes, that's probably enough on the 280. But we're on track for certain delivery by the midyear. The dollar forfeiture, the forfeitures, the LD is really a function of getting liquidated damages from the defaults that we experienced, which were higher than they would normally be. We knew that would probably be the case. It was the case, yet it was less than we expected, which sounds like I'm talking around a circle. But at any rate, we got substantially fewer than that in the forecast for 2012. And I think that's probably enough to say right there."

Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year.",3553,"General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. 
Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries.
Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. 
Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations.
Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body, wide-body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work. 
The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation.  Once we've delivered these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new management and operating processes.
As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at Jet Aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet and narrow-body, widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter. 
These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record.  The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount; improving the coordination between engineering and operations; and strengthening supply chain management controls.  
I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012 -- 2011, excuse me, and remain well positioned with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth. 
Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity and the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. 
Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010 and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year. 
Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter, to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.
Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust, and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. 
Preowned inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter, and subsequently sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft.
The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large-cabin offerings. 
Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year, comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011  since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.
New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.  I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft.
At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continued to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere. 
In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia Pacific-based customers.  Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2/3.
In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large-cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect mid-sized green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280.  The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation. 
Next, the defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our defense segments, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process. 
General Dynamics programs were well supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs.
However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put into positions where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely.  This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled.  If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved. 
The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall, and our programs in particular, will fare. 
Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress. 
Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 defense segment guidance is realistic.  We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions. 
These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster-growing market channels.
We continue to feel confident about the defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. 
We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy Force Structures, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.
Now let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems' sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. 
As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar-variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position combat systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally. 
In the fourth quarter, Combat Systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities planned for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period.
For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in Axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline. 
Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.
Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment; and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers, and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  
The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year-end total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.
While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker Double-V Hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.
The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; the amphibious combat vehicle; and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer.
Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston depot over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors. 
Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customers identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.
Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East.
Our munitions and weapons systems businesses also face budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the Axle business should provide some offset. 
For 2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. We expect operating margins in the low- to mid-14% range, consistent with 2011.
Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010. 
Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth, while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. 
The sales decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third quarter. The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improved performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.
Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog includes several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class destroyers; DDGs 1001 and 1002; 2 DDG 51 destroyers, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program; 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships; and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition. 
In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines, which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013.
For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low- to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines; the SSBN replacement program; additional DDG 51s; a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers; and new commercial work. 
The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders.
Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business, bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset a decline at the group's tactical communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011. 
Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations: FCS brigade modernization; IWIN integrated wireless network; and JTRS AMF, just to name 3; and award delays, particularly in shorter-cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-source tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment 2 and CHS-4, were delayed by approximately 6 months.
Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.
Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010.
This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low-rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full-rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever, as our products and services portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security; enhanced ISR; battlefield communications; and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. 
IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards, effectively pushing sales to the right even more than what we saw in 2011.  Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment.
The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011, and I expect that to persist this year. 
Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our Combat, Marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence mission-support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements. 
Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customers as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war. 
Outside of defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase.  Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million. 
Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we had expected. 
That, of course, was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit in the provisions of the tax code. 
Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million, occurring primarily in the second half of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks."

The aircraft is performing beautifully, and the sales book is still very active, even with over 200 in the backlog. So that's all good. We are on track, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I think the way I said -- the words I used were ""in the midyear."" We're still looking at about late second quarter, thereabouts. It's paced, quite honestly, by the working down of the test points in collaboration and with the FAA. All on track. All looking real strong right now. The airplanes, as I said, are performing beautifully. The margins were consistent with what I've been saying, Joe. They are better than the group average but not as strong, as you would expect, as the in-production large-cabin aircraft. That, too, will change, as I've said before, and it will ramp up beautifully. I'm just not-- I'm not ready to wick that up verbally yet. But everything we see in the production side, everything we see in Savannah is coming along very handsomely with the 650. So the rate ramp-up that you asked about, again, I'm going to hold to what I've said before. The production, we're going to add about 2 dozen or so green deliveries a year. Did I say -- yes. 10 to 15 a year is what I'm -- 10-15 a year green deliveries. But my complete deliveries, I'm sticking with 17, 33 and 33 for right now, with every expectation that we'll exceed that. I'm just not ready to go there yet."

But when we put the new management team in place, okay, just after the midyear and Dan Claire and his team settled in, we brought in some other subject-matter experts from across the businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with the sightline to get clarity and definition, if you will -- more granularity on what we were feeling and seeing. They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment review of the long-lived assets. And so you have it, $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my remarks that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft, and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular; and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- one of them within a matter of a couple of, few weeks and the others -- by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers, with very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have incurred thus far, and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place; the management team is firmly in control; the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified. And we're running smoothly with a workforce that is pulling together in the ways that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves in 2012 in a place of much better improvement at Jet completions, and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year."

Yes, that's probably enough on the 280. But we're on track for certain delivery by the midyear. The dollar forfeiture, the forfeitures, the LD is really a function of getting liquidated damages from the defaults that we experienced, which were higher than they would normally be. We knew that would probably be the case. It was the case, yet it was less than we expected, which sounds like I'm talking around a circle.

Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.
Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications in the 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration.  These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and Federal government acquisition activities. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year, the anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear.
Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the office and management budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric speculation as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers reticent significant resources.
In the midst of this uncertainty or the far back as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.
As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and service business, risk remains. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.
And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to companywide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FTO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network.  We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million  7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend 8.5%, the 15th increase in so many years.
First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion. 
Now, I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the Defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the Detection Systems business which was completed in the second quarter of last year.
Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  
We continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating locations, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business.  These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly given the present challenges in their more difficult European whole market.
Combat Systems backlog declined from year-end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles as we continue to demilitarized a variety of ammunitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget.
Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V hull vehicles; and new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco.
In March, our general tactical vehicles delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat proven off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of double-V hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low risk offering, which aligns with the Army secretaries priorities for faster, smarter and cheaper and better solutions.
For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range.
Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs.
Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and mobile landing platform MLP auxiliary program.
The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year-end.
The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and on budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting to refresh.
We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Polar, in the quarter. 
In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed Alpha, and Bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly 1 year ahead of schedule and under contract cost.
AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete and fabrication of the third ship has just begun.  We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts.
The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP.
The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block by of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as well Block 4 between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year. 
As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for block 5 Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14. 
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down for the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year.
Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload and several major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding.
There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower than anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and a slower than anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses. 
As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployments of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger. In this passage month, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its former milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing. 
Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well-funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year.
With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion 5-year single source IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology.  Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders.
IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest complement of our IS&T portfolio.  
While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services. 
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and to point a fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April. For instance, earlier this month, we received a full year $173 million rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our Tactical Communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of the multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly.
In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted.
Now, let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand. 
The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digits improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation.
Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches in the mid-cabin market slowly improves.
Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia Pacific customers.
First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012  from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional type certification late last year. 
Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past few quarters, we still have closed the 200 in backlog. 
At quarter end, the group backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from year-end due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match plan deliveries in the near term. Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18 to 24 month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft.  The decline in Aerospace and that in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project following the death of a customer.
Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March trend. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.  We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base. For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and FlightSafety International teams to open a new flight simulator and Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and 550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.
In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly, actually almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions.
Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date for type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.
Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year.
In summary, given the environment I detailed in our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range, and as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.
As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well-positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment in our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is well-situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large cabin, full-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits.
Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some financial details. Hugh?"
274561,171238054,288301,"General Dynamics Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. Let me start there. T",422,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. 
Let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we thought have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European Land Systems Switzerland-based Vehicle business. 
Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were not properly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we determined that it was not material.
Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension at the R&D tax credit.
We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April. 
Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release.

So I think that will be the reality we deal with later in the year. But I will say that we've had a slow start as I described in IS&T but we are starting to see award activity. My guidance assumes the resumption of my terms here, what I would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that, that is still going to be the case. The Encryption business as I described will have to move here at a certain time because you just can't put that off for so long. So that was the basis of my timing statement. The communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS, are in the test at NIE next month, and we expect LRIP 2 decisions that are in the plan. We have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Riflemen radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that that's going to happen. So what am I saying? I'm saying then that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good shape just to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered.

We've got the reality of award delays. We got because of that or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we got programs that were mature and very successful concluding, and Pentagon renovation, rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs, there's a good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will in the margins of probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it can change.

So if you take my guidance down 5% as I just did, and then you look at the rest of the year as I just described to Rob, is there uncertainty out there? You bet you. But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the checks in the mail to a certain extent here until we see it, as I mentioned before, more sustained ""normal activity"" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated funds. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and I don't see frankly, I guess the comment I would make would be the competition you see. And particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you see a lot of that. That accounted for the IT Service business is probably about 1/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline and part of that decline in IT service frankly is bus lost, my term in this hypercompetitive environment which is there to your point on these."

Let me start by noting that today mark the 60th anniversary of General Dynamics' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.
Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications to 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration.  These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition activities. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year. The anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate, as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear.
Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and speculation, as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers' reticence to commit resource [ph].  
In the midst of this uncertainty or the ""fog bank,"" as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio, as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.
As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risks remain. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.
And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to company-wide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  
Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  
Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied.  Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuous -- continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FBO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network.  We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million, 7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend to 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years.
First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank-export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the detection systems business, which was completed in the second quarter of last year.
Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  
And we continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating location, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business.  These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly, given the present challenges in their more difficult European whole market.
Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles, as we continue to demilitarized a variety of ammunitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for an FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget.
Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V Hull vehicles; a new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco.
In March, our general tactical vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat-proven, off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V Hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low-risk offering, which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better solutions.
For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range.
Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume, as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs.
Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program.
The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end.
The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting to refresh.  We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller, into the quarter. 
In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed alpha, and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and under contract costs.  
AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun.  We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts.
The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP.
The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year. 
As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14. 
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down for the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year.
Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on veral major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding.
There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower-than-anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and d slower-than-anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses. 
As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. In the past 6 months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its former milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing. 
Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year.
With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, 5-year, single-source, IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest, ruggedized, commercial computing and communications technology.  Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders.
IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio.  
While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high-priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services. 
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and then point of fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April. 
For instance, earlier this month, we received a 4-year, $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our tactical communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long-lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly.
In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted.
Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand. 
The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digit improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation.
Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches and the mid-cabin market slowly improves.
Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia-Pacific customers.
First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional-type certification late last year.  Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past few quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog. 
At quarter end, the group's backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from, year-end, due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. 
Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18- to 24-month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft.  The decline in Aerospace as backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project, following the death of a customer.
Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.  We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base. 
For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teams to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and 550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.
In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly -- actually, almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions.
Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.
Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year.
In summary, given the environment I detailed and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range. And as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.
As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment confronting our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is  well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large-cabin, in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits.
Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial [indiscernible]. Hugh?"

And let me start ther",422,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. 
And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we thought and have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European-Land-Systems-based -- Switzerland-based vehicle business. 
Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that weren't properly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we've determined that it was not material.
Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension at the R&D tax credit.
We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April. 
Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release. We're revising that forecast to $70 million down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers."

My guidance assumes the resumption of my terms here, what I would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that, that is still going to be the case. The encryption business, as I described, will have to move here at a certain time, because you just can't put that off, but so long. So that was the basis of my timing statement. The communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS, are in the test at NIE next month, and we expect LRIP-II decisions that are in the plan. We have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Riflemen radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that, that's going to happen. So what am I saying? I'm saying then that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good shape just to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered.

You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding Pentagon [ph] renovation, Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs -- these are good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change, but right now, the best vision we have says, we think we can get there."

But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the check's in the mail to a certain extent here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained ""normal activity"" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated fund. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and that I don't see frankly -- I guess, the comment I would make would be the competition you see. And particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for -- the IT Service business is probably about 1/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline, and part of that decline in IT service frankly is biz lost, my term, in this hypercompetitive environment which gets to your point on these."

Let me start by noting that today mark the 60th anniversary of General Dynamics' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.
Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications to 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration.  These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition execution. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year. The anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate, as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear.
Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and speculation, as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers' reticence to commit resource.  
In the midst of this uncertainty or the ""fog bank,"" as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio, as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.
As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risks remain. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.
And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to company-wide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  
Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  
Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied.  Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuous -- continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FBO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network.  We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million, 7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend to 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years.
First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank-export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the detection systems business, which was completed in the second quarter of last year.
Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  
And we continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating location, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business.  These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly, given the present challenges in their more difficult European home market.
Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles, and to continue to demilitarized a variety of munitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for an FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget.
Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V Hull vehicles; a new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco.
In March, our general tactical vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat-proven, off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V Hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low-risk offering, which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better solutions.
For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range.
Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume, as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs.
Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program.
The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end.
The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting construction.  We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller, into the quarter. 
In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed alpha, and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and under contract costs.  
AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun.  We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts.
The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP.
The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year. 
As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14. 
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down through the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year.
Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding.
There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower-than-anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and the slower-than-anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses. 
As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. In the past 6 months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its formal milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing. 
Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year.
With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, 5-year, single-source, IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest, ruggedized, commercial computing and communications technology.  Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders.
IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio.  
While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high-priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services. 
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and then point-of-fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April. 
For instance, earlier this month, we received a 4-year, $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our tactical communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long-lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly.
In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted.
Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand. 
The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digit improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation.
Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches and the mid-cabin market slowly improves.
Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia-Pacific customers.
First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional-type certification late last year.  Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past 2 quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog. 
At quarter end, the group's backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from, year-end, due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. 
Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18- to 24-month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft.  The decline in Aerospace as backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project, following the death of a customer.
Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.  We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base. 
For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teamed to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and G550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.
In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly -- actually, almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions.
Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.
Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year.
In summary, given the environment I detailed and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range. And as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.
As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment confronting our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is  well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large-cabin, in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits.
Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial [indiscernible]. Hugh?"

And let me start ther",422,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. 
And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we've caught and have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European-Land-Systems-based -- Switzerland-based vehicle business. 
Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were improperly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we've determined that it was not material.
Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit.
We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April. 
Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release. We're revising that forecast to $70 million down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers."

I don't want to over-dramatize here and say perfect storm scenario, but in a way, you could almost make that case when you say, ""Look, we've had 2 CRs in the last year. We're likely to have another one. We've got the reality of award delays."" We got -- because of that or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding Pentagon [ph] renovation, Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs -- these are good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see it through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change, but right now, the best vision we have says, we think we can get there."

I mean, one of the reasons I took the guidance down was because of what we're seeing so far. So if you take my guidance down 5% as I just did, and then you look at the rest of the year as I just described to Rob, is there uncertainty out there? You bet you. But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the check's in the mail to a certain extent here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained ""normal activity"" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated fund. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and that I don't see frankly -- I guess, the comment I would make would be the competition you see, in particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for -- the IT Service business is probably about 1/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline, and part of that decline in IT service frankly is biz lost, my term, in this hypercompetitive environment which gets to your point on these."

Let me start by noting that today mark the 60th anniversary of General Dynamics' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.
Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications to 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration.  These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition execution. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year. The anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate, as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear.
Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and speculation, as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers' reticence to commit resource.  
In the midst of this uncertainty or the ""fog bank,"" as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio, as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.
As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risks remain. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.
And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to company-wide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  
Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  
Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied.  Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuous -- continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FBO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network.  We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million, 7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend to 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years.
First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank-export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the detection systems business, which was completed in the second quarter of last year.
Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  
And we continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating location, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business.  These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly, given the present challenges in their more difficult European home market.
Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles, and to continue to demilitarized a variety of munitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for an FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget.
Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V Hull vehicles; a new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco.
In March, our general tactical vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat-proven, off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V Hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low-risk offering, which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better solutions.
For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range.
Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume, as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs.
Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program.
The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end.
The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting construction.  We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller, into the quarter. 
In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed alpha, and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and under contract costs.  
AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun.  We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts.
The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP.
The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year. 
As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14. 
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down through the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year.
Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding.
There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower-than-anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and the slower-than-anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses. 
As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. In the past 6 months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its formal milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing. 
Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year.
With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, 5-year, single-source, IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest, ruggedized, commercial computing and communications technology.  Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders.
IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio.  
While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high-priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services. 
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and then point-of-fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April. 
For instance, earlier this month, we received a 4-year, $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our tactical communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long-lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly.
In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted.
Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand. 
The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digit improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation.
Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches and the mid-cabin market slowly improves.
Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia-Pacific customers.
First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional-type certification late last year.  Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past 2 quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog. 
At quarter end, the group's backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from, year-end, due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. 
Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18- to 24-month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft.  The decline in Aerospace as backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project, following the death of a customer.
Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.  We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base. 
For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teamed to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and G550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.
In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly -- actually, almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions.
Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.
Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year.
In summary, given the environment I detailed and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range. And as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.
As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment confronting our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is  well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large-cabin, in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits.
Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial [indiscernible]. Hugh?"

And let me start ther",422,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. 
And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we've caught and have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European-Land-Systems-based -- Switzerland-based vehicle business. 
Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were improperly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we've determined that it was not material.
Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit.
We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April. 
Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release. We're revising that forecast to $70 million down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year. 
Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers."

My guidance assumes the resumption of my terms here, what I would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that, that is still going to be the case. The encryption business, as I described, will have to move here at a certain time, because you just can't put that off, but so long. So that was the basis of my timing statement. The communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS, are in the test at NIE next month, and we expect LRIP-II decisions that are in the plan. We have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Riflemen radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that, that's going to happen. So what am I saying? I'm saying then that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good shape just to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered.

We're likely to have another one. We've got the reality of award delays."" We got -- because of that or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding Pentagon [ph] renovation, Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs -- these are good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see it through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change, but right now, the best vision we have says, we think we can get there."

But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the check's in the mail to a certain extent here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained ""normal activity"" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated fund. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and that I don't see frankly -- I guess, the comment I would make would be the competition you see, in particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for -- the IT Service business is probably about 1/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline, and part of that decline in IT service frankly is biz lost, my term, in this hypercompetitive environment which gets to your point on these."

General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year second quarter and this year's first quarter.Earnings",3338,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year second quarter and this year's first quarter.
Earnings per share totaled $1.77 on a fully diluted basis, $0.20 ahead of last quarter. Second quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $703 million or 111% of earnings from continuing operations. This result was particularly strong, considering that it includes approximately $100 million in pension fund contribution, 2 quarterly Federal tax payments and continued investment in streams Savannah campus. We plan to contribute about $500 million in total to our pension plans this year with most of the remainder in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, free cash flow is $1 billion or 86% of earnings from continuing operations. On the capital's deployment front, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and top market conditions to repurchase 7.8 million shares of common stock this quarter. Through the first half, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares.
Additionally, we had announced the acquisition of IP Wireless, an excellent bolt-on addition for our IS&T business. IP Wireless further expands our technical communications portfolio into the public safety, first responder market, with advanced broadband technology that improves first responders' effectiveness and safety by providing them with greater access to information.
Orders this quarter were approximately $5.2 billion, reflecting continued sluggishness in defense award activity and some slower-than-anticipated order timing in Aerospace. I do anticipate improved second-half orders, particularly in Aerospace.
At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $43.9 billion, while total backlog stood at $52.4 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.6 million.
Before I turned to the results and outlook for each of our groups, I want to comment on what we are seeing in this dynamic Aerospace and Defense business environment. In our U.S. defense market, visibility remain somewhat limited by 3 principal factors: the upcoming elections, a likely 2013 continuing resolution, and the sequestration trigger.
The uncertainty and anxiety spawned by these second half events continues to impede Department of Defense Federal Government acquisition program execution. As was the case last quarter, our shorter cycle IS&T business is experiencing the most pressure, due primarily to award delays on several of our key tactical communications contracts. In most cases, these are funded programs of record. While there are -- while there was improvement in activity from first to second quarter, this order activity did not meet our expectations.
As anticipated, we are witnessing increased rhetorical as the summer progresses and the political process continues to navigate the final months of the campaign trail.
As we steam towards a sequestration fund bank, many members of Congress had began talking more seriously about sequestration and its potential impacts. We remain hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be brokered. However, as a practical matter, it seems increasingly unlikely that we will see additional detail on implementation or resolution before the November elections.
We are focused on what we can control. Specifically, we're executing on our backlog, working with our customers to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds, talking with our suppliers, analyzing our contract Terms and Conditions, and judiciously husbanding our capital resources. Nevertheless, forecasting our customer's behavior has become increasingly difficult. Given this uncertainty, we have adjusted our expectations somewhat for the year. Our outlook thus assume the obligation we previously appropriated funds on several of our programs where delays have been prominent. With that said, the 2013 defense budget request is proceeding through the Congressional approval process. We've been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. In the likely event that the 2013 Pentagon budget is funded at least for some period of time through a continuing resolution, our programs would reflect relatively healthy 2012 funding levels.
In our Aerospace group, Gulfstream continues to enjoy a sizable, multi-year large cabin backlog in a robust order pipeline. The fidelity of our backlog is evidenced by the extremely limited default of activity this quarter and point of fact, this was the lowest default fourth quarter since the economic downturn began in 2008.
We are seeing, however, some elongation of our business jet order cycle with a number of factors, causing deal closure times to increase.
In part, order delays, most of which materialized late in the quarter, reflect the decline in global economic sentiments. We continue to believe that we will realize many of these orders, although their timing and in some cases, their scope, may vary from initial discussion.
Now let me turn to each of our groups, starting with Combat Systems.
Combat Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second of 2011. Sales totaled $2.15 billion, reflecting growing FMS volume for vehicles and tanks, initial progress on the Ground Combat Vehicle program, and the addition of Texan.
Abrams' tank volume and European Land Systems volume were down somewhat as expected. The group's earnings were $322 million, resulting in 50% operating margins. This operating margin reflects excellent performance across combats portfolio of mature, domestic vehicle production programs. In addition, profitability continues to be enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.
Combat Systems backlog totaled $9.8 billion at quarter end, although the group's orders improved from last quarter, orders in combat weapon systems and European vehicles segments were somewhat lighter than anticipated due to several international program delays. Notable orders that were received, included approximately $270 million for Hydra rockets, $170 million for Abrams upgrades and support, and $115 million for Stryker Double-V Hall conversions and logistic support.
The Stryker Double-V Hall conversion order is particularly significant as it reaffirms the customer's acceptance of the life-saving benefit of the double-V hull and it begins the process of converting another brigade of Stryker to the double-V configuration.
In the second half, we expect order activity to improve with additional awards for Strykers, MRAP enhancements and international tank upgrades for several Middle Eastern customers to include 200 tanks from Morocco.
We also expect a significant Abrams award that will fund tank research and development activities over the next several years.
This investment is proof of our customer's long-term commitment to investing in and modernizing this integral component of the army's fighting force.
Abrams tank also continues to receive staunch Congressional support with each of the 3 committees that has Mark BuSpar adding funds to sustain Abrams production.
This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base.
Combat is on track to achieve my guidance of around $8.5 billion in sales this year. A variety of drivers in our European Land Systems business, including reduced profitability on several vehicle programs, delays in several international awards, and absorption impact from lower-than-anticipated volume, will cause the group's earnings to be somewhat lower than anticipated. Consequently, the groups operating margins will likely be closer to the mid-13% range.
Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered another very solid quarter. Sales and earnings at $1.7 billion and $183 million respectively, were up for the group collectively, and at all 3 shipyards, when compared with the prior-year periods. Marine stronger sales performance reflects higher submarine and Destroyer volume, partially offset by lower T-AKE volume when compared with last year's second quarter.
The group's repair related sales also increased in the quarter, due primarily to our third quarter 2011 acquisition of Northrop based Metro Machine, now known as Maskell Northrup. Integration of this acquisition is going well and we continue to be excited about naval ship repair opportunities.
In order to better leverage this growth market, in the second quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the ship repair and coatings division of Earl Industries. Earl will provide General Dynamics,  a role as current contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier or multi-ship, multi-option contracts, and Ms. Vos, further enhanced our ability to deliver cost-effective repair and maintenance service on both coasts and extend the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Northrup and Maple.
Group margins in the quarter improved 90 basis points over last year's second quarter to 11.1%, driven primarily by strong performance on the T-AKE program.
Our 3 shipyards were busy delivering ships our needy customers in the second quarter, including T-AKE 13, the U.S. Medgar Evers, DDG 112, USS Michael Murphy, the final ship in the original DDG-51 program, and SSN 782, the USS Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine. The group's backlog was $17 billion at quarter end, including several key new orders, such as a $65 million contract to provide planning yard services for DDG 51 class destroyers, and FFG 7 class frigates and the $80 million contract to purchase long lead materials for the next block, Block IV, of 9 Virginia-class submarines. We are currently preparing our bid for Block IV, expected later next year and the SSBN replacement program design contract, which should be awarded by year end.
We also recently submitted our bid for the Navy DDG 51 multiyear program. This 9-ship contract, which includes an option for a tenth ship, is expected to be awarded early next year.
Other opportunities for the group include additional repair work and the potential for some Jones Act commercial ships.
Overall, 2012 saless should be modestly below 2011, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, marine margins for the year should be in the low 11% range, somewhat better than my earlier guidance.
Now, to IS&T. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our IS&T group was challenged again in the second quarter, as customer award activity continued to fall short of expectations. Group sales were $2.5 billion while earnings were $226 million, up modestly from first quarter, but off slightly from our expectations.
Similar to the first quarter, volume weakness was driven by shortfalls in our tactical Communications business. Last quarter, I highlighted the 3 areas which are causing weakness in our Communications business. Award delays in our shorter cycle products, especially encryption hardware, is lower than anticipated transition to the Common Hardware Systems-4 program, and the sluggish ramp in several programs moving from development to production, most notably JTRS and WIN-T. We made some progress on encryption orders in the second quarter, although we did not completely need our forecast. We do expect good third quarter encryption volume, particularly as the government's fourth fiscal quarter has historically been a strong award period for our short cycle products.
The CHS-4 program was again a driver of the group's volume weakness in the second quarter, although improved somewhat from the first quarter. As a reminder, this is a $3.7 billion 5-year single source IDIQ contract that purchases from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Slowing operational tempo has impacted demand when compared with the prior contracts. However, current customer demand far outpaces the orders we have received year-to-date.
We have lowered our full year expectations for this contract, but believe that orders will improve somewhat in the second half.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate our capability in the quarter, including participating in the army's recent network integration evaluation. While test reports are still preliminary, we have every reason to believe that our HMS Manpack and WIN-T implement 2 products performed extremely well.
Similarly, our HMS riflemen radio received Pentagon approval for procurement of another 13,000 radios. Despite the demonstrated success and progress of our programs, the obligation of funding in awards for these programs continues to fall behind program a record timeline. We are working closely with our customer on these issues and continue to expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as riflemen and Manpack radios in the second half.
Volume in IT service business was essentially flat this quarter as the addition of several businesses in 2011 offset lower workload on several major IT into structure support projects which have concluded.
IS&T operating margins were 8.9% in the second quarter. This result reflects a lack of award activity and our higher returns, product-oriented tactical communications business and the overall portfolio mix shift toward service work as I mentioned in the first quarter call.
IS&T, like the rest of our businesses, remains focused on profitability and competitiveness. The group continues to be aggressive in targeting cost to include facility consolidations, restructuring the business units and staffing reductions. These actions should afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
The group's backlog totaled $9.3 billion at the quarter, while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and potential ID/IQ Awards totaled $31 billion. Order activity was particularly healthy at our IT Services business this quarter, with several new opportunities captured to serve a wide range of customers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and NATO.
Even amidst a slower order cadence, our Tactical Communications business captured several key adjacent market wins, including a $365 million, 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the FAA's air to ground radius and a $385 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the army's updated fleet of range radar systems.
These wins diversify our tactical communications end markets. Moving forward and highlight our focus on seeking new opportunities where we can apply our core competencies.
IS&T's proposal activity remains quite robust and we are maintaining our new capture rates. While forecasting remains extremely challenging in this market, we anticipate book-to-bill to improve in the second half and full year book-to-bill ratio approximate 1x. In light of the group's first half results, I expect full-year sales to be down 7% when compared with last year. This revised outlook which assumes just over $500 million of incremental volume in the second half, reflects the realities we experienced in the first half and our best estimate of how our customers will behave in the second half. Most of the incremental volume will come from our IS&T -- our IT Services business, including a significant portion that is in backlog today. At Tactical Communications volume improves in the second half, I would expect margins to expand from the 9% level achieved in the first half to yield full year group margins around 9.3%.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 16% from the year-ago quarter due primarily to bringing G650 deliveries. When compared with the first quarter, revenues were down modestly due to the timing of several large cabin aircraft deliveries. Earnings totaled $257 million, resulting in a 16.1% group operating margin. The group's operating margins improved 90 basis points when compared with last year's period due to both improved results of Jet Aviation, an excellent performance at Gulfstream. A variety of factors including mix and rightsizing actions taken at Jet plus margins to the contract 60 basis points sequentially.
Jet Aviation continues to make positive progress. In the quarter, we delivered the remaining 2 narrowbody wide-body aircraft that have experienced significant costs growth. And in an effort to continue improving its competitiveness, yet reorganize its Basel operations, which resulted in further employee reductions. The Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing new completions opportunities.
Jet service operations continue to do well to include modest volume improvement from the year-ago period and flat revenue sequentially. This performance reflects the dichotomy of increased demand across some markets, such as Asia, and decreased maintenance repair demand in Europe as the region copes with continued economic uncertainty.
We've taken a hard look at our European service operations and are taking appropriate actions to reshape that footprint.
As we look forward, Jet's global service footprint remains a strategic advantage for our Aerospace group. In the very near term, Jet's London Big and Hill FBO the closes business aviation airport to the Olympic Park, is already seen any increase in traffic from visitors for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Broader Aerospace market indicators were mixed this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, orders were softer than expected due to the timing in the second quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill at 0.6x on a dollar-denominated basis. When combined with continued G650 deliveries, this a long gauge in of the order cycle cost the groups backlog to decline to approximately $16.3 billion. While lower, this healthy backlog continues to keep us in an 18 to 24-month delivery window for our G450 and G550 product, and G650 backlog remains approximately 5 years in duration. As I mentioned previously, because new orders for the G650 currently have this 5-year entry into service fleet, we do not expect new orders to match plan deliveries the near term.
Through the first half, orders reflect the relative resilience of the large cabin market when compared with mid-cabin. North American customers comprised 60% of the order book year-to-date, reflecting the return of some of our North American customers and some cooling of international demand, particularly in Asia. Gulfstream flying hours were at prerecession levels, pretty healthy consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Bellstream and Jet Aviation services are up almost 5%. We continue to work diligently to ensure that our service network remains well-positioned to serve customers and the growing install global Fleet.
In pursuing this goal, we continue to improve our field on airborne support teams, our fast teams. This teams which were created to decade ago to provide 24/7 customer service support just celebrated their 3,000 mission flight. In the quarter, we announced the addition of Mobile Maintenance Vehicles with to the fast capabilities set. These vehicles will provide a range of services to customers in targeted markets.
Preowned aircraft on the market continued to slow decline in the quarter. We had 1 aircraft in inventory of the beginning of this quarter, took 1 additional preowned in trade during the quarter and had both aircraft available for sale at quarter end.
On the product development front, the G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in the second quarter. Both aircraft set city records en route to eBay's in Geneva, in May. The G280 is now completed all of its FAA flying and we're working to the final stages of certification. We are nearly complete with the FAA's required G650 flight testing and remain on track to obtain a third quarter type certification.
We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering about 24 green G650 aircraft this year and around 17 completions with most of these completions happening in the fourth quarter.
For the year, I expect the group sales to grow approximately 15%, in line with my prior guidance, as large as mid cabin and production green deliveries plan for the year remain on track at just over 100 and 10 to 15 respectively.
Margins will be in the mid-15% range, somewhat higher than previously expected, given Gulfstream strong performance through the first half.
In summary, General Dynamics executed very well with this quarter and I expect that performance to continue in the second half.
However, given first half results and a difficult reality of forecasting for IS&T in the certain period, I'm adjusting my EPS range to $7 to $7.10. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment for capital.
We have a lot of work to accomplish in the second half as we deal with the defense uncertainties before us, achieve G650 and G280 type certification and begin detailed planning for 2013. With these tasks ahead, Phoebe Novakovic, as you know will assume my role as Chairman and CEO at the beginning of next year, is concentrating her efforts on the operation of this Corporation and our 2013 planning process. Amidst this decidedly dynamic business climate, all of us at General Dynamics remain laser-focused on the things we can control and on doing what we do best, executing.
And with that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

First, net interest expense was $37 million for the quarter versus $31 million in 2011. For 2012, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million, reflecting the full-year impact of our fixed rate amounts issued in July of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $1 billion of net debt. Second, I'd like to point out an item impacting the comparability of our results, that being the sale of the Texans business in the second quarter 2011. This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $38 million or about $0.07 in other income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 31.5% for the first 6 months compared with 30.8% for the same period in 2011.
For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 amount but due primarily to the absence of the R&D tax credit for 2012, but also due to the less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower.
Amy, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the question and answer."

We believe the second half order activity will be stronger as I said in my remarks. Example, let me just talk the demographics. 60% of our first quarter, our first half orders came from North America. Within that set, we had several, shall we say, multi-aircraft fleet buys, if you will, that moved out of the quarter, not off the page, just out of the quarter. And we anticipate those to be with us in the order book before the end of the year. And really, that probably has as much to do with North America with the order circumstance, if you will, as anything. So last year, just to further comment on North America, last year, at the midyear, about 28% as I recall, of our orders were North American and as I said before, 60% this year. So the North American market at large is becoming a bigger part of our order book which we like a lot. Conversely we saw great softness in Europe, not unexpected by anyone and some in Asia, which frankly, we attributed this stage more to timing than anything. What does that mean? That means this year -- I don't have the exact percentage in my head, but last year's midyear order book was like 49% Asia-Pacific and this year, it was down in the high teens as I recall. So there has been some cooling, as I said in my remarks but again we had a lot of fleet activity last year that hasn't manifested itself yet this year, but because of ongoing discussions, et cetera, we have -- we believe that there will be more activity coming out of Asia in the second half is probably the cleanest way to say it."

That will conclude here very shortly. Once that occurs, then it becomes a matter of putting it all together, my word, not probably the proper word, administratively if you will, in laying all that out and then getting working with the FAA to get yourself to an agreed-upon time to execute the type certification. We're on track for that. I have no indication that we're not. So I'm getting excited about it actually. I try to throttle my cell back, but that's on track. Once that happens and as that happens, once the flying's done, they'll start training the crews towards the aircraft to be delivered, et cetera, as we talked before and you'll see then entering the service. Within the matter, I should think of weeks after the type certification occurs. So we're marching on the timeline very aggressively and visibly, I would add. They're doing lots of flying right now but we're almost done with it. The service business, Howard, I mentioned, I think, the service business was up like up 5% for the first half. I would expect it to probably stay kind of flat for the rest of the year. And why do I say that? Because of the lack of activity, for example, that we're seeing in Europe right now. I don't see that getting any better for the rest of the year. It's causing us to have to reshape our European business somewhat at Jet as I mentioned earlier the service business is doing fine but I don't expect it to outperform the first half in the second half. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised on that but I just don't see it right now. And we measure that in lots of different ways not the least of which is looking at what visibility our service centers have on their order books and it's still pretty close the board. Not a lot of long-term appointments for discretionary repair and upgrade. So it's still a very strong business for us but I don't see much more than flat for the rest of the year."

That robust force structure must include lots of ships and as I've said before, presence really does make a difference and so you have to be there. Particularly when you're dealing now with the realities in the Pacific where the turn of distance causes you to be unable to be in multiple places at the same time very easily. So all that bodes well when you're a Navy shipbuilder for your future opportunities. As to your comment about the Virginia class, the Virginia-class submarine in that program itself, is what I would call close to a model program as the Department of Defense has and we're very proud of that and we bring those boats in at the price tag that was -- I think, the public price tag is like $2 billion a boat. And point of fact, we delivered the Mississippi $60 million under budget and the year early. So we know how to build Virginia-class submarines. There is no substitute for the Virginia-class submarine in my humble opinion and I don't think that may need to argue with. We need them the number that's why Block IV will become a reality and they're probably be a Block V after that. So. The customers are looking at cost all the time on things like SSBN(X) but we still must have a fleet of major platforms. LCS will have its role but we're still going to be making manufacturing lots of, in Jay Johnson's humble opinion and I think that maybe we would agree lots of major surface combatants, aircraft carriers and nuclear powered submarines in the auxiliaries that will be needed to service them around the globe.

General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. Earni",3335,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. 
Earnings per share totaled $1.77 on a fully diluted basis, $0.20 ahead of last quarter. 
Second quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $703 million or 111% of earnings from continuing operations. This result was particularly strong, considering that it includes approximately $100 million in pension funds contribution, 2 quarterly federal tax payments and continued investment in Gulfstream's Savannah campus. We plan to contribute about $500 million in total to our pension plans this year with most of the remainder in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, free cash flow is $1 billion or 86% of earnings from continuing operations. 
On the capital's deployment front, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and top market conditions to repurchase 7.8 million shares of common stock this quarter. Through the first half, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares.
Additionally, we had announced the acquisition of IPWireless, an excellent bolt-on addition for our IS&T business. IPWireless further expands our technical communications portfolio into the public safety first responder market with advanced broadband technology that improves first responders' effectiveness and safety by providing them with greater access to information.
Orders this quarter were approximately $5.2 billion, reflecting continued sluggishness in defense award activity and some slower-than-anticipated order timing in Aerospace. I do anticipate improved second-half orders, particularly in Aerospace.
At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $43.9 billion while total backlog stood at $52.4 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.6 billion.
Before I turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, I want to comment on what we are seeing in this dynamic aerospace and defense business environment. In our U.S. defense market, visibility remains somewhat limited by 3 principal factors: the upcoming elections, a likely 2013 continuing resolution and the sequestration trigger.
The uncertainty and anxiety spawned by these second half events continues to impede Department of Defense and federal government acquisition program execution. As was the case last quarter, our shorter-cycle IS&T business is experiencing the most pressure, due primarily to award delays on several of our key tactical communications contracts. In most cases, these are funded programs of record. While there are -- excuse me, while there was improvement in activity from first to second quarter, this order activity did not meet our expectations.
As anticipated, we are witnessing increased rhetoric as the summer progresses and the political process prepares to navigate the final months of the campaign trail.
As we steam towards the sequestration fogbank, many members of Congress had begun talking more seriously about sequestration and its potential impacts. We remain hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be brokered. However, as a practical matter, it seems increasingly unlikely that we will see additional detail on implementation or resolution before the November elections.
We are focused on what we can control. Specifically, we're executing on our backlog, working with our customers to jump-start the expenditure of previously appropriated funds, talking with our suppliers, analyzing our contract terms and conditions and judiciously husbanding our capital resources. Nevertheless, forecasting our customer's behavior has become increasingly difficult. 
Given this uncertainty, we have adjusted our expectations somewhat for the year. Our outlook does assume the obligation of previously appropriated funds on several of our programs where delays have been prominent. With that said, the 2013 defense budget request is proceeding through the congressional approval process. We've been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. In the likely event that the 2013 Pentagon budget is funded, at least for some period of time, through a continuing resolution, our programs would reflect relatively healthy 2012 funding levels.
In our Aerospace group, Gulfstream continues to enjoy a sizable, multi-year large cabin backlog in a robust order pipeline. The fidelity of our backlog is evidenced by the extremely limited default of activity this quarter. And point of fact, this was the lowest default quarter since the economic downturn began in 2008. We are seeing, however, some elongation of our business jet order cycle with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. In part, order delays, most of which materialized late in the quarter, reflect the decline in global economic sentiment. 
We continue to believe that we will realize many of these orders although their timing, and in some cases, their scope, may vary from initial discussions.
Now let me turn to each of our groups, starting with Combat Systems.
Combat Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second of 2011. Sales totaled $2.15 billion, reflecting growing FMS volume for vehicles and tanks, initial progress on the Ground Combat Vehicle program and the addition of Force Protection.  Abrams tank volume and European Land Systems volume were down somewhat as expected. The group's earnings were $322 million, resulting in 15% operating margins. This operating margin reflects excellent performance across Combats' portfolio of mature domestic vehicle production programs. In addition, profitability continues to be enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.
Combat Systems backlog totaled $9.8 billion at quarter end. Although the group's orders improved from last quarter, orders in Combats' weapon systems and European vehicles segments were somewhat lighter than anticipated due to several international program delays. Notable orders that were received included approximately $270 million for Hydra rockets, $170 million for Abrams upgrades and support, and $115 million for Stryker double-v hull conversions and logistics support.
The Stryker double-V hull conversion order is particularly significant as it reaffirms the customer's acceptance of the life-saving benefit of the double-V hull and begins the process of converting another brigade of Strykers to the double-V configuration.
In the second half, we expect order activity to improve with additional awards for Strykers, MRAP enhancements and international tank upgrades for several Middle Eastern customers to include 200 tanks from Morocco.
We also expect a significant Abrams award that will fund tank research and development activities over the next several years. This investment is proof of our customer's long-term commitment to investing in and modernizing this integral component of the army's fighting force.
The Abrams tank also continues to receive staunch congressional support with each of the 3 committees that is marked, thus far, adding funds to sustain Abrams production. This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base.
Combat is on track to achieve my guidance of around $8.5 billion in sales this year. A variety of drivers in our European Land Systems business including reduced profitability on several vehicle programs, delays in several international awards, and absorption impact from lower-than-anticipated volume will cause the group's earnings to be somewhat lower than anticipated. Consequently, the group's operating margins will likely be closer to the mid-13% range.
Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered another very solid quarter. Sales and earnings at $1.7 billion and $183 million, respectively, were up for the group collectively and at all 3 shipyards when compared with the prior year periods. Marine's stronger sales performance reflects higher submarine and destroyer volume, partially offset by lower T-AKE volume when compared with last year's second quarter.
The group's repair-related sales also increased in the quarter, due primarily to our third quarter 2011 acquisition of  Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Integration of this acquisition is going well, and we continue to be excited about naval ship repair opportunities.
In order to better leverage this growth market, in the second quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the Ship Repair and Coatings Division of Earl Industries. Earl will provide General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option contracts, MSMOs, to further enhance our ability to deliver cost-effective repair and maintenance service on both coasts and extend the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport.
Group margins in the quarter improved 90 basis points over last year's second quarter to 11.1%, driven primarily by strong performance on the T-AKE program.
Our 3 shipyards were busy delivering ships to our navy customers in the second quarter including T-AKE 13; the USNS Medgar Evers; DDG 112; USS Michael Murphy, the final ship in the original DDG 51 program; and SSN 782, the USS Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine. 
The group's backlog was $17 billion at quarter end including several key new orders such as a $65 million contract to provide planning yard services for DDG 51 class destroyers and FFG 7 class frigates and the $80 million contract to purchase long lead materials for the next block, Block IV, of 9 Virginia-class submarines. 
We are currently preparing our bid for Block IV, expected later this -- next year, excuse me, and the SSBN replacement program design contract, which should be awarded by year end. We also recently submitted our bid for the Navy DDG 51 multiyear program. This 9-ship contract, which includes an option for a 10th ship, is expected to be awarded early next year.
Other opportunities for the group include additional repair work and the potential for some Jones Act commercial ships.
Overall, 2012 sales should be modestly below 2011, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the low 11% range, somewhat better than my earlier guidance.
Now, to IS&T. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our IS&T group was challenged again in the second quarter as customer award activity continued to fall short of expectations. Group sales were $2.5 billion while earnings were $226 million, up modestly from first quarter but off slightly from our expectations.
Similar to the first quarter, volume weakness was driven by shortfalls in our tactical communications business. Last quarter, I highlighted the 3 areas which are causing weakness in our communications business. Award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; a slower-than-anticipated transition to the Common Hardware Systems-4 program; and the sluggish ramp in several programs moving from development to production, most notably JTRS and WIN-T. 
We made some progress on encryption orders in the second quarter, although we did not completely  meet our forecast. We do expect good third quarter encryption volume, particularly as the government's fourth physical -- fiscal quarter has historically been a strong award period for our short-cycle products.
The CHS-4 program was again a driver of the group's volume weakness in the second quarter, although improved somewhat from the first quarter. As a reminder, this is a $3.7 billion 5-year single-source IDIQ contract that purchases from across the military and other government agencies and used to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Slowing operational tempo has impacted demand when compared with the prior contracts. However, current customer demand far outpaces the orders we have received year-to-date. We have lowered our full year expectations for this contract, but believe that orders will improve somewhat in the second half.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continued to demonstrate their capability in the quarter, including participating in the army's recent Network Integration Evaluation. While test reports are still preliminary, we have every reason to believe that our HMS Manpack and WIN-T Increment 2 products performed extremely well.
Similarly, our HMS Rifleman radio received Pentagon approval for procurement of another 13,000 radios. Despite the demonstrated success and progress of our programs, the obligation of funding and awards for these programs continued to fall behind program and record time line. We are working closely with our customer on these issues and continue to expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios in the second half.
Volume in our IT service business was essentially flat this quarter as the addition of several businesses in 2011 offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects, which have concluded.
IS&T operating margins were 8.9% in the second quarter. This result reflects the lack of award activity in our higher-return, product-oriented tactical communications business and the overall portfolio mix shift toward service work as I mentioned in the first quarter call.
IS&T, like the rest of our businesses, remain focused on profitability and competitiveness. The group continues to be aggressive in targeting costs to include facility consolidations, restructuring a business unit and staffing reductions. These actions should afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
The group's backlog totaled $9.3 billion at the quarter end while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and potential IDIQ awards totaled $31 billion. Order activity was particularly healthy at our IT services business this quarter with several new opportunities captured to serve a wide range of customers including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and NATO.
Even amidst a slower order cadence, our tactical communications business captured several key adjacent market wins including a $365 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the FAA's air-to-ground radios and a $385 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the Army's outdated fleet of range radar systems. These wins diversify our tactical communications end markets moving forward and highlight our focus on seeking new opportunities where we can apply our core competencies.
IS&T's proposal activity remains quite robust, and we are maintaining our new capture rates. While forecasting remains extremely challenging in this market, we anticipate book-to-bill to improve in the second half and full year book-to-bill to approximate 1x. 
In light of the group's first half results, I expect full year sales to be down 7% when compared with last year. This revised outlook, which assumes just over $500 million of incremental volume in the second half, reflects the realities we experienced in the first half and our best estimate of how our customers will behave in the second half. Most of the incremental volume will come from our IST -- excuse me, our IT services business, including a significant portion that is in backlog today. As tactical communications volume improves in the second half, I would expect margins to expand from the 9% level achieved in the first half to yield full year group margins around 9.3%.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 16% from the year ago quarter, due primarily to bringing green G650 deliveries. When compared with the first quarter, revenues were down modestly due to the timing of several large cabin aircraft deliveries. 
Earnings totaled $257 million, resulting in a 16.1% group operating margin. The group's operating margins improved 90 basis points when compared with last year's period, due to both improved results of Jet Aviation, an excellent performance of Gulfstream. A variety of factors including mix and rightsizing actions taken at Jet caused margins to the contract 60 basis points sequentially.
Jet Aviation continues to make positive progress. In the quarter, we delivered the remaining 2 narrow-body wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. And in an effort to continue improving its competitiveness, Jet reorganized its Basel operations, which resulted in further employee reductions. The Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing new completions opportunities.
Jet's service operations continue to do well to include modest volume improvement from the year ago period and flat revenues sequentially. This performance reflects the dichotomy of increased demand across some markets, such as Asia, and decreased maintenance repair demand in Europe as the region copes with continued economic uncertainty.
We've taken a hard look at our European service operations and are taking appropriate actions to reshape that footprint.
As we look forward, Jet's global service footprint remains a strategic advantage for our Aerospace group. In the very near term, Jet's London Biggin Hill FBO, the closest business aviation airport to the Olympic Park, has already seen an increase in traffic from visitors for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. 
Broader aerospace market indicators were mixed this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, orders were softer than expected due to the timing with second quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill at 0.6x on a dollar-denominated basis. When combined with continued G650 deliveries, this elongation of the order cycle caused the group's backlog to decline to approximately $16.3 billion. While lower, this healthy backlog continues to keep us in an 18- to 24-month delivery window for our G450 and G550 products, and G650 backlog remains approximately 5 years in duration. As I've mentioned previously, because new orders for the G650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we do not expect new orders to match planned deliveries the near term.
Through the first half, orders reflect the relative resilience of the large cabin market when compared with mid-cabin. North American customers comprised 60% of the order book year-to-date, reflecting the return of some of our North American customers and some cooling of international demand, particularly in Asia. Gulfstream flying hours were at prerecession levels, pretty healthy, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Bellstream and Jet Aviation services are up almost 5%. We continue to work diligently to ensure that our service network remains well-positioned to serve customers in the growing install global fleet.
In pursuit of this goal, we continue to improve our Field and Airborne Support Teams, our FAST teams. These teams, which were created to decade ago to provide 24/7 customer service support, just celebrated their 3,000 mission flight. In the quarter, we announced the addition of Mobile Maintenance Vehicles with to the FAST capability set. These vehicles will provide a range of services to customers in targeted markets.
Preowned aircraft on the market continued to slowly decline in the quarter. We had 1 aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this quarter, took 1 additional preowned in trade during the quarter and had both aircraft available for sale at quarter end.
On the product development front, the G650 and G280 development programs continued to make progress in the second quarter. Both aircraft set city-pair records en route to EBACE in Geneva in May. The G280 has now completed all of its FAA flying and we're working through the final stages of certification. We are nearly complete with the FAA's required G650 flight testing and remain on track to obtain a third quarter-type certification.
We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering about 24 green G650 aircraft this year and around 17 completions with most of these completions happening in the fourth quarter.
For the year, I expect the group sales to grow approximately 15% in line with my prior guidance, as large- and mid-cabin in-production green deliveries plan for the year remain on track at just over 100 and 10 to 15, respectively. Margins will be in the mid-15% range, somewhat higher than previously expected given Gulfstream's strong performance through the first half.
In summary, General Dynamics executed very well this quarter and I expect that performance to continue in the second half. However, given first half results and the difficult reality of forecasting for IS&T in this uncertain period, I'm adjusting my EPS range to $7 to $7.10. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital.
We have a lot of work to accomplish in the second half as we deal with the defense uncertainties before us, achieve G650 and G280 type certification and begin detailed planning for 2013. With these tasks ahead, Phebe Novakovic, who, as you know, will assume my role as Chairman and CEO at the beginning of next year, is concentrating her efforts on the operation of this corporation and our 2013 planning process. 
Amidst this decidedly dynamic business climate, all of us at General Dynamics remain laser-focused on the things we can control and on doing what we do best: executing.
And with that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

For 2012, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million, reflecting the full year impact of our fixed rate notes issued in July of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $1 billion of net debt. 
Second, I'd like to point out an item impacting the comparability of our results, that being the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $38 million or about $0.07 in other income. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 31.5% for the first 6 months compared with 30.8% for the same period in 2011.
For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 amount, but due primarily to the absence of the R&D tax credit for 2012 but also due to the less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower.

That means, this year -- I don't have the exact percentage in my head, but last year's midyear order book was like 49% Asia Pacific and this year it was down in the high teens, as I recall. So there has been some cooling, as I said in my remarks. But again, we had a lot of fleet activity last year that hasn't manifested itself yet this year, but because of ongoing discussions, et cetera, we have -- we believe that there will be more activity coming out of Asia in the second half is probably the cleanest way to say it."

The 650 certification, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're getting very close to completion of the flight test activity that'll conclude here very shortly. Once that occurs, then it becomes a matter of putting it all together, my word, not probably the proper word, administratively, if you will, in laying all that out and then getting with -- working with the FAA to get yourself to an agreed-upon time to execute the type certification. We're on track for that. I have no indication that we're not. So I'm getting excited about it actually. I try to throttle myself back, but that's on track. Once that happens and as that happens, okay, once the flying's done, they will -- they'll start training the crews for the aircraft to be delivered, et cetera, as we had talked before. And you'll see then entry into service within a matter, I should think, of weeks after the type certification occurs. So we're marching down that time line very aggressively and visibly, I would add. They're doing lots of flying right now, but we're almost done with it. The service business, Howard, I mentioned, I think, the service business was up like up 5% for the first half. I would expect it to probably stay kind of flat for the rest of the year. I don't -- and why do I say that? Because the lack of activity, for example, that we're seeing in Europe right now, I don't see that getting any better for the rest of the year. It's causing us to have to reshape our European business somewhat at Jet, as I mentioned earlier, so the service business is doing fine, but I don't expect it to outperform the first half in the second half. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised on that but I just don't see it right now. And we measure that in lots of different ways, not the least of which is looking at what visibility our service centers have on their order books and it's still pretty close the board. Not a lot of long-term appointments for discretionary repair and upgrade. So it's still a very strong business for us, but I don't see much more than flat for the rest of the year."

When you look at the [indiscernible] tempo, clearly the Navy is small for the missions being asked of it. You've got the Navy stretched thin over Central Command and at the same time being to asked to cover significant areas in the Pacific command. The pivot at the Pacific has been long in the making, but I don't think anyone foresaw how much the Navy will be tasked over Central Command. So it's clear that the Navy budget faces real strain in terms of the needs from warships. And I'm just wondering if you could give us color on what kind of discussions you're having with your Navy as they wrangle with solving this problem. Is there kind of examination into basically maybe buying more lower-cost surface combatants or the Virginia-class sub was supposed to be a low-cost sub today downsized yet again and develop less costly subs. Can you maybe add some vibrancy to kind of how you're working with the customer kind of wrestle with this?"

Mean, we are global navy, over 90% of the world's commerce moves by sea, by volume, as I recall. I don't think that will change certainly not anytime soon. And with that as a reality, United States Navy must maintain a robust force structure. That robust force structure must include lots of ships. And as I've said before, presence really does make a difference, and so you have to be there particularly when you're dealing now with the realities in the Pacific where the tyranny of distance causes you to be unable to be in multiple places at the same time very easily. So all that bodes well when you're a Navy shipbuilder for your future opportunities. As to your comment about the Virginia-class, the Virginia-class submarine in that program, itself, is what I would call as close to a model program as the Department of Defense has and we're very proud of that and we bring those boats in at the price tag that was -- I think, the public price tag is like $2 billion a boat. And point of fact, we delivered the Mississippi $60 million under budget and a year early. So we know how to build Virginia-class submarines. There is no substitute for the Virginia-class submarine in my humble opinion, and I don't think the Navy to argue with. We need them in number, that's why Block IV will become a reality and there'll probably be a Block V after that. So the customer is looking at costs all the time on things like SSBN(X), but we still must have a fleet of major platforms. LCS will have its role, but we're still going to be making -- manufacturing lots of, in Jay Johnson's humble opinion and I think the Navy would agree, lots of major surface combatants, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines and the auxiliaries that will be needed to service them around the globe.

General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. Earni",3326,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. 
Earnings per share totaled $1.77 on a fully diluted basis, $0.20 ahead of last quarter. 
Second quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $703 million or 111% of earnings from continuing operations. This result was particularly strong, considering that it includes approximately $100 million in pension fund contribution, 2 quarterly federal tax payments and continued investment in Gulfstream's Savannah campus. We plan to contribute about $500 million in total to our pension plans this year with most of the remainder in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, free cash flow is $1 billion or 86% of earnings from continuing operations. 
On the capital deployment front, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and tough market conditions to repurchase 7.8 million shares of common stock this quarter. Through the first half, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares.
Additionally, we had announced the acquisition of IPWireless, an excellent bolt-on addition for our IS&T business. IPWireless further expands our technical communications portfolio into the public safety first responder market with advanced broadband technology that improves first responders'  effectiveness and safety by providing them with greater access to information.
Orders this quarter were approximately $5.2 billion, reflecting continued sluggishness in defense award activity and some slower-than-anticipated order timing in Aerospace. I do anticipate improved second-half orders, particularly in Aerospace.
At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $43.9 billion while total backlog stood at $52.4 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.6 billion.
Before I turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, I want to comment on what we are seeing in this dynamic aerospace and defense business environment. In our U.S. defense market, visibility remains somewhat limited by 3 principal factors: the upcoming elections, a likely 2013 continuing resolution and the sequestration trigger.
The uncertainty and anxiety spawned by these second-half events continues to impede Department of Defense and federal government acquisition program execution. As was the case last quarter, our shorter-cycle IS&T business is experiencing the most pressure, due primarily to award delays on several of our key tactical communications contracts. In most cases, these are funded programs of record. While there are -- excuse me, while there was improvement in activity from first to second quarter, this order activity did not meet our expectations.
As anticipated, we are witnessing increased rhetoric as the summer progresses and the political process prepares to navigate the final months of the campaign trail.
As we steam towards the sequestration fogbank, many members of Congress have begun talking more seriously about sequestration and its potential impacts. We remain hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be brokered. However, as a practical matter, it seems increasingly unlikely that we will see additional detail on implementation or resolution before the November elections.
We are focused on what we can control. Specifically, we're executing on our backlog; working with our customers to jump-start the expenditure of previously appropriated funds; talking with our suppliers; analyzing our contract terms and conditions; and judiciously husbanding our capital resources. Nevertheless, forecasting our customer's behavior has become increasingly difficult. 
Given this uncertainty, we have adjusted our expectations somewhat for the year. Our outlook does assume the obligation of previously appropriated funds on several of our programs where delays have been prominent. With that said, the 2013 defense budget request is proceeding through the congressional approval process. We've been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. In the likely event that the 2013 Pentagon budget is funded, at least for some period of time through a continuing resolution, our programs would reflect relatively healthy 2012 funding levels.
In our Aerospace group, Gulfstream continues to enjoy a sizable, multi-year large cabin backlog in a robust order pipeline. The fidelity of our backlog is evidenced by the extremely limited default of activity this quarter. And point of fact, this was the lowest default quarter since the economic downturn began in 2008. We are seeing, however, some elongation of our business jet order cycle with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. In part, order delays, most of which materialize late in the quarter, reflect the decline in global economic sentiment. 
We continue to believe that we will realize many of these orders although their timing, and in some cases, their scope, may vary from initial discussions.
Now let me turn to each of our groups, starting with Combat Systems.
Combat Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second of 2011. Sales totaled $2.15 billion, reflecting growing FMS volume for vehicles and tanks, initial progress on the Ground Combat Vehicle program and the addition of Force Protection.  Abrams tank volume and European Land Systems volume were down somewhat as expected. The group's earnings were $322 million, resulting in 15% operating margins. This operating margin reflects excellent performance across Combats' portfolio of mature domestic vehicle production programs. In addition, profitability continues to be enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.
Combat Systems backlog totaled $9.8 billion at quarter end. Although the group's orders improved from last quarter, orders in Combats' weapon systems and European vehicles segments were somewhat lighter than anticipated due to several international program delays. Notable orders that were received included approximately $270 million for Hydra rockets, $170 million for Abrams upgrades and support, and $115 million for Stryker double-V-hull conversions and logistics support.
The Stryker double-V-hull conversion order is particularly significant as it reaffirms the customer's acceptance of the life-saving benefit of the double-V-hull and begins the process of converting another brigade of Strykers to the double-V configuration.
In the second half, we expect order activity to improve with additional awards for Strykers, MRAP enhancements and international tank upgrades for several Middle Eastern customers to include 200 tanks from Morocco.
We also expect a significant Abrams award that will fund tank research and development activities over the next several years. This investment is proof of our customer's long-term commitment to investing in and modernizing this integral component of the Army's fighting force.
The Abrams tank also continues to receive staunch congressional support with each of the 3 committees that is marked, thus far, adding funds to sustain Abrams production. This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base.
Combat is on track to achieve my guidance of around $8.5 billion in sales this year. A variety of drivers in our European Land Systems business including reduced profitability on several vehicle programs, delays in several international awards, and absorption impact from lower-than-anticipated volume will cause the group's earnings to be somewhat lower than anticipated. Consequently, the group's operating margins will likely be closer to the mid-13% range.
Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered another very solid quarter. Sales and earnings at $1.7 billion and $183 million, respectively, were up for the group collectively and at all 3 shipyards when compared with the prior year periods. Marine's stronger sales performance reflects higher submarine and destroyer volume, partially offset by lower T-AKE volume when compared with last year's second quarter.
The group's repair-related sales also increased in the quarter, due primarily to our third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Integration of this acquisition is going well, and we continue to be excited about naval ship repair opportunities.
In order to better leverage this growth market, in the second quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the Ship Repair and Coatings Divisions of Earl Industries. Earl will provide General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier, multi-ship, multi-option contracts, MSMOs; further enhance our ability to deliver cost-effective repair and maintenance service on both coasts; and extend the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport.
Group margins in the quarter improved 90 basis points over last year's second quarter to 11.1%, driven primarily by strong performance on the T-AKE program.
Our 3 shipyards were busy delivering ships to our Navy customers in the second quarter including T-AKE 13; the USNS Medgar Evers; DDG 112; USS Michael Murphy, the final ship in the original DDG 51 program; and SSN 782, the USS Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine. 
The group's backlog was $17 billion at quarter end including several key new orders such as a $65 million contract to provide planning yard services for DDG 51 class destroyers and FFG 7 class frigates and the $80 million contract to purchase long lead materials for the next block, Block IV, of 9 Virginia-class submarines. 
We are currently preparing our bid for Block IV, expected later this -- next year, excuse me, and the SSBN replacement program design contract, which should be awarded by year end. We also recently submitted our bid for the Navy's DDG 51 multiyear program. This 9-ship contract, which includes an option for a 10th ship, is expected to be awarded early next year.
Other opportunities for the group include additional repair work and the potential for some Jones Act commercial ships.
Overall, 2012 sales should be modestly below 2011, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the low 11% range, somewhat better than my earlier guidance.
Now to IS&T. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our IS&T group was challenged again in the second quarter as customer award activity continued to fall short of expectations. Group sales were $2.5 billion while earnings were $226 million, up modestly from first quarter but off slightly from our expectations.
Similar to the first quarter, volume weakness was driven by shortfalls in our tactical communications business. Last quarter, I highlighted the 3 areas which were causing weakness in our communications business. Award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; a slower-than-anticipated transition to the Common Hardware Systems-4 program; and the sluggish ramp in several programs moving from development to production, most notably JTRS and WIN-T. 
We made some progress on encryption orders in the second quarter, although we did not completely meet our forecast. We do expect good third quarter encryption volume, particularly as the government's fourth physical -- fiscal quarter has historically been a strong award period for our short-cycle products.
The CHS-4 program was again a driver of the group's volume weakness in the second quarter, although improved somewhat from the first quarter. As a reminder, this is a $3.7 billion, 5-year single-source IDIQ contract that purchases from across the military and other government agencies and used to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Slowing operational tempo has impacted demand when compared with the prior contracts. However, current customer demand far outpaces the orders we have received year-to-date. We have lowered our full year expectations for this contract, but believe that orders will improve somewhat in the second half.
On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continued to demonstrate their capability in the quarter, including participating in the Army's recent Network Integration Evaluation. While test reports are still preliminary, we have every reason to believe that our HMS Manpack and WIN-T Increment 2 products performed extremely well.
Similarly, our HMS Rifleman radio received Pentagon approval for procurement of another 13,000 radios. Despite the demonstrated success and progress of our programs, the obligation of funding and awards for these programs continues to fall behind program or record time line. We are working closely with our customer on these issues and continue to expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios in the second half.
Volume in our IT service business was essentially flat this quarter as the addition of several businesses in 2011 offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects, which have concluded.
IS&T operating margins were 8.9% in the second quarter. This result reflects the lack of award activity in our higher-return, product-oriented tactical communications business and the overall portfolio mix shift toward service work that I mentioned in the first quarter call.
IS&T, like the rest of our businesses, remain focused on profitability and competitiveness. The group continues to be aggressive in targeting costs to include facility consolidations, restructuring a business unit and staffing reductions. These actions should afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.
The group's backlog totaled $9.3 billion at the quarter end while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and potential IDIQ awards totaled $31 billion. Order activity was particularly healthy at our IT services business this quarter with several new opportunities captured to serve a wide range of customers including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and NATO.
Even amidst a slower order cadence, our tactical communications business captured several key adjacent market wins including a $365 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the FAA's air-to-ground radios and a $385 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the Army's outdated fleet of range radar systems. These wins diversify our tactical communications end markets moving forward and highlight our focus on seeking new opportunities where we can apply our core competencies.
IS&T's proposal activity remains quite robust, and we are maintaining our new capture rates. While forecasting remains extremely challenging in this market, we anticipate book-to-bill to improve in the second half and full year book-to-bill to approximate 1x. 
In light of the group's first half results, I expect full year sales to be down 7% when compared with last year. This revised outlook, which assumes just over $500 million of incremental volume in the second half, reflects the realities we experienced in the first half and our best estimate of how our customers will behave in the second half. Most of the incremental volume will come from our IST -- excuse me, our IT services business, including a significant portion that is in backlog today. As tactical communications volume improves in the second half, I would expect margins to expand from the 9% level achieved in the first half to yield full year group margins around 9.3%.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 16% from the year ago quarter, due primarily to green G650 deliveries. When compared with the first quarter, revenues were down modestly due to the timing of several large-cabin aircraft deliveries. 
Earnings totaled $257 million, resulting in a 16.1% group operating margin. The group's operating margins improved 90 basis points when compared with last year's period, due to both improved results at Jet Aviation and excellent performance at Gulfstream. A variety of factors including mix and rightsizing actions taken at Jet caused margins to contract 60 basis points sequentially.
Jet Aviation continues to make positive progress. In the quarter, we delivered the remaining 2 narrow-body wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. And in an effort to continue improving its competitiveness, Jet reorganized its Basel operations, which resulted in further employee reductions. The Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing new completions opportunities.
Jet's service operations continue to do well to include modest volume improvement from the year ago period and flat revenues sequentially. This performance reflects the dichotomy of increased demand across some markets, such as Asia, and decreased maintenance repair demand in Europe as the region copes with continued economic uncertainty.
We've taken a hard look at our European service operations and are taking appropriate actions to reshape that footprint.
As we look forward, Jet's global service footprint remains a strategic advantage for our Aerospace group. In the very near term, Jet's London Biggin Hill FBO, the closest business aviation airport to the Olympic Park, has already seen an increase in traffic from visitors to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. 
Broader aerospace market indicators were mixed this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, orders were softer than expected due to the timing with second quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill at 0.6x on a dollar-denominated basis. When combined with continued G650 deliveries, this elongation of the order cycle caused the group's backlog to decline to approximately $16.3 billion. While lower, this healthy backlog continues to keep us in an 18- to 24-month delivery window for our G450 and G550 products, and G650 backlog remains approximately 5 years in duration. As I've mentioned previously, because new orders for the G650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we do not expect new orders to match planned deliveries the near term.
Through the first half, orders reflect the relative resilience of the large-cabin market when compared with mid-cabin. North American customers comprised 60% of the order book year-to-date, reflecting the return of some of our North American customers and some cooling of international demand, particularly in Asia. Gulfstream flying hours were at prerecession levels, pretty healthy, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Bellstream and Jet Aviation services are up almost 5%. We continue to work diligently to ensure that our service network remains well-positioned to serve customers in the growing install global fleet.
In pursuit of this goal, we continue to improve our Field and Airborne Support Teams, our FAST teams. These teams, which were created a decade ago to provide 24/7 customer service support, just celebrated their 3,000 mission flight. In the quarter, we announced the addition of mobile maintenance vehicles to the FAST capability set. These vehicles will provide a range of services to customers in targeted markets.
Preowned aircraft on the market continued to slowly decline in the quarter. We had 1 aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this quarter, took 1 additional preowned in trade during the quarter and had both aircraft available for sale at quarter end.
On the product development front, the G650 and G280 development programs continued to make progress in the second quarter. Both aircraft set city-pair records en route to EBACE in Geneva in May. The G280 has now completed all of its FAA flying and we're working through the final stages of certification. We are nearly complete with the FAA's required G650 flight testing and remain on track to obtain a third quarter type certification.
We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering about 24 green G650 aircraft this year and around 17 completions with most of these completions happening in the fourth quarter.
For the year, I expect the group sales to grow approximately 15% in line with my prior guidance, as large- and mid-cabin in-production green deliveries plan for the year remain on track at just over 100 and 10 to 15, respectively. Margins will be in the mid-15% range, somewhat higher than previously expected given Gulfstream's strong performance through the first half.
In summary, General Dynamics executed very well this quarter and I expect that performance to continue in the second half. However, given first half results and the difficult reality of forecasting for IS&T in this uncertain period, I'm adjusting my EPS range to $7 to $7.10. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital.
We have a lot of work to accomplish in the second half as we deal with the defense uncertainties before us, achieve G650 and G280 type certification and begin detailed planning for 2013. With these tasks ahead, Phebe Novakovic, who, as you know, will assume my role as Chairman and CEO at the beginning of next year, is concentrating her efforts on the operation of this corporation and our 2013 planning process. 
Amidst this decidedly dynamic business climate, all of us at General Dynamics remain laser-focused on the things we can control and on doing what we do best: executing.
And with that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

First, net interest expense was $37 million for the quarter versus $31 million in 2011. For 2012, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million, reflecting the full year impact of our fixed rate notes issued in July of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $1 billion of net debt. 
Second, I'd like to point out an item impacting the comparability of our results, that being the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $38 million or about $0.07 in other income. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 31.5% for the first 6 months compared with 30.8% for the same period in 2011.
For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 amount, but due primarily to the absence of the R&D tax credit for 2012 but also due to less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower.
Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the question-and-answer."

We believe the second-half order activity will be stronger, as I said in my remarks. Example, let me just talk to demographics: 60% of our first quarter -- our first-half orders came from North America. Within that set, we had several, shall we say, multi-aircraft fleet buys, if you will, that moved out of the quarter; not off the page, just out of the quarter. And we anticipate those to be with us in the order book before the end of the year. And really, that probably had as much to do with North America with the order circumstance, if you will, as anything. So last year, just to further comment on North America, last year, at the midyear, about 28% as I recall, of our orders were North American. And as I said before, 60% this year. So the North American market, at large, is becoming a bigger part of our order book, which we like a lot. Conversely, we saw great softness in Europe, not unexpected by anyone and some in Asia, which frankly, we attribute at this stage more to timing than anything. What does that mean? That means, this year -- I don't have the exact percentage in my head, but last year's midyear order book was like 49% Asia Pacific and this year it was down in the high teens, as I recall. So there has been some cooling, as I said in my remarks. But again, we had a lot of fleet activity last year that hasn't manifested itself yet this year, but because of ongoing discussions, et cetera, we have -- we believe that there will be more activity coming out of Asia in the second half is probably the cleanest way to say it."

The 650 certification, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're getting very close to completion of the flight test activity. That'll conclude here very shortly. Once that occurs, then it becomes a matter of putting it all together, my word, not probably the proper word, administratively, if you will, in laying all that out and then getting with -- working with the FAA to get yourself to an agreed-upon time to execute the type certification. We're on track for that. I have no indication that we're not. So I'm getting excited about it actually. I try to throttle myself back, but that's on track. Once that happens and as that happens, okay, once the flying's done, then we'll -- they'll start training the crews for the aircraft to be delivered, et cetera, as we had talked before. And you'll see then entry into service within a matter, I should think, of weeks after the type certification occurs. So we're marching down that time line very aggressively and visibly, I would add. They're doing lots of flying right now, but we're almost done with it. The service business, Howard, I mentioned, I think, the service business was up like up 5% for the first half. I would expect it to probably stay kind of flat for the rest of the year. I don't -- and why do I say that? Because the lack of activity, for example, that we're seeing in Europe right now, I don't see that getting any better for the rest of the year. It's causing us to have to reshape our European business somewhat at Jet, as I mentioned earlier. So the service business is doing fine, but I don't expect it to outperform the first half in the second half. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised on that, but I just don't see it right now. And we measure that in lots of different ways, not the least of which is looking at what visibility our service centers have on their order books and it's still pretty close aboard. Not a lot of long-term appointments for discretionary repair and upgrade. So it's still a very strong business for us, but I don't see much more than flat for the rest of the year."

When you look at the ops tempo, clearly the Navy is small for the missions being asked of it. You've got the Navy stretched thin over Central Command and at the same time being asked to cover significant areas in the Pacific Command. The pivot to the Pacific has been long in the making, but I don't think anyone foresaw how much the Navy would be tasked over Central Command. So it's clear that the Navy budget faces real strain in terms of the needs for more ships. And I'm just wondering if you could give us color on what kind of discussions you're having with your Navy as they wrangle with solving this problem. Is there kind of examination into, basically, maybe buying more lower-cost surface combatants? Or the Virginia-class sub was supposed to be a low-cost sub; could they downsize yet again and develop less costly subs? Can you maybe add some vibrancy to kind of how you're working with the customer kind of wrestle with this?"

Over 90% of the world's commerce moves by sea, by volume, as I recall. I don't think that will change, certainly not anytime soon. And with that as a reality, United States Navy must maintain a robust force structure. That robust force structure must include lots of ships. And as I've said before, presence really does make a difference, and so you have to be there particularly when you're dealing now with the realities in the Pacific where the tyranny of distance causes you to be unable to be in multiple places at the same time very easily. So all that bodes well when you're a Navy shipbuilder for your future opportunities. As to your comment about the Virginia-class, the Virginia-class submarine in that program, itself, is what I would call as close to a model program as the Department of Defense has and we're very proud of that and we bring those boats in at the price tag that was -- I think, the public price tag is like $2 billion a boat. In point of fact, we delivered the Mississippi $60 million under budget and a year early, so we know how to build Virginia-class submarines. There is no substitute for the Virginia-class submarine in my humble opinion, and I don't think the Navy would argue with that. We need them in number, that's why Block IV will become a reality and there'll probably be a Block V after that. So the customer is looking at costs all the time on things like SSBN(X), but we still must have a fleet of major platforms. LCS will have its role, but we're still going to be making -- manufacturing lots of, in Jay Johnson's humble opinion and I think the Navy would agree, lots of major surface combatants, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines and the auxiliaries that will be needed to service them around the globe.

General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing opera",3588,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing operations. And I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013. We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with 4 bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our 3 defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multiyear Gulfstream campus investment project continues. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Orders in this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion, while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog in the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts stood at $77.5 billion. 
Let me briefly address what we are experiencing in today's Aerospace and defense environment. Defense bottom line upfront. There's been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year and we are closer to the fiscal cliff. The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year continue to impact our customers behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle businesses where bids awaiting awards are at record levels and descoping actions are becoming much more common practice. We are likely to see more of this in the fourth quarter. We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next 2 months as this election cycle ends and the Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country. 
In light of the significant legislative workload, in the limited time line however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration will be resolved before January. With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year end has escalated in recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect in 2013.
With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our government customer continues to assert that there is no -- there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing sequestration should be it triggered. The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for the defense, as well as other federal agencies. Given the lack of planning to date however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer and thus, our entire industry. We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate further defense cuts.
In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizable large cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several multi-aircraft orders from North American customers, which we had originally expected in the second quarter materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia, and political uncertainty here and abroad, continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing for all the factors I just explained is difficult to predict.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T sales were $2.5 billion in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter. Sales through the first half of 2012 as in 2011 reflected continued pressure in our tactical communications business. In the third quarter however, tactical communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 program awards improved and development program contract awards, including JTRS and WIN-T progressed. Volume at our IT service business on the other hand was somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favored price over experience and product quality.
The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $200 million -- $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedize computing equipment inventory at our tactical communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus on less volatile lower margin commoditize products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities. Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%. This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift towards service work, an altered mix in lower level of tactical communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer contracts.
Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter in 2 years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion. Award activity was particularly notable in our tactical communications and IT Service businesses.
Several of the awards received are long-awaited and exemplify the customers continuing focus on network modernization. These included a $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network WIN-T Increment 2 capability and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios. Awards in our IT Service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support capabilities to existing customers across the federal government. Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release.
IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, increased $1 billion to over $32 billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year-over-year and sequentially. We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with 2 acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority areas. 
Open kernel LAVs, now a part of our tactical communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that enable the secure separation of corporate data from a users personal data stored on the same device. The technology has wide range and commercial and government applications, as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs through Bring Your Own Device policy. In Fidelis security systems, now a part of our industry-leading cyber business, offers highly regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing proprietary information. Fidelis' product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow. 
Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the tactical communications and IT services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed work award activity added to backlog in the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from our previous guidance. Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be around 9%. 
Next, combat systems. Combat systems' third quarter sales totaled nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing 4 military Light Armored Vehicles sales and growing combat vehicle volume, offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European vehicles work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the group's volume in the quarter was somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter.
The group's earnings were $274 million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across combat's portfolio of domestic businesses. Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures, driven by delays in international awards, which reflect the group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impacts from lower-than-anticipated volume. ELS is aggressively going after cost and has already reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous facilities around Europe and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives. Total backlog for combat systems was $9.4 billion at the and of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50 million to provide additional facts vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank. 
Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including tank upgrades for Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and Light Armored Vehicles for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizable 8-year Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the Army customer's long-term commitment to improving the tank's capability.
For its current planning documents, the Army envisions incorporating Abrams improvements arising from this R&D contract in the 2017 time frame. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process with all 4 committees adding tank manufacturing funding to the President's budget request.
Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon and in turn, our Army customer to solidify the size and shape of the future force. We remain confident however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms. The Stryker double-V hull is an excellent example of GDP leveraging our experience to bring cost-efficient solutions to the customer. The life-saving benefit of the double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months. However, prior to the customer second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform flat bottom Strykers into the double-V hull configuration. I'm pleased to say that the very first double-V hull exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion vehicles is running on time and budget, and we have decisively established the double-V hull exchange program's value proposition, creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost.
The army is currently analyzing the benefits of this program and working towards solidifying additional double-V hull requirements in conjunction with broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to date, we anticipate an additional conversion orders. Similarly, our combat systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our Army and Marine Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force.
GD's focus on bringing affordable solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation defense operations this quarter. Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost efficiently produce high-precision parts on core franchise programs such as the hydro rocket, and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high-performance wellness programs. 
Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their largest volume in the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and development programs accelerate and our mature domestic vehicle production works flows. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margin. 
Now I'll discuss Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were relatively stable when compared with the prior-year period as destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume grows and the T8KE program winds down. The group's repair-related sales increased primarily due to the third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2012 also enhanced the group's repair sales. Earl provides General Dynamics and role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-shift multi-option contracts, and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE, which will see delivery of the 14 and final ship this week. 
I also want to highlight the performance across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to raft of the entire structure of the first MLP. Construction of these first of class shift is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery plan for the second quarter of 2013. At that iron works, progress continues on zoom well, the first DDG1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a most impressive sight on BIW's waterproof front. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG 51 restart ships are also underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce 2 different types of destroyers in our main shipyard.
Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter, while total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valid the total repair bill for the submarine at several million dollars, and we anticipate additional repair work following the planning activities. 
Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year-ago period when Marine Systems booked 3 destroyers and several substantive engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy nature of Marine's contract activity were Shipbuilding awards common large trenches provide several years of backlog.
We expect several of the sizable awards next year, including the Navy said DDG 51 multi-year program and the Black 4 Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon include the Ohio replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014. 
Marine Systems' fourth quarter volumes will be lower than the previous 3, as the T-AKE program concludes, while margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range.
Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement of FAA type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period due to higher green G650 deliveries, while earnings were $261 million. Margins were 14.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter-to-quarter and therefore, can distort profitability comparisons. Profitability was also modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter, as the business works aggressively to confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis which is impacting aircraft utilization and service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward. 
In the completions business, the jet team recently delivered the fourth narrowbody wide-body aircraft of the year and added another narrowbody to the order book. Jet service operations are seeing mixed demand, with pockets of strength in some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at jet is working aggressively to address this dynamic situation by optimizing our maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on the rightsizing facility situated in slower markets and investing in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets.
Gulfstream reported its best quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand, driven by political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis of global economic sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy, and we continue to expect to solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months, as I previously mentioned.
Customer defaults in the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8x, reflecting improved overall award activity, offset by continued G650 deliveries. The group's backlog at quarter end stood at just over $16 billion, including approximately 5 years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter.
In terms of preowned, Gulfstream took 2 aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered 1 aircraft at breakeven and brokered another 1 for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 preowned aircraft in inventory. Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels of getting the third quarter, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream #1 ranking in worldwide product support. 
In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the 10th consecutive year in the Annual Aviation International News Product Support Survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly Professional Pilot Survey. To meet growing customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network, including plans to open new company-owned service centers in Brazil and China.
Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely, as we deliver new G650s and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest, following tight certification, and we are proud to showcase them of the NBAA convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together, these aircraft have already amassed 6 city records, including 1 transatlantic record each is a testament not only to the capabilities of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team. Entry into service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparation to support EIS are proceeding at pace, including retrofit work and pilot training. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including entry into service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24, G650s, that's really unchanged, 80, 450s and 550s, that's up modestly, and 15 to 20, mid-cap and aircraft, that', too, is up modestly. Planned completion deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remained unchanged, while g650 completions will be somewhat lower than the 17 originally planned solely as a function of the later-than-anticipated type certification. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior guidance and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range. 
In summary, General Dynamics made progress in several important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7 to $7.05. However, sequestration is resolved, all of us at General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability, with primary emphasis on nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven solutions. 
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

Based on our current net debt position of $900 million, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year. Next, the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the first 9 months compared with 30.6% for the same period of 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate at 31.4% due to the less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower and the exploration of the R&D tax credit here in the U.S. 
Finally, during the quarter, we contributed approximately $321 million to our pension plans. To date, this year, we contributed approximately $430 million to our plans, with full year funding expectation of $500 million.

The ECP 1, as it is called, which I alluded to in my remarks, the long-term Abrams R&D contract was very important to lock down, if you will, the long view on the Abrams. So we'll be working that on the engineering development side as we approach the 2017 time frame. But indeed, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012 budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out at least another year. That's kind of -- so are we taking it a year at a time in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sidelining to the 2017 longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months, okay? In addition to that, and recall I believe we've talked about this before, but we have international work that also will reside at that facility with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, and we've got the Israel Markova Halls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we got a number of international programs that work through that facility as well. So our view is that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very functional for as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain that it is about General Dynamics. With the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose. So that, I think, perhaps answers the tank. The Vangent beneficiary call center, I believe I'm correct here and Amy nods her head, this will take place now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute by the contract recompete will be at some point in 2013, which is a change that pushed it out, but we continue to work since we're the incumbent."

So how that force shapes itself will have impact on combat quite obviously. So domestically it comes down to Stryker, which we talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about. It comes down to ground combat vehicles. It comes down to AMPV replacement, things like that, that will -- were an integral part of either competing for or are already doing all those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined. We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker we've got work to do, but we're very encouraged by the exchange program of the double-Vs as I mentioned in my remarks. And we're fairly confident that they're going to continue converting, we will converting continue converting flat bottoms to double-Vs. But the long-term opportunity of the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next 6 to 8 months. As we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013. The international space, though is really significant business for us. And it as you've heard me say before, the projections their increased that as a part of combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, Light Armored Vehicles and those are the 2 primary movers, no pun intended, but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV program, there are significant opportunities there for us going forward. So combat is going to have, as I mentioned before, we're integral to the force.

That's off the top of my head, George. Your R&D question, it's interesting. If I look at the stream of R&D at Gulfstream across the year, it sounds like the way I described the backlog at the Marine group. It's very lumpy, and that's exactly what this is. And, by the way, it just happens that the year-ago quarter and the sequential quarter, were the lumpiest. What can I do? That's just the way it hit. And almost by a factor of like 3.5 or 4 to 1. So that really is it. I mean the margin impact derives -- there's a little bit, as I think as I said in my remarks, that you could attribute to jet absorption costs. And some for liquidated damages, but that's in the noise quite honestly. It really is in the R&D and purely a function of the comparators."

Within that, I should add, consistent with our earlier comments I've made, that the Fortune 500 as part of that is back, which is I think very good for everyone. We are seeing internationally, if you look at the whole backlog, backlog large, it's still about 60% international, okay. I was talking about 2012's inject into that. 60% international, but it's fair to say that we're seeing not surprisingly less activity in Europe and less activity in Asia Pacific, believing that to be, frankly, I think tied to things like the government transition in China and just some slowness and bringing orders to the 4. We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming months. So the dialogue in the interest level is still there. It's the translation into orders that's not occurring. And as I think maybe we mentioned in the last call, there's also in the financing world, there seems to be more of a requirement if you're going to finance your aircraft that you have to get the financing locked in before you order the aircraft, which wasn't the case in earlier times.

But in point of fact, within that, you recall, earlier discussions, we talk about the mix within IS&T and the service mix has increased from my memory thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20s back some couple 3 years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So there's a margin reality that's attached to that. By the way, our IS&T folks in that space have been done a tremendous job of executing a good profitability. But that's a reality that is there, okay, there's more service work. The tactical communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now, not all of a sudden, we're finally getting the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products and more on more moderate margin things. But we do have the franchise programs in there. WIN-T and JTRS have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and within the next year we'll build even further. So we're very encouraged for that, and that will be significant business going forward for C4 systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics. So we've had -- we've seen award delays, I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lowest rise technically acceptable, which is, Jay Johnson's opinion, not very hopeful to anybody in the long-term, and then we've seen increased competition. So those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term view for IS&T, for us, is a very healthy one there just a short cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where we are in the world right now dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next 6 months."

General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing operations. And I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013. 
We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with 4 bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our 3 defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multi-year Gulfstream campus investment project continues. 
Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Orders this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion; while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog in the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts, stood at $77.5 billion. 
Let me briefly address what we're experiencing in today's aerospace and defense environment. Defense bottom line upfront. There's been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year and we are closer to the fiscal cliff. The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year continued to impact our customers behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle businesses where bids awaiting awards are at record levels and descoping actions are becoming much more common practice. We are likely to see more of this in the fourth quarter. We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next 2 months as this election cycle ends and the Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country. 
In light of the significant legislative workload, in the limited lame-duck timeline however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration will be resolved before January. With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year end has escalated in recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect in 2013.
With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our government customer continues to assert that there is no -- there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing sequestration, should it be triggered. The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for Defense, as well as other federal agencies. Given the lack of planning to date however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer and thus, our entire industry. We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate further defense cuts.
In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizable large cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several multi-aircraft orders from North American customers, which we had originally expected in the second quarter, materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods, however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia, and political uncertainty here and abroad continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing for all the factors I just explained is difficult to predict.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T sales were $2.5 billion in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter. Sales through the first half of 2012 as in 2011 reflected continued pressure in our tactical communications business. 
In the third quarter, however, tactical communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 program awards improved and development program contract awards, including JTRS and WIN-T, progressed. 
Volume at our IT service business on the other hand was somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favor price over experience and product quality.
The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $200 million -- $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedized computing equipment inventory at our tactical communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus on -- less on volatile lower margin commoditized products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities. Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%. This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift towards service work, an altered mix and lower level of tactical communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer contracts.
Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter in 2 years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion. Award activity was particularly notable in our tactical communications and IT service businesses.
Several of the awards received are long awaited and exemplify the customers' continuing focus on network modernization. These included a $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network, WIN-T Increment 2 capability and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3,700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios. 
Awards in our IT service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support capabilities to existing customers across the federal government. Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release.
IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, increased $1 billion to over $32 billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year-over-year and sequentially. We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with 2 acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority areas. 
Open Kernel Labs, now a part of our tactical communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that enable the secure separation of corporate data from a user's personal data stored on the same device. This technology has wide range in commercial and government applications, as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs through bring-your-own-device policies. And Fidelis Security Systems, now a part of our industry-leading cyber business, offers highly-regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing proprietary information. Fidelis's product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow. 
Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the tactical communications and IT services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed award activity added to backlog in the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from my previous guidance. Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be around 9%. 
Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems' third quarter sales totaled nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing foreign military Light Armored Vehicles sales and growing combat vehicle volume, offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European vehicle work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the group's volume in the quarter was somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter.
The group's earnings were $274 million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across combat's portfolio of domestic businesses. Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures driven by delays in international awards, which reflect the group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impacts from lower-than-anticipated volume. 
ELS is aggressively going after cost and has already reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous facilities around Europe, and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems was $9.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50 million to provide additional Foxhound vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank. 
Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including tank upgrades for Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and Light Armored Vehicles for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizable 8-year Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the army customer's long-term commitment to improving the tank's capability.
For its current planning documents, the army envisions incorporating Abrams improvements arising from this R&D contract in the 2017 time frame. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process with all 4 committees adding tank manufacturing funding to the president's budget request.
Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon and in turn, our army customer to solidify the size and shape of the future force. We remain confident however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms. 
The Stryker Double-V Hull is an excellent example of GD leveraging our experience to bring cost-efficient solutions to the customer. The life-saving benefit of the double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months. However, prior to the customer's second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform flat bottom Strykers into the double-V hull configuration. 
I'm pleased to say that the very first double-V hull exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion vehicles is running on time and budget, and we have decisively established the double-V hull exchange program's value proposition, creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost.
The army is currently analyzing the benefits of this program and working towards solidifying additional double-V hull requirements in conjunction with broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to date, we anticipate an additional conversion orders. 
Similarly, our Combat Systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our army and Marine Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force.
GD's focus on bringing affordable solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation's defense operations this quarter. Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost-efficiently produce high-precision parts on core franchise programs such as the hydro rocket, and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high-performance weapons programs. 
Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their largest volume of the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and development programs accelerate, and our mature domestic vehicle production works flows. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margins. 
Now I'll discuss Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were relatively stable when compared with the prior-year period as destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume grows, and the T-AKE Program winds down. 
The group's repair-related sales increased primarily due to the third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2012, also enhanced the group's repair sales. Earl provides General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option, MSMO, contracts, and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE Program, which will see delivery of the 14th and final ship this week. 
I also want to highlight that performance across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to erect the entire structure of the first MLP. Construction of this first-of-class ship is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery plan for the second quarter of 2013. 
At Bath Iron Works, progress continues on Zumwalt, the first DDG 1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a most impressive sight on BIW's waterfront. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG 51 restart ships are also underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce 2 different types of destroyers in our main shipyard.
Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter, while total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options, was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valued the total repair bill for their submarine at several million dollars, and we anticipate additional repair work following the planning activities. 
Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year-ago period when Marine Systems booked 3 destroyers and several substantive engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy nature of Marine's award contract activity, where shipbuilding awards come periodically in large tranches and provide several years of backlog.
We expect several of these sizable awards next year, including the Navy's DDG 51 multi-year program and the Block IV Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon include the Ohio replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014. 
Marine Systems' fourth quarter volumes will be lower than the previous 3 as the T-AKE Program concludes, while margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range.
Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement of FAA type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period due to higher green G650 deliveries, while earnings were $261 million. Margins were 14.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter-to-quarter and therefore, can distort profitability comparisons. Profitability was also modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter, as the business works aggressively to confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis, which is impacting aircraft utilization and service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward. 
In the completions business, the jet team recently delivered the fourth narrow-body, wide-body aircraft of the year and added another narrow-body to the order book. Jet service operations are seeing mixed demand, with pockets of strength in some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at Jet is working aggressively to address this dynamic situation by optimizing our maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on rightsizing facility situated in slower markets and investing in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets.
Gulfstream reported its best order quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand, driven by political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis on global economic sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy, and we continue to expect to solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months, as I previously mentioned.
Customer defaults in the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8x, reflecting improved overall award activity, offset by continued G650 deliveries. The group's backlog at quarter end stood at just over $16 billion, including approximately 5 years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter.
In terms of preowned, Gulfstream took 2 aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered 1 aircraft at breakeven and brokered another 1 for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 preowned aircraft in inventory. Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels again in the third quarter, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream's #1 ranking in worldwide product support. 
In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the 10th consecutive year in the Annual Aviation International News' Product Support Survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly professional pilot survey. To meet growing customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network, including plans to open new company-owned service centers in Brazil and China.
Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely as we deliver new G650s and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest, following type certification, and we are proud to showcase them at the NBAA convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together, these aircraft have already amassed 6 city pair records, including one transatlantic record each, is a testament not only to the capabilities of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team. Entry into service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparations to support EIS are proceeding apace, including retrofit work and pilot training. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including entry-into-service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24 G650s, that's really unchanged; 80 450s and 550s, that's up modestly; and 15 to 20 mid-cabin aircraft, that's, too, is up modestly. Planned completion deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remain unchanged, while G650 completions will be somewhat lower than the 17 originally planned solely as a function of the later-than-anticipated type certification. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior guidance, and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range. 
In summary, General Dynamics made progress on several important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7 to $7.05. However, sequestration is resolved, all of us at General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability, with primary emphasis on nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven solutions. 
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

Next, the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the first 9 months compared with 30.6% for the same period of 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate at 31.4% due to the less income from international locations, where the tax rates are lower, and the exploration of the R&D tax credit here in the U.S. 
Finally, during the quarter, we contributed approximately $321 million to our pension plans. To date, this year, we have contributed approximately $430 million to our plans, with full year funding expectation of $500 million.

So we'll be working that on the engineering development side as we approach the 2017 time frame. But in the interim, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012 budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out, at least, another year. That's kind of -- so are we taking it a year at a time in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sidelining to the 2017 longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months, okay? In addition to that, and recall I believe we've talked about this before, but we have international work that also will reside at that facility with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, and we've got the Israel Namer Merkava hulls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we've got a number of international programs that work through that facility as well. So our view is that, that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very functional for, as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain than it is about General Dynamics with the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose. So that, I think, perhaps answers the tank. The Vangent beneficiary call center, I believe I'm correct here, and Amy nods her head, that this will take place now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute, but the contract recompete will be at some point in 2013, which is a change. They pushed it out, but we continue to work since we're the incumbent."

We've got -- we know domestically, and I mentioned this in my remarks, what's the size and shape of the force ultimately going to be as things get re-cocked here as a function of the Afghanistan return and the reshape based on sequestration or no, and all of these things get sorted out. So how that force shapes itself will have impact on combat quite obviously. So domestically, it comes down to the Stryker, which we talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about, it comes down to ground combat vehicle. It comes down to AMPV replacements, things like that, that will -- were an integral part of either competing for or are already doing all of those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined. We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker, we've got work to do, but we're very encouraged by the exchange program of the double-Vs, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we're fairly confident that they're going to continue converting -- we will continue converting flat bottoms to double-Vs. But the long-term opportunity on the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next 6 to 8 months as we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013. The international space, though is really significant business for us. And as you've heard me say before, the projections there increased that as a part of combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, Light Armored Vehicles -- and those are the 2 primary movers, no pun intended, but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV program, there's significant opportunities there for us going forward. So combat's is going to have, as I mentioned before, we're integral to the force. We'll stay integral to the force. Exactly how that shapes itself will be determined, I think, in the coming months and year."

And almost by a factor of like 3.5 or 4:1. So it just -- that really is it.

I was talking about 2012's inject into that. 60% international, but it's fair to say that we're seeing not surprisingly less activity in Europe and less activity in Asia Pacific believing that to be, frankly, I think, tied to things like the government transition in China and just some slowness in bringing orders to the fore. We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming months. So the dialogue and the interest level is still there. It's the translation into orders that's not occurring. And as I think, maybe we mentioned in the last call, there's also -- in the financing world, there seems to be more of a requirement if you're going to finance your aircraft that you have to get the financing locked in before you order the aircraft, which wasn't the case in earlier times.

We've got -- the most impact we're seeing right now is in the short cycle businesses, a.k.a. IS&T. That's a blinding flash of the obvious. But in point of fact, within that, you recall earlier discussions, we talked about the mix within IS&T, and the service mix has increased from, my memory thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20s back some couple 3 years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So there's a margin reality that's attached to that. By the way, our IS&T folks in that space have done a tremendous job of executing at good profitability. But that's a reality that's there, okay? There's more service work. The tactical communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now, all of a -- not all of a sudden, we're finally getting the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products and more on more moderate margin things. But we do have the franchise programs in there. WIN-T and JTRS, which have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and within the next year, we'll build even further. So we're very encouraged for that, and that will be significant business going forward for C4 Systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics. So we've had -- we've seen award delays, I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lowest price technically acceptable, which is, in Jay Johnson's opinion, not very helpful to anybody in the long term, but -- and then we've seen increased competition. So those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term view for IS&T, for us, is a very healthy one there, just a short-cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where we are in the world right now dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next 6 months."

General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing operations. And I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter.
In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013. 
We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with 4 bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our 3 defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multi-year Gulfstream campus investment project continues. 
Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Orders this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion; while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog in the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts, stood at $77.5 billion. 
Let me briefly address what we're experiencing in today's aerospace and defense environment. Defense bottom line upfront. There's been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year and we are closer to the fiscal cliff. The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year continued to impact our customers' behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle businesses where bids awaiting awards are at record levels and descoping actions are becoming much more common practice. We are likely to see more of this in the fourth quarter. We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next 2 months as this election cycle ends and the Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country. 
In light of the significant legislative workload, in the limited lame-duck timeline however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration will be resolved before January. With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year end has escalated in recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect in 2013.
With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our government customer continues to assert that there is no -- there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing sequestration, should it be triggered. The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for Defense, as well as other federal agencies. Given the lack of planning to date however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer and thus, our entire industry. We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate further defense cuts.
In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizable large cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several multi-aircraft orders from North American customers, which we had originally expected in the second quarter, materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods, however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia, and political uncertainty here and abroad continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing for all the factors I just explained is difficult to predict.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T sales were $2.5 billion in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter. Sales through the first half of 2012 as in 2011 reflected continued pressure in our tactical communications business. 
In the third quarter, however, tactical communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 program awards improved and development program contract awards, including JTRS and WIN-T, progressed. 
Volume at our IT service business on the other hand was somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favor price over experience and product quality.
The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $200 million -- $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedized computing equipment inventory at our tactical communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus on -- less on volatile lower margin commoditized products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities. Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%. This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift towards service work, an altered mix and lower level of tactical communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer contracts.
Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter in 2 years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion. Award activity was particularly notable in our tactical communications and IT service businesses.
Several of the awards received are long awaited and exemplify the customers' continuing focus on network modernization. These included a $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network, WIN-T Increment 2 capability, and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3,700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios. 
Awards in our IT service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support capabilities to existing customers across the federal government. Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release.
IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, increased $1 billion to over $32 billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year-over-year and sequentially. We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with 2 acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority areas. 
Open Kernel Labs, now a part of our tactical communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that enable the secure separation of corporate data from a user's personal data stored on the same device. This technology has wide range in commercial and government applications, as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs through bring-your-own-device policies. And Fidelis Security Systems, now a part of our industry-leading cyber business, offers highly-regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing proprietary information. Fidelis's product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow. 
Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the tactical communications and IT services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed award activity added to backlog in the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from my previous guidance. Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be around 9%. 
Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems' third quarter sales totaled nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing foreign military Light Armored Vehicles sales and ground combat vehicle volume, offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European vehicle work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the group's volume in the quarter was somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter.
The group's earnings were $274 million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across combat's portfolio of domestic businesses. Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures driven by delays in international awards, which reflect the group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impacts from lower-than-anticipated volume. 
ELS is aggressively going after cost and has already reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous facilities around Europe, and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems was $9.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50 million to provide additional Foxhound vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank. 
Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including tank upgrades for Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and Light Armored Vehicles for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizable 8-year Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the army customer's long-term commitment to improving the tank's capabilities.
For its current planning documents, the Army envisions incorporating Abrams improvements arising from this R&D contract in the 2017 time frame. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process with all 4 committees adding tank manufacturing funding to the president's budget request.
Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon, and in turn our army customer, to solidify the size and shape of the future force. We remain confident, however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms. 
The Stryker Double-V Hull is an excellent example of GD leveraging our experience to bring cost-efficient solutions to the customer. The life-saving benefit of the double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months. However, prior to the customer's second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform flat bottom Strykers into the double-V hull configuration. 
I'm pleased to say that the very first double-V hull exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion vehicles is running on time and budget, and we have decisively established the double-V hull exchange program's value proposition, creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost.
The Army is currently analyzing the benefits of this program and working towards solidifying additional double-V hull requirements in conjunction with broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to date, we anticipate additional conversion orders. 
Similarly, our Combat Systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our Army and Marine Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force.
GD's focus on bringing affordable solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation's defense operations this quarter. Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost-efficiently produce high-precision parts on core franchise programs such as the hydro rocket, and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high-performance weapons programs. 
Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their largest volume of the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and development programs accelerate, and our mature domestic vehicle production work slows. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margins. 
Now I'll discuss Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were relatively stable when compared with the prior-year period as destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume grows, and the T-AKE Program winds down. 
The group's repair-related sales increased primarily due to the third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2012, also enhanced the group's repair sales. Earl provides General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option, MSMO, contracts, and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE Program, which will see delivery of the 14th and final ship this week. 
I also want to highlight that performance across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to erect the entire structure of the first MLP. Construction of this first-of-class ship is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery plan for the second quarter of 2013. 
At Bath Iron Works, progress continues on Zumwalt, the first DDG 1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a most impressive sight on BIW's waterfront. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG 51 restart ships are also underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce 2 different types of destroyers in our main shipyard.
Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter, while total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options, was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valued the total repair bill for their submarine at several hundred million dollars, and we anticipate additional repair work following the planning activities. 
Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year-ago period when Marine Systems booked 3 destroyers and several substantive engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy nature of Marine's award contract activity, where shipbuilding awards come periodically in large tranches and provide several years of backlog.
We expect several of these sizable awards next year, including the Navy's DDG 51 multi-year program and the Block IV Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon include the Ohio replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014. 
Marine Systems' fourth quarter volumes will be lower than the previous 3 as the T-AKE Program concludes, while margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range.
Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement of FAA type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period due to higher green G650 deliveries, while earnings were $261 million. Margins were 14.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter-to-quarter and, therefore, can distort profitability comparisons. Profitability was also modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter, as the business works aggressively to confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis, which is impacting aircraft utilization and service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward. 
In the completions business, the jet team recently delivered the fourth narrow-body, wide-body aircraft of the year and added another narrow-body to the order book. Jet service operations are seeing mixed demand, with pockets of strength in some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at Jet is working aggressively to address this dynamic situation by optimizing our maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on rightsizing facility situated in slower markets and investing in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets.
Gulfstream reported its best order quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand, driven by political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis on global economic sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy, and we continue to expect to solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months, as I previously mentioned.
Customer defaults in the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8x, reflecting improved overall award activity, offset by continued G650 deliveries. The group's backlog at quarter end stood at just over $16 billion, including approximately 5 years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter.
In terms of preowned, Gulfstream took 2 aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered 1 aircraft at breakeven and brokered another 1 for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 preowned aircraft in inventory. Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels        again in the third quarter, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream's #1 ranking in worldwide product support. 
In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the 10th consecutive year in the Annual Aviation International News' Product Support Survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly professional pilot survey. To meet growing customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network, including plans to open new company-owned service centers in Brazil and China.
Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely as we deliver new G650s and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest, following type certification, and we are proud to showcase them at the NBAA convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together, these aircraft have already amassed 6 city pair records, including one transatlantic record each, is a testament not only to the capabilities of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team. Entry into service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparations to support EIS are proceeding apace, including retrofit work and pilot training. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including entry-into-service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24 G650s, that's really unchanged; 80 450s and 550s, that's up modestly; and 15 to 20 mid-cabin aircraft, that's, too, is up modestly. Planned completion deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remain unchanged, while G650 completions will be somewhat lower than the 17 originally planned solely as a function of the later-than-anticipated type certification. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior guidance, and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range. 
In summary, General Dynamics made progress on several important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7 to $7.05. However sequestration is resolved, all of us at General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability, with primary emphasis on nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven solutions. 
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate at 31.4% due to the less income from international locations, where the tax rates are lower, and the exploration of the R&D tax credit here in the U.S.

They weren't -- they were priced right when they come to market. You got to take them if you want to build that business, and that's exactly what we did in all 4 cases. So it's setting them up for longer-term opportunities, and we felt that was appropriate."

So we'll be working that on the engineering development side as we approach the 2017 time frame. But in the interim, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012 budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out, at least, another year. That's kind of -- so are we taking it a year at a time in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sight-lining to the 2017 longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months, okay? In addition to that, and recall I believe we've talked about this before, but we have international work that also will reside at that facility with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, and we've got the Israel Namer Merkava hulls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we've got a number of international programs that work through that facility as well. So our view is that, that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very functional for, as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain than it is about General Dynamics with the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose. So that, I think, perhaps answers the tank. The Vangent beneficiary call center, I believe I'm correct here, and Amy nods her head, that this will take place now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute, but the contract recompete will be at some point in 2013, which is a change. They pushed it out, but we continue to work since we're the incumbent."

We've got -- we know domestically, and I mentioned this in my remarks, what's the size and shape of the force ultimately going to be as things get re-cocked here as a function of the Afghanistan return and the reshape based on sequestration or no, and all of these things get sorted out. So how that force shapes itself will have impact on Combat quite obviously. So domestically, it comes down to the Stryker, which we talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about. It comes down to ground combat vehicle. It comes down to AMPV replacements, things like that, that will -- were an integral part of either competing for or are already doing all of those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined. We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker, we've got work to do, but we're very encouraged by the exchange program of the double-Vs, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we're fairly confident that they're going to continue converting -- we will continue converting flat bottoms to double-Vs. But the long-term opportunity on the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next 6 to 8 months as we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013. The international space, though, is really significant business for us. And as you've heard me say before, the projections there increased that as a part of combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, Light Armored Vehicles -- and those are the 2 primary movers, no pun intended, but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV program, there's significant opportunities there for us going forward. So combat's going to have, as I mentioned before, we're integral to the force. We'll stay integral to the force.

We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming months. So the dialogue and the interest level is still there. It's the translation into orders that's not occurring.

The top line impact of all of that, I think, been reflected in our results over the last year or so. So I don't see any strategic shift other than what I've just described there."

We've got -- the most impact we're seeing right now is in the short cycle businesses, a.k.a. IS&T. That's a blinding flash of the obvious. But in point of fact, within that, you recall earlier discussions, we talked about the mix within IS&T, and the service mix has increased from, my memory thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20s back some couple 3 years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So there's a margin reality that's attached to that. Oh, by the way, our IS&T folks in that space have done a tremendous job of executing at good profitability. But that's a reality that's there, okay? There's more service work. The tactical communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now, all of a -- not all of a sudden, we're finally getting the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products and more on more moderate margin things. But we do have the franchise programs in there. WIN-T and JTRS, which have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and, within the next year, will build even further. So we're very encouraged for that, and that will be significant business going forward for C4 Systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics. So we've had -- we've seen award delays, I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lowest price technically acceptable, which is, in Jay Johnson's opinion, not very helpful to anybody in the long term, but -- and then we've seen increased competition. So those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term view for IS&T, for us, is a very healthy one. They are just a short-cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where we are in the world right now, dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next 6 months."
