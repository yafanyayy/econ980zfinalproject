We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results. For the first quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sale",1628,"Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone, from Austin, Texas. We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results. For the first quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $667,000 translating to near record sales per square foot of $929, 9.1% store contribution, 5.6% operating margin and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement, 8.3% EBITDA margin at 28% increase of diluted earnings per share to $0.65, and 12.6% NOPAT return on invested capital.
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $340 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $261 million in cash flow from operations and $80 million in proceeds from 2 member stock option exercises. 
We invested $111 million in new and existing stores, returned $18 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $4 million of common stock. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by $209 million to just over $1 billion a company milestone.
Turning to sales, given increasingly tougher comparisons and slightly moderating inflation, we are particularly pleased to deliver our ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating 2-year comps, which were 17.7% for the quarter. Our sales momentum continues to be broad based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comped at 6%, with strong transaction count increases of over 4%. 
We're pleased to see increases in transaction count back over 6%, reflecting our ability both to attract new customers and to retain our loyal core customers. With the moderation in inflation, the breakout between our transaction and basket size increases was back to the 80/20 mix we were reporting prior to the sharp increase inflation and the backup with year. 
Our core customer spend on average posted 3x more than you customers. So as the increase in our average transaction count accelerated and inflation moderated in Q1, we saw the increase in our average basket size moderate as well to 2%. We were able to selectively pass through product cost increases while customers continued to trade up, resulting in higher average price per item which drove an increase in our basket size.  This was offset slightly by a decrease in items per transaction. 
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their purchases towards organic products, higher-priced tiers and several discretionary categories. We are seeing nice growth in our $25 to $50 dollar basket and also continue to see strong increases in the $50 plus size baskets. 
Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 10 basis points to 34.7% of sales driven by an improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Similar to our results in the fourth quarter, we did not see cost of goods leverage as we remain focused on balancing rising product costs with maintaining our relative value positioning to drive sales over the long term. 
During the holidays, it was important to get the center of the plate in order to get the rest of the holiday meal, so we were very sensitive to maintaining the right price levels in our meat departments despite sharp cost increases in beef. Inflation isn't going away, but we believe the moderation will give us additional flexibility to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis, within our historical range of 34% to 35% while maintaining our sales momentum. 
Turning to new store growth during the first quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Fulsome, California, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Minnetonka, Minnesota, Yonkers, New York and our first stores in Oklahoma City and Scotland. Our new stores continue to generate a lot of excitement. In Fulsome, we had 1,000 customers waiting for our doors to open with some even camping out the night before him, our first. Fulsome is about 20 miles outside of Sacramento and is one of the areas of the country that was hit fairly hard by the housing collapse. It's a good example of the success we are seeing with our broader real estate approach in our ability to go into some of the smaller, more suburban markets. In many cases, these markets offer less competition, allowing our differentiated store experience to stand out even more in the marketplace than it does in some of the larger market competitive markets. The Economic case is compelling because ramp is significantly less, and with the smaller size, our capital spend is less as well 
We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader strategy. Our new stores showed strong year-over-year improvement in operating performance in the first quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 17% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $561,000 translating to 29% higher sales per square foot at $776. These new stores produced about 450 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class.
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked #32 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be one of only 13 companies ran consecutively since the list was first published in 1998, validates our commitment to our core value of Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence. 
We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Fortune ranking, videos from the new stores, including our gift opening of Scotland featuring the Red Hot Chili Pipers and more. 
Since our fourth quarter earnings release, we have signed a new leases averaging 32,000 square feet in size in Frisco, Colorado, Miami Florida, Orland Park Illinois, South Bend, Indiana, Minneapolis Minnesota, Jackson, Mississippi, Worchester New York and Cleveland Ohio. Prisco, South Bend and Jackson are all new markets for us. We have signed 34 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 30 new stores in fiscal 2013.  We currently have 69 stores or 2.4 million square feet in development equal to 20% of our 12 million square feet in operation. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012, which was a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.
In the first quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q1 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our operating margin to 5.9% and diluted EPS range to 228 to 232 for fiscal 2012. Does imply 6% operating margin and EPS of $1.63 to $1.67 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. We also slightly raised the low end of our sales comp and ident store sales for ranges. We're seeing our sales momentum carry into Q2 with a 9.4% or 18.1% on a 2 year basis. These are obviously great numbers, but keep in mind this is just a 3-week period and the last year's results were impacted by severe winter weather so several of the regions had much easier year-ago comparisons.  In addition, we do expect inflation to continue to moderate from here.
As currently reflected in Street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drives stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. We would like to point out that last year's Q2 and Q3 results were very strong, particularly the gross margin improvement. We expect our year-over-year improvement in gross margin for the remainder of the year to be more in line with the results we produced in the last 2 quarters. 
In addition, our year-over-year EPS growth in Q1 was driven in large part by lower direct store expenses and while we hope that trend will continue, certain expenses like health care costs are always difficult to predict. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, our raised outlook reflects a healthy 17% to 19% increase in operating profits for the remainder of the year on the 11% to 13% increase in total sales. However, the EPS increase is less due primarily to the year-over-year change in our tax rate and share count.
In summary, it's great to start the year off on such a high note. There are some positive things happening on the economic front which we are hopeful will continue. We have tremendous sales momentum as well as the capital and expense disciplines took place in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line. We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the strong performance of our new stores. The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share to further differentiating our shopping experience, reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store and maintaining our relative value positioning.
Before we turn the call over for G&A -- for Q&A, excuse me, we would like to congratulate Michael Disanso on his upcoming retirement, and thank him for 17 years of outstanding leadership. Michael has served as a regional Vice President and Regional President, and most recently as our Senior Global Vice President of Purchasing, Distribution and Communications in addition to leading our Green Mission task force. Having worked in the natural products industry for 41 years, Mike was one of the most knowledgeable, natural and organic foods pioneers, and his wisdom and compassion will be greatly missed. 
We will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you very much."

Again, we have this mission driven, purpose driven trying to fulfill our mission selling really high-quality natural organic foods. We want to do that as inextensively as we can. And I think what's happened is, is the markets come our way. It's people are more interested. A higher percentage of Americans are interested in eating healthier food and people complain about food prices but of course the facts are that Americans are spending less money on food today than any time in our history. We're down 8% of our income on food. So it's really a question of people's priorities and where they want to spend their money. And increasingly, what we're seeing is, is that a higher percentage of the American population is interested in eating healthier and the baby-boom generation continues to age, which works in our favor. And we also see the millennial generation, we have a lot of people on their 20s now who grew up eating Whole Foods Market. That's a natural store they go to. So it's a continuous shift in our direction. And it's not like we've got a 25% market share of the food industry in America.

We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results. For the first quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $667,000, translating to near-record sales per square foot of $929; 9.1% store contribution; 5.6% operating margin and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 8.3% EBITDA margin; a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.65; and 12.6% NOPAT return on invested capital.
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $340 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $261 million in cash flow from operations and $80 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $111 million in new and existing stores, returned $18 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $4 million of common stock. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by $209 million to just over $1 billion, a company milestone.
Turning to sales. Given increasingly tougher comparisons and slightly moderating inflation, we are particularly pleased to deliver our ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating 2-year comps, which were 17.7% for the quarter. Our sales momentum continues to be broad based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comped at 6%, with strong transaction count increases of over 4%.
We're pleased to see increases in transaction count back over 6%, reflecting our ability both to attract new customers and to retain our loyal core customers. With the moderation in inflation, the breakout between our transaction and basket size increases was back to the 80-20 mix we were reporting prior to the sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year.
Our core customer spend on average close to 3x more than new customers, so as the increase in our average transaction count accelerated and inflation moderated in Q1, we saw the increase in our average basket size moderate, as well, to 2%. We were able to selectively pass through product cost increases while customers continued to trade up, resulting in an average, higher average price per item, which drove an increase in our basket size. This was offset slightly by a decrease in items per transaction.
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their purchases towards organic products, higher-priced tiers and several discretionary categories. We are seeing nice growths in our $25 to $50 dollar basket and also continue to see strong increases in the $50-plus-sized baskets.
Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 10 basis points to 34.7% of sales driven by an improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Similar to our results in the fourth quarter, we did not see cost of goods leverage as we remain focused on balancing rising product costs with maintaining our relative value positioning to drive sales over the long term.
During the holidays, it was important to get the center of the plate in order to get the rest of the holiday meal so we were very sensitive to maintaining the right price levels in our meat departments despite sharp cost increases in beef. Inflation isn't going away, but we believe that moderation will give us additional flexibility to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35% while maintaining our sales momentum.
Turning to new store growth. During the first quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Folsom, California; Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Minnetonka, Minnesota; Yonkers, New York; and our first stores in Oklahoma City and in Scotland. Our new stores continue to generate a lot of excitement. In Folsom, we had 1,000 customers waiting for our doors to open, with some even camping out the night before, a first. Folsom is about 20 miles outside of Sacramento and is one of the areas of the country that was hit fairly hard by the housing collapse. It's a good example of the success we are seeing with our broader real estate approach in our ability to go into some of the smaller, more suburban markets. In many cases, these markets offer less competition, allowing our differentiated store experience to stand out even more in the marketplace than it does in some of the large and more competitive markets. The economic case is compelling because ramp is significantly less, and with the smaller size, our capital spend is less, as well. 
We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader strategy. Our new stores showed strong year-over-year improvement in operating performance in the first quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 17% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $561,000, translating to 29% higher sales per square foot at $776. These new stores produced about 450 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class.
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked #32 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be 1 of only 13 companies ranked consecutively since the list was first published in 1998 validates our commitment to our core value of Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence.
We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Fortune ranking; videos from the new stores, including our Giffnock opening of Scotland where we're featuring the Red Hot Chilli Pipers; and more.
Since our fourth quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 33,000 square feet in size in Frisco, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Orland Park, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Jackson, Mississippi; Port Chester, New York; and Cleveland, Ohio. Frisco, South Bend and Jackson are all new markets for us. We have signed 34 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 30 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have 69 stores or 2.4 million square feet in development, equal to 20% of our 12 million square feet in operation.
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012, which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.
In the first quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q1 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our operating margin to 5.9% and diluted EPS range to $2.28 to $2.32 for fiscal 2012. This implies 6% operating margin and EPS of $1.63 to $1.67 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year.
We also slightly raised the low end of our sales comp and ident store sales growth ranges. We are seeing our sales momentum carry into Q2 with a 9.4% comp or 18.1% on a 2-year basis. These are obviously great numbers, but keep in mind this is just a 3-week period and that last year's results were impacted by severe winter weather so several of the regions had much easier year-ago comparisons. In addition, we do expect inflation to continue to moderate from here.
As currently reflected in the Street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drives stronger bottom line results. And then, sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. We would like to point out that last year's Q2 and Q3 results were very strong, particularly the gross margin improvement. We expect our year-over-year improvement in gross margin for the remainder of the year to be more in line with the results we've produced in the last 2 quarters.
In addition, our year-over-year EPS growth in Q1 was driven in large part by lower direct store expenses, and while we hope that trend will continue, certain expenses like health care costs are always difficult to predict. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, our raised outlook reflects a healthy 17% to 19% increase in operating profits for the remainder of the year on the 11% to 13% increase in total sales. However, the EPS increase is less due primarily to a year-over-year change in our tax rate and share count.
In summary, it's great to start the year off on such a high note. There are some positive things happening on the economic front, which we are hopeful will continue. We have tremendous sales momentum as well, as the capital and expense disciplines took place, in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line.
We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit, as evidenced by the strong performance of our new stores.
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store and maintaining our relative value positioning.
Before we turn our call over for G&A -- for Q&A, excuse me, we would like to congratulate Michael Besancon on his upcoming retirement and thank him for 17 years of outstanding leadership. Michael has served as a Regional Vice President, a Regional President and, most recently, as our Senior Global Vice President of Purchasing, Distribution and Communications, in additioning [addition] to leading our Green Mission task force.

We saw that, definitely with the inflation that was happening last year especially towards the end of the year, going and coming out of Q4 into Q1, we're very concerned with customers' reaction to that. So we worked on some very strong promotional programs, we held our pricing in a lot of places and I think that, that reach-out has really had an effective to bring a lot of new customers in. When we go through periods like this, we tend to see a stronger growth in the transaction count and then, usually, the, much more, and then when that happens, the basket size tends to be smaller or at -- levels off because, it doesn't grow as much because the new customers aren't buying as much as the experienced customers do.

And increasingly, what we're seeing is, is that a higher percentage of the American population is interested in eating healthier. And the baby-boom generation continues to age, which works in our favor. And we also see the millennial generation: We have a lot of people in their 20s now who grew up eating in Whole Foods Market, so this is the ""natural"" store they go to.

36602,145848878,217962,"Whole Foods Market, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Whole Foods Market, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone, from Austin, Texas.We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results.

We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results. For the first quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable-store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $667,000, translating to near-record sales per square foot of $929; 9.1% store contribution; 5.6% operating margin and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 8.3% EBITDA margin; a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.65; and 12.6% NOPAT return on invested capital.
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $340 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $261 million in cash flow from operations and $80 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $111 million in new and existing stores, returned $18 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $4 million of common stock. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by $209 million to just over $1 billion, a company milestone.
Turning to sales. Given increasingly tougher comparisons and slightly moderating inflation, we are particularly pleased to deliver our ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating 2-year comps, which were 17.7% for the quarter. Our sales momentum continues to be broad based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comp-ed at 6%, with strong transaction count increases of over 4%.
We're pleased to see increases in transaction count back over 6%, reflecting our ability both to attract new customers and to retain our loyal core customers. With the moderation in inflation, the breakout between our transaction and basket size increases was back to the 80-20 mix we were reporting prior to the sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year.
Our core customer spend on average close to 3x more than new customers, so as the increase in our average transaction count accelerated and inflation moderated in Q1, we saw the increase in our average basket size moderate, as well, to 2%. We were able to selectively pass through product cost increases while customers continued to trade up, resulting in an average to higher average price per item, which drove an increase in our basket size. This was offset slightly by a decrease in items per transaction.
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their purchases towards organic products, higher-priced tiers and several discretionary categories. We are seeing nice growths in our $25 to $50 dollar basket and also continue to see strong increases in the $50-plus-sized baskets.
Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 10 basis points to 34.7% of sales driven by an improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Similar to our results in the fourth quarter, we did not see cost of goods leverage as we remain focused on balancing rising product costs with maintaining our relative value positioning to drive sales over the long term.
During the holidays, it was important to get the center of the plate in order to get the rest of the holiday meal so we were very sensitive to maintaining the right price levels in our meat departments despite sharp cost increases in beef. Inflation isn't going away, but we believe that moderation will give us additional flexibility to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35% while maintaining our sales momentum.
Turning to new store growth. During the first quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Folsom, California; Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Minnetonka, Minnesota; Yonkers, New York; and our first stores in Oklahoma City and in Scotland. Our new stores continue to generate a lot of excitement. In Folsom, we had 1,000 customers waiting for our doors to open, with some even camping out the night before, a first. Folsom is about 20 miles outside of Sacramento and is one of the areas of the country that was hit fairly hard by the housing collapse. It's a good example of the success we are seeing with our broader real estate approach in our ability to go into some of the smaller, more suburban markets. In many cases, these markets offer less competition, allowing our differentiated store experience to stand out even more in the marketplace than it does in some of the larger, more competitive markets. The economic case is compelling because ramp is significantly less, and with the smaller size, our capital spend is less, as well. 
We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader strategy. Our new stores showed strong year-over-year improvement in operating performance in the first quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 17% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $561,000, translating to 29% higher sales per square foot at $776. These new stores produced about 450 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class.
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked #32 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be 1 of only 13 companies ranked consecutively since the list was first published in 1998 validates our commitment to our core value of Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence.
We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Fortune ranking; videos from the new stores, including our Giffnock opening of Scotland where we're featuring the Red Hot Chilli Pipers; and more.
Since our fourth quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 33,000 square feet in size in Frisco, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Orland Park, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Jackson, Mississippi; Port Chester, New York; and Cleveland, Ohio. Frisco, South Bend and Jackson are all new markets for us. We have signed 34 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 30 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have 69 stores or 2.4 million square feet in development, equal to 20% of our 12 million square feet in operation.
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012, which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.
In the first quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q1 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our operating margin to 5.9% and diluted EPS range to $2.28 to $2.32 for fiscal 2012. This implies 6% operating margin and EPS of $1.63 to $1.67 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year.
We also slightly raised the low end of our sales comp and ident store sales growth ranges. We are seeing our sales momentum carry into Q2 with a 9.4% comp or 18.1% on a 2-year basis. These are obviously great numbers, but keep in mind this is just a 3-week period and that last year's results were impacted by severe winter weather so several of the regions had much easier year-ago comparisons. In addition, we do expect inflation to continue to moderate from here.
As currently reflected in the Street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drives stronger bottom line results. And then, sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. We would like to point out that last year's Q2 and Q3 results were very strong, particularly the gross margin improvement. We expect our year-over-year improvement in gross margin for the remainder of the year to be more in line with the results we've produced in the last 2 quarters.
In addition, our year-over-year EPS growth in Q1 was driven in large part by lower direct store expenses, and while we hope that trend will continue, certain expenses like health care costs are always difficult to predict. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, our raised outlook reflects a healthy 17% to 19% increase in operating profits for the remainder of the year on the 11% to 13% increase in total sales. However, the EPS increase is less due primarily to a year-over-year change in our tax rate and share count.
In summary, it's great to start the year off on such a high note. There are some positive things happening on the economic front, which we are hopeful will continue. We have tremendous sales momentum as well, as the capital and expense disciplines took place, in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line.
We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit, as evidenced by the strong performance of our new stores.
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store and maintaining our relative value positioning.
Before we turn our call over for G&A -- for Q&A, excuse me, we would like to congratulate Michael Besancon on his upcoming retirement and thank him for 17 years of outstanding leadership.

So we worked on some very strong promotional programs, we held our pricing in a lot of places and I think that, that reach-out has really had an effective to bring a lot of new customers in. When we go through periods like this, we tend to see a stronger growth in the transaction count and then, usually, the, much more, and then when that happens, the basket size tends to be smaller or at least levels off because, it doesn't grow as much because the new customers aren't buying as much as the experienced customers do.

And we want to do that as inexpensively as we can. And I think what happened is, is the market’s come our way. It's people are more interested. A higher percentage of Americans are interested in eating healthier food. And I mean, people complain about food prices, but of course, the facts are that Americans are spending less money on food today than any other, at any time in our history. We're down to 8% of our income on food. So it's really a question of people's priorities and where they want to spend their money. And increasingly, what we're seeing is, is that a higher percentage of the American population is interested in eating healthier. And the baby-boom generation continues to age, which works in our favor. And we also see the millennial generation: we have a lot of people in their 20s now who grew up eating in Whole Foods Market, so it’s just the natural store they go to. So it's a continuous shift in our direction. And it's not like we've got a 25% market share of the food industry in America. It's a small sliver but it's continuing to grow every month, every quarter, every year. And we anticipate that to continue that way for the foreseeable future."

36602,145848878,219050,"Whole Foods Market, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Whole Foods Market, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone, from Austin, Texas.We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results.

We are very pleased to begin the year delivering another quarter of consistently strong results. For the first quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable-store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $667,000, translating to near-record sales per square foot of $929; 9.1% store contribution; 5.6% operating margin and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 8.3% EBITDA margin; a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.65; and 12.6% NOPAT return on invested capital.
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $340 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $261 million in cash flow from operations and $80 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $111 million in new and existing stores, returned $18 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $4 million of common stock. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by $209 million to just over $1 billion, a company milestone.
Turning to sales. Given increasingly tougher comparisons and slightly moderating inflation, we are particularly pleased to deliver our ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating 2-year comps, which were 17.7% for the quarter. Our sales momentum continues to be broad based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comp-ed at 6%, with strong transaction count increases of over 4%.
We're pleased to see increases in transaction count back over 6%, reflecting our ability both to attract new customers and to retain our loyal core customers. With the moderation in inflation, the breakout between our transaction and basket size increases was back to the 80-20 mix we were reporting prior to the sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year.
Our core customer spend on average close to 3x more than new customers, so as the increase in our average transaction count accelerated and inflation moderated in Q1, we saw the increase in our average basket size moderate, as well, to 2%. We were able to selectively pass through product cost increases while customers continued to trade up, resulting in an average to higher average price per item, which drove an increase in our basket size. This was offset slightly by a decrease in items per transaction.
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their purchases towards organic products, higher-priced tiers and several discretionary categories. We are seeing nice growths in our $25 to $50 dollar basket and also continue to see strong increases in the $50-plus-sized baskets.
Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 10 basis points to 34.7% of sales driven by an improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Similar to our results in the fourth quarter, we did not see cost of goods leverage as we remain focused on balancing rising product costs with maintaining our relative value positioning to drive sales over the long term.
During the holidays, it was important to get the center of the plate in order to get the rest of the holiday meal so we were very sensitive to maintaining the right price levels in our meat departments despite sharp cost increases in beef. Inflation isn't going away, but we believe that moderation will give us additional flexibility to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35% while maintaining our sales momentum.
Turning to new store growth. During the first quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Folsom, California; Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Minnetonka, Minnesota; Yonkers, New York; and our first stores in Oklahoma City and in Scotland. Our new stores continue to generate a lot of excitement. In Folsom, we had 1,000 customers waiting for our doors to open, with some even camping out the night before, a first. Folsom is about 20 miles outside of Sacramento and is one of the areas of the country that was hit fairly hard by the housing collapse. It's a good example of the success we are seeing with our broader real estate approach in our ability to go into some of the smaller, more suburban markets. In many cases, these markets offer less competition, allowing our differentiated store experience to stand out even more in the marketplace than it does in some of the larger, more competitive markets. The economic case is compelling because ramp is significantly less, and with the smaller size, our capital spend is less, as well. 
We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader strategy. Our new stores showed strong year-over-year improvement in operating performance in the first quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 17% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $561,000, translating to 29% higher sales per square foot at $776. These new stores produced about 450 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class.
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked #32 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be 1 of only 13 companies ranked consecutively since the list was first published in 1998 validates our commitment to our core value of Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence.
We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Fortune ranking; videos from the new stores, including our Giffnock opening of Scotland where we're featuring the Red Hot Chilli Pipers; and more.
Since our fourth quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 33,000 square feet in size in Frisco, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Orland Park, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Jackson, Mississippi; Port Chester, New York; and Cleveland, Ohio. Frisco, South Bend and Jackson are all new markets for us. We have signed 34 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 30 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have 69 stores or 2.4 million square feet in development, equal to 20% of our 12 million square feet in operation.
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012, which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.
In the first quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q1 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our operating margin to 5.9% and diluted EPS range to $2.28 to $2.32 for fiscal 2012. This implies 6% operating margin and EPS of $1.63 to $1.67 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year.
We also slightly raised the low end of our sales comp and ident store sales growth ranges. We are seeing our sales momentum carry into Q2 with a 9.4% comp or 18.1% on a 2-year basis. These are obviously great numbers, but keep in mind this is just a 3-week period and that last year's results were impacted by severe winter weather so several of the regions had much easier year-ago comparisons. In addition, we do expect inflation to continue to moderate from here.
As currently reflected in the Street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drives stronger bottom line results. And then, sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. We would like to point out that last year's Q2 and Q3 results were very strong, particularly the gross margin improvement. We expect our year-over-year improvement in gross margin for the remainder of the year to be more in line with the results we've produced in the last 2 quarters.
In addition, our year-over-year EPS growth in Q1 was driven in large part by lower direct store expenses, and while we hope that trend will continue, certain expenses like health care costs are always difficult to predict. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, our raised outlook reflects a healthy 17% to 19% increase in operating profits for the remainder of the year on the 11% to 13% increase in total sales. However, the EPS increase is less due primarily to a year-over-year change in our tax rate and share count.
In summary, it's great to start the year off on such a high note. There are some positive things happening on the economic front, which we are hopeful will continue. We have tremendous sales momentum as well, as the capital and expense disciplines took place, in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line.
We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit, as evidenced by the strong performance of our new stores.
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store and maintaining our relative value positioning.
Before we turn our call over for G&A -- for Q&A, excuse me, we would like to congratulate Michael Besancon on his upcoming retirement and thank him for 17 years of outstanding leadership. Michael has served as a Regional Vice President, a Regional President and, most recently, as our Senior Global Vice President of Purchasing, Distribution and Communications, in additioning to leading our Green Mission task force. Having worked in the natural products industry for 41 years, Mike was one of the most knowledgeable natural and organic foods pioneers, and his wisdom and compassion will be greatly missed.
We will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you very much."

We saw that, definitely with the inflation that was happening last year especially towards the end of the year, going and coming out of Q4 into Q1, we were very concerned with customers' reaction to that. So we worked on some very strong promotional programs, we held our pricing in a lot of places and I think that, that reach-out has really had an effective to bring a lot of new customers in. When we go through periods like this, we tend to see a stronger growth in the transaction count and then, usually, the, much more, and then when that happens, the basket size tends to be smaller or at least levels off because, it doesn't grow as much because the new customers aren't buying as much as the experienced customers do.

We're down to 8% of our income on food. So it's really a question of people's priorities and where they want to spend their money. And increasingly, what we're seeing is, is that a higher percentage of the American population is interested in eating healthier. And the baby-boom generation continues to age, which works in our favor. And we also see the millennial generation: we have a lot of people in their 20s now who grew up eating in Whole Foods Market, so it’s just the natural store they go to.

If we open up a small store -- a smaller store in some other parts of the country, it might be a lot lower. So it really depends on the part of the country. Labor costs are, we have a fairly standard labor rate that we play across the country, but again, certain parts of the country have -- and some of these places we've been going into just kind of have lower overall state taxes and payroll tax and things like that. So we are finding that, in some of the -- some of these new markets we're going into, that the overall operating cost, the taxes, things like that, are lower."

We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, t",1238,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, translating to sales per square foot of $971; gross margin of 36.3%; store contribution of 10.8%; operating margin of 7.1%; EBITDA margin of 9.7%; and return on invested capital of 16.3%. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $413 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $256 million in cash flow from operations and $157 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $102 million in new and existing stores and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by nearly $300 million to $1.3 billion. 
Turning to sales. Given slightly moderating inflation and rising gas prices through much of the quarter, we were very pleased to produce a 3-year stacked ident of over 24%. We are not aware of any public food retailers producing these kinds of results. While not a record, the first quarter of 2008 was the last time we produced 3-year idents this high. Our increase in transaction count accelerated to over 7%, and our sales momentum continues to be broad-based across regions, departments and store age classes. 
Including stores over 15 years old comped at 7%, with healthy transaction count increases of 6%. Our robust sales and outstanding execution, along with moderating inflation, helped to generate exceptional margin performance for the quarter. The 70 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by almost equal improvements in both occupancy cost and cost of goods sold. We have better tools and access to better data, which are resulting in much higher level of sophistication and purchasing, inventory management, particularly shrink control, as well as pricing management and optimization. 
While we're very proud to have produced record margin results this quarter, our longer-term strategy has not changed. And while we have confidence that we can continue to deliver excellent results, we do not consider margins over 35% to be sustainable. We know one of the keys to growing our sales is to improve our relative value positioning over time, so while we might have some quarters that are higher, our goal remains to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35%. 
Turning to new store growth. During the second quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Glen Mills, Pennsylvania; and Lynnwood, Washington. We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader real estate approach and our ability to go into all types of markets. New stores continue to show great year-over-year improvement in operating performance in Q2. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 14% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and producing average weekly sales per store of $576,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $791. These new stores produced about 340 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class. 
In other news, we're proud to announce that as of April 22, Earth Day, we were the first national grocer to stop selling all red-rated seafood, including Atlantic halibut, grey sole and skate. A red rating indicates that a species are suffering from overfishing where the current fishing methods harm other marine life or habitats. Our knowledgeable fishmongers will recommend alternatives such as Marine Stewardship Council-certified specific halibut and yellow-rated Dover sole and Atlantic flounder. We want to thank our suppliers that work closely with us to find high-quality green- and yellow-rated seafood so we can meet the self-imposed deadline one year earlier than scheduled. 
We also wanted to appreciate our shoppers who joined our in-store fundraising efforts to raise more than $5.5 million during Whole Planet Foundation's Prosperity Campaign. The grants to micro-finance partners in the United States and 50 other countries will foundation funds microloans in developing communities where we source our products. To date, the foundation has committed more than $26.5 million and has disbursed more than $16.5 million worldwide. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our seafood ratings, the Whole Planet Foundation and pictures from new stores and much more. 
Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 38,600 square feet in size in Alpharetta, in Savannah, Georgia; Maple Grove, Minnesota; Albany in Brooklyn, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; Toronto, Ontario; and North Burnaby, British Columbia. Savannah and Albany are both new markets for us. We have signed 33 new leases over the last 12 months and on track to open between 24 to 27 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have in development 70 stores totaling 2.5 million square feet, which translates to about 21% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our recent outlook for fiscal year 2012 which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. In the second quarter, we beat street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q2 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our outlook for the fiscal year. Our new identical sales range for the year implies 7% to 8.6% for the remainder of the year. The reflects the possibility of further deceleration of the 2-year ident and the 3-year ident staying around 24%. The high end implies the 2-year ident remains in line with Q2, and the 3-year ident accelerates to over 25%. 
We have raised our expectations for operating margin to 6.3% and diluted earnings per share range to $2.44 to $2.47, which implies earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.18 for the back half of the year. As currently reflected in street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drives stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. 
We estimate the impact of earnings from the extra week in Q4 to be $1 -- I'm sorry, to be $0.06 per share for the fiscal year excluding the impact of the extra week in Q4. We expect EPS growth of 23% to 25% on total sales growth of around 13%. 
In summary, it's great to be in such a positive position where we can confidently raise our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tremendous sales momentum, as well as the capital and expense disciplines in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line. We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the improving performance of our new stores. 
The marketplace remains highly competitive but we believe we will continue to gain market share to further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value positioning and reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end today at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

So that has contributed a lot to why our new stores are performing so well and why we feel that even though we're ramping up the number of new stores are opening this year and next year again, we don't think it's going to have what we used to have that growth paradox where we opened up a lot of new stores where we reduced our profitability because we're opening up these stores like they're somewhat mature stores already. And it's having a really positive effect on us compared to the way things were a few years ago."

We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, t",1242,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, translating to sales per square foot of $971; gross margin of 36.3%; store contribution of 10.8%; operating margin of 7.1%; EBITDA margin of 9.7%; and return on invested capital of 16.3%. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $413 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $256 million in cash flow from operations and $157 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $102 million in new and existing stores and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by nearly $300 million to $1.3 billion. 
Turning to sales, given slightly moderating inflation and rising gas prices through much of the quarter, we were very pleased to produce a 3-year stacked ident of over 24%. We are not aware of any public food retailers producing these kinds of results. And while not a record, the first quarter of 2008 was the last time we produced 3-year idents this high. Our increase in transaction count accelerated to over 7%, and our sales momentum continues to be broad-based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comped at 7%, with healthy transaction count increases of 6%. 
Our robust sales and outstanding execution, along with moderating inflation, helped generate exceptional margin performance for the quarter. The 70 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by almost equal improvements in both occupancy cost and cost of goods sold. We have better tools and access to better data, which are resulting in much higher level of sophistication in purchasing, inventory management, particularly shrink control, as well as pricing management and optimization. 
While we're very proud to have produced record margin results this quarter, our longer-term strategy has not changed. And while we have confidence that we can continue to deliver excellent results, we do not consider margins over 35% to be sustainable. We know one of the keys to growing our sales is to improve our relative value positioning over time, so while we might have some quarters that are higher, our goal remains to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35%. 
Turning to new store growth, during the second quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Glen Mills, Pennsylvania; and Lynnwood, Washington. We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader real estate approach and our ability to go into all types of markets. New stores continue to show great year-over-year improvement in operating performance in Q2. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 14% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and producing average weekly sales per store of $576,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $791. These new stores produced about 340 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class. 
In other news, we're proud to announce that as of April 22, Earth Day, we were the first national grocer to stop selling all red-rated seafood, including Atlantic halibut, grey sole and skate. A red rating indicates that a species are suffering from overfishing or that current fishing methods harm other marine life or habitats. Our knowledgeable fishmongers will recommend alternatives such as Marine Stewardship Council-certified specific halibut and yellow-rated Dover sole and Atlantic flounder. We want to thank our suppliers that work closely with us to find high-quality green- and yellow-rated seafood so we can meet this self-imposed deadline one year earlier than scheduled. 
We also wanted to appreciate our shoppers who joined our in-store fundraising efforts to raise more than $5.5 million during Whole Planet Foundation's Prosperity Campaign. Through grants to microfinance partners in the United States and 50 other countries, Whole Planet Foundation funds microloans in developing communities where we source our products. To date, the foundation has committed more than $26.5 million and has disbursed more than $16.5 million worldwide. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about our seafood ratings, the Whole Planet Foundation and pictures from new stores and much more. 
Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 38,600 square feet in size in Alpharetta and Savannah, Georgia; Maple Grove, Minnesota; Albany and Brooklyn, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; Toronto, Ontario; and North Burnaby, British Columbia. Savannah and Albany are both new markets for us. We have signed 33 new leases over the last 12 months and on track to open between 24 to 27 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have in development 70 stores totaling 2.5 million square feet, which translates to about 21% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012 which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. In the second quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q2 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our outlook for the fiscal year. Our new identical sales range for the year implies 7% to 8.6% for the remainder of the year. The low end reflects the possibility of further deceleration of the 2-year ident and the 3-year ident staying around 24%. The high end implies the 2-year ident remains in line with Q2, and the 3-year ident accelerates to over 25%. 
We have raised our expectations for operating margin to 6.3% and diluted earnings per share range to $2.44 to $2.47, which implies earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.18 for the back half of the year. As currently reflected in Street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. 
We estimate the impact of earnings from the extra week in Q4 to be $1 -- I mean, I'm sorry, to be $0.06 per share for the fiscal year excluding the impact of the extra week in Q4. We expect EPS growth of 23% to 25% on total sales growth of around 13%. 
In summary, it's great to be in such a positive position where we can confidently raise our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tremendous sales momentum, as well as the capital and expense disciplines in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line. We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the improving performance of our new stores. 
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value positioning and reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end today at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

We really are guiding people back to our normal or normal range because we think it's really important as we continue to -- as we continue to find more flexibility in our pricing and we continue to gain through distribution efficiencies and better buying, that the important thing is that we continue to balance having the good strong margin with continued reinvesting in our prices so that we can continue to -- we found really great results as we've been able to bring over time over these years our prices down and really make sure that we're really priced competitively in each market we are.

So we've been able to go in there and have these stores perform at a level -- with a contribution, something that we didn't usually see until a year or 2 later. I mean, we're coming out of the gate with very good contribution in the first year, which is different from what was happening 4 or 5 years ago.

We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, t",1244,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, translating to sales per square foot of $971; gross margin of 36.3%; store contribution of 10.8%; operating margin of 7.1%; EBITDA margin of 9.7%; and return on invested capital of 16.3%. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $413 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $256 million in cash flow from operations and $157 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $102 million in new and existing stores and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by nearly $300 million to $1.3 billion. 
Turning to sales, given slightly moderating inflation and rising gas prices through much of the quarter, we were very pleased to produce a 3-year stacked ident of over 24%. We are not aware of any public food retailers producing these kinds of results. And while not a record, the first quarter of 2008 was the last time we produced 3-year idents this high. Our increase in transaction count accelerated to over 7%, and our sales momentum continues to be broad-based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comped at 7%, with healthy transaction count increases of 6%. 
Our robust sales and outstanding execution, along with moderating inflation, helped generate exceptional margin performance for the quarter. The 70 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by almost equal improvements in both occupancy cost and cost of goods sold. We have better tools and access to better data, which are resulting in much higher level of sophistication in purchasing, inventory management, particularly shrink control, as well as pricing management and optimization. 
While we're very proud to have produced record margin results this quarter, our longer-term strategy has not changed. And while we have confidence that we can continue to deliver excellent results, we do not consider margins over 35% to be sustainable. We know one of the keys to growing our sales is to improve our relative value positioning over time, so while we might have some quarters that are higher, our goal remains to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35%. 
Turning to new store growth, during the second quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Glen Mills, Pennsylvania; and Lynnwood, Washington. We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader real estate approach and our ability to go into all types of markets. New stores continue to show great year-over-year improvement in operating performance in Q2. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 14% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $576,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $791. These new stores produced about 340 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class. 
In other news, we're proud to announce that as of April 22, Earth Day, we were the first national grocer to stop selling all red-rated seafood, including Atlantic halibut, Grey sole and skate. A red rating indicates that a species is suffering from overfishing or that current fishing methods harm other marine life or habitats. Our knowledgeable fishmongers will recommend alternatives such as Marine Stewardship Council-certified Pacific halibut and yellow-rated Dover sole and Atlantic flounder. We want to thank our suppliers that work closely with us to find high-quality green- and yellow-rated seafood so we can meet this self-imposed deadline one year earlier than scheduled. 
We also wanted to appreciate our shoppers who joined our in-store fundraising efforts to raise more than $5.5 million during Whole Planet Foundation's Prosperity Campaign. Through grants to microfinance partners in the United States and 50 other countries, Whole Planet Foundation funds microloans in developing communities where we source our products. To date, the foundation has committed more than $26.5 million and has disbursed more than $16.5 million worldwide. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our seafood ratings, the Whole Planet Foundation and pictures from new stores and much more. 
Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 38,600 square feet in size in Alpharetta and Savannah, Georgia; Maple Grove, Minnesota; Albany and Brooklyn, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; Toronto, Ontario; and North Burnaby, British Columbia. Savannah and Albany are both new markets for us. We have signed 33 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 to 27 new stores in fiscal 2012, and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have in development 70 stores totaling 2.5 million square feet, which translates to about 21% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012 which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. In the second quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q2 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our outlook for the fiscal year. Our new identical sales range for the year implies 7% to 8.6% for the remainder of the year. The low end reflects the possibility of further deceleration of the 2-year ident and the 3-year ident staying around 24%. The high end implies the 2-year ident remains in line with Q2, and the 3-year ident accelerates to over 25%. 
We have raised our expectations for operating margin to 6.3% and diluted earnings per share range to $2.44 to $2.47, which implies earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.18 for the back half of the year. As currently reflected in street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. 
We estimate the impact of earnings from the extra week in Q4 to be $1 -- I mean, I'm sorry, to be $0.06 per share for the fiscal year, excluding the impact of the extra week in Q4. We expect EPS growth of 23% to 25% on total sales growth of around 13%. 
In summary, it's great to be in such a positive position where we can confidently raise our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tremendous sales momentum, as well as the capital and expense disciplines in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line. We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the improving performance of our new stores. 
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value positioning and reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end today at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

We had a -- yes, we had a great quarter from a gross margin standpoint. I say, we've had -- when you have strong sales like we do, like we had in the quarter, really helps with leveraging our expenses down, which we have really good leverage in all of our expenses. And the other thing that happens when we have really strong sales like we've had is that we're able to really cut back on shrink because the product's turning a lot better. And it's also helped us -- helped because we've put a lot of systems in place over the last year to really help with that. As far as going forward, we think that we're -- we feel really confident that we'll have -- continue to have good performance. As we said in the script in our guidance, we don't think we'll regularly be up in this range. We really are guiding people back to our normal, more normal range because we think it's really important as we continue to -- as we continue to find more flexibility in our pricing and we continue to gain through distribution efficiencies and better buying, that the important thing is that we continue to balance having the good strong margin with continued reinvesting in our prices so that we can continue to -- we found really great results as we've been able to bring, over time over these years, our prices down and really make sure that we're really priced competitively in each market we are. And we want to continue to be able to do that. I think it's much more important in the long term to keeping our top line sales growth going than to get too happy and try to get too much in the margin area."

And secondly, even though we're seeing great comps than a lot of our own older, more mature stores, it's also true that a lot of those stores are in percentage rents. So landlords are capturing some of that increase in sales as well. So rents go up when our sales go up. It's not true in all our stores, but definitely it's true in some of them.

But a lot of what's happened is we've gotten very good at estimating -- we've gotten very good at estimating where store sales are going to start, and we've gotten very good at understanding how to staff these stores properly and set the expectations. And in addition to that, a lot of our new stores are opening up with very good, solid sales right from the beginning. So we've been able to go in there and have these stores perform at a level -- with a contribution, something that we didn't usually see until a year or 2 later. I mean, we're coming out of the gate with very good contribution in the first year, which is different from what was happening 4 or 5 years ago. So that has contributed a lot to why our new stores are performing so well and why we feel that even though we're ramping up the number of new stores we're opening this year and next year again, we don't think it's going to have what we used to have, that growth paradox when we opened up a lot of new stores, it would reduce our profitability. Because we're opening up these stores like they're somewhat mature stores already. And it's having a really positive effect on us compared to the way things were a few years ago."

We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, t",1244,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report another consistently strong quarter, producing the best results in our 32-year history. We delivered record results on many levels, including average weekly sales per store of $697,000, translating to sales per square foot of $971; gross margin of 36.3%; store contribution of 10.8%; operating margin of 7.1%; EBITDA margin of 9.7%; and return on invested capital of 16.3%. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $413 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $256 million in cash flow from operations and $157 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $102 million in new and existing stores and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our total cash and investments increased during the quarter by nearly $300 million to $1.3 billion. 
Turning to sales, given slightly moderating inflation and rising gas prices through much of the quarter, we were very pleased to produce a 3-year stacked ident of over 24%. We are not aware of any public food retailers producing these kinds of results. And while not a record, the first quarter of 2008 was the last time we produced 3-year idents this high. Our increase in transaction count accelerated to over 7%, and our sales momentum continues to be broad-based across regions, departments and store age classes. Even stores over 15 years old comped at 7%, with healthy transaction count increases of 6%. 
Our robust sales and outstanding execution, along with moderating inflation, helped generate exceptional margin performance for the quarter. The 70 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by almost equal improvements in both occupancy cost and cost of goods sold. We have better tools and access to better data, which are resulting in much higher level of sophistication in purchasing, inventory management, particularly shrink control, as well as pricing management and optimization. 
While we're very proud to have produced record margin results this quarter, our longer-term strategy has not changed. And while we have confidence that we can continue to deliver excellent results, we do not consider margins over 35% to be sustainable. We know one of the keys to growing our sales is to improve our relative value positioning over time, so while we might have some quarters that are higher, our goal remains to consistently deliver gross margin on an annual basis within our historical range of 34% to 35%. 
Turning to new store growth, during the second quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Glen Mills, Pennsylvania; and Lynnwood, Washington. We believe our new store results are reflecting the success of our broader real estate approach and our ability to go into all types of markets. New stores continue to show great year-over-year improvement in operating performance in Q2. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 14% smaller in size, averaging 38,000 square feet, and produced average weekly sales per store of $576,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $791. These new stores produced about 340 basis points higher store contribution versus last year's class. 
In other news, we're proud to announce that as of April 22, Earth Day, we were the first national grocer to stop selling all red-rated seafood, including Atlantic halibut, Grey sole and skate. A red rating indicates that a species is suffering from overfishing or that current fishing methods harm other marine life or habitats. Our knowledgeable fishmongers will recommend alternatives such as Marine Stewardship Council-certified Pacific halibut and yellow-rated Dover sole and Atlantic flounder. We want to thank our suppliers that work closely with us to find high-quality green- and yellow-rated seafood so we can meet this self-imposed deadline one year earlier than scheduled. 
We also wanted to appreciate our shoppers who joined our in-store fundraising efforts to raise more than $5.5 million during Whole Planet Foundation's Prosperity Campaign. Through grants to microfinance partners in the United States and 50 other countries, Whole Planet Foundation funds microloans in developing communities where we source our products. To date, the foundation has committed more than $26.5 million and has disbursed more than $16.5 million worldwide. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our seafood ratings, the Whole Planet Foundation and pictures from new stores and much more. 
Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 38,600 square feet in size in Alpharetta and Savannah, Georgia; Maple Grove, Minnesota; Albany and Brooklyn, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; Toronto, Ontario; and North Burnaby, British Columbia. Savannah and Albany are both new markets for us. We have signed 33 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 to 27 new stores in fiscal 2012, and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. We currently have in development 70 stores totaling 2.5 million square feet, which translates to about 21% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2012 which is a 53-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. In the second quarter, we beat Street estimates by $0.05. Based on our Q2 results and updated assumptions for the rest of the year, we have raised our outlook for the fiscal year. Our new identical sales range for the year implies 7% to 8.6% for the remainder of the year. The low end reflects the possibility of further deceleration of the 2-year ident and the 3-year ident staying around 24%. The high end implies the 2-year ident remains in line with Q2, and the 3-year ident accelerates to over 25%. 
We have raised our expectations for operating margin to 6.3% and diluted earnings per share range to $2.44 to $2.47, which implies earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.18 for the back half of the year. As currently reflected in street estimates, we typically see higher average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. 
We estimate the impact of earnings from the extra week in Q4 to be $1 -- I mean, I'm sorry, to be $0.06 per share for the fiscal year, excluding the impact of the extra week in Q4. We expect EPS growth of 23% to 25% on total sales growth of around 13%. 
In summary, it's great to be in such a positive position where we can confidently raise our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tremendous sales momentum, as well as the capital and expense disciplines in place to leverage that momentum to the bottom line. We see great opportunities on the real estate front and are focused on continuing to build our new store pipeline. Our broader real estate strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the improving performance of our new stores. 
The marketplace remains highly competitive, but we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value positioning and reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end today at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

A lot of the -- there's a couple of things that are going on. One is that we know that a lot of the new stores we opened up are smaller in size than what we have been opening up before. And we've had favorable rents on a lot of them. But a lot of what's happened is we've gotten very good at estimating -- we've gotten very good at estimating where store sales are going to start, and we've gotten very good at understanding how to staff these stores properly and set the expectations. And in addition to that, a lot of our new stores are opening up with very good, solid sales right from the beginning. So we've been able to go in there and have these stores perform at a level -- with a contribution, something that we didn't usually see until a year or 2 later. I mean, we're coming out of the gate with very good contribution in the first year, which is different from what was happening 4 or 5 years ago. So that has contributed a lot to why our new stores are performing so well and why we feel that even though we're ramping up the number of new stores we're opening this year and next year again, we don't think it's going to have what we used to have, that growth paradox when we opened up a lot of new stores, it would reduce our profitability. Because we're opening up these stores like they're somewhat mature stores already. And it's having a really positive effect on us compared to the way things were a few years ago."

Our Q3 results reflect another quarter of strong sales momentum and outstanding execution. We produced 27% EPS growth on 14% sales growth, delivering significant year-over-year improvement, including a 62 basis point increase in gross margin to 36%, a 57 basis point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.3% of sales, a 119 basis point improvement in store contribution to 10.7% of sales, a 104 basis point increase in operating margin to 6.9%, 94 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin to 9.6% and 192 basis point improvement in return on invested capital to 15.2%. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated close to $300 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $211 million in cash flow from operations and $88 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. 
We invested $13 million in new and existing stores, repurchased $25 million of common stock and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends over shareholders. During the quarter, our total cash and investments increased $154 million to $1.5 billion. 
Turning back to sales. Given the continued moderation in inflation along with some sluggish economic data points, we were very pleased to produce our second consecutive quarter of 24.5% 3-year stacked idents worth 3 years of 8%-plus increases. Excluding the Easter shift, our comps increased 8.9%, and our idents increased 8.6%. Transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store-age classes. 
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have continued to shift their purchases for organic products and several discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus sized baskets. Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped to generate another quarter of exceptional margin performance. A 51 basis point increase in gross margin x LIFO was driven primarily by equal improvements in occupancy costs and cost of goods sold.
Sequentially from Q2, we saw an approximate 30 basis point decrease in gross margin, which we attribute in part to seasonality, as well as some impact from our strategy to improving our relative value positioning by increasing our level of price investments. 
The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum, as well as our most recent competitive survey, which indicates that we are improving our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter. 
Turning now to new store growth. We are very excited to have opened a record 9 new stores in Q3 in Greensboro and Wilmington North Carolina, Kailua, Hawaii, Edina, Minnesota; Wexford, Pennsylvania; Laguna, California, 2 stores here in Austin and a relocation of our SoHo store in London. Greensboro, Wilmington are both new markets for us. Kailua is our second store on Oahu and our third store in Hawaii. We closed our small store in SoHo and opened a new 18,000-square-foot store in Piccadilly that is a great location and tripled the size. And more than 7 years after opening our flagship store in Austin, we now have 2 new stores in our hometown. 
This quarter's opening speak to the breadth and variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. For the last 5 quarters on average, our new store class consists of 21 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $575,000, translating to sales per square foot of $786 and have generated a contribution margin of just under 6%. We expect these outstanding results, combined with our lower average capital investment per store, will drive strong returns over time. Please check out the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about the new stores that we opened during the quarter. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 12 new leases averaging 38,000 square feet in size: Palm Desert, California; Pompano Beach, Florida; Park Ridge, Illinois; Wichita, Kansas; Boston; Columbia, Maryland; Kansas City, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Parsippany, New Jersey; Greenwood, Pennsylvania; Dallas and Houston. 4 of these leases are in new markets. We have signed 37 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open 25 new stores this year, 28 to 32 new stores next year and 33 to 38 new stores in fiscal 2014. We currently have 76 stores in development totaling 2.8 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, and our initial outlook for fiscal year 2013, a 52-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. 
For the first 3 weeks of Q4, idents increased 9.5% or 18.8% on a 2-year basis. While we are pleased with these results, they represent a short period of time and also include some positive impact from the July 4 holiday shift. Our new range for the year and price idents of 7.6% to 8.6% for Q4 or 16% to 17% on a 2-year basis and 24.7% to 25.7% on a 3-year basis. For 2- and 3-year trends, these ranges are in line with our Q2 results on the low end and reflect an acceleration on the high end. 
As currently reflected in street estimates, we typically see high average weekly sales in our second and third quarters which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. Based on our Q3 results and our higher expectations now for the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal '12 outlook for operating margin to 6.4% and our diluted EPS range by $0.05 to $0.07. Our new fiscal year EPS range of $2.51 to $2.52 comprise EPS of $0.59 to $0.60 for Q4. This includes the estimated impact on earnings from the extra week in Q4 of approximately $0.06 per share. 
For the fiscal year, adjusting for the impact of the extra week in Q4, we expect 27% EPS growth on total sales growth of 13% to 14%. For fiscal year 2013, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, we expect comps of 6.5% to 8.5% and EPS of $2.83 to $2.87. 
In summary, in an economic environment that is proving difficult for many retailers, we are thriving. We have opened 19 stores year-to-date and created over 7,000 new jobs throughout the company over the last 12 months. We just reported excellent quarterly results, raised our guidance for the current fiscal year and initiated guidance for next year. For 2013, we expect another year of healthy comp store sales growth, a record 28 to 32 new store openings, continuous operating margin improvement and earnings growth of 16% to 17%. 
Our growth plans are on track with ending square footage expected to accelerate through 2014. We are well positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position -- proposition and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you very much."

I think the whole purpose driven aspects of Whole Foods Market has a strong appeal to the millennial generation. And the boomers, I mean, I think the thing that's driving them to convert is they're aging. And they'd like to stay young and healthy and vital and extend the longevity so that's a natural push for them. And then adjusting the millennials line up well with our philosophy and our focus-driven aspects for a company but just a little bit tougher sell.

So but what we really have been focused on and what's been very exciting for us is this pick up in customer count. And the thing you've got to remember is that, and I've seen this through the years, is that we'll go through periods where that ratio changes. Sometimes, our customer count will get really strong, and you've got to realize that when new customers come in, they often don't buy as much as existing customers. So if time we have a very strong customer increase, we'll have a relatively low or flat basket size. And then usually, it will cycle on itself sometime the next year, where we'll see those customers mature and start buying more and that ratio will change.

Our Q3 results reflect another quarter of strong sales momentum and outstanding execution. We produced 27% EPS growth on 14% sales growth, delivering significant year-over-year improvement, including a 62-basis-point increase in gross margin to 36%, a 57-basis-point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.3% of sales, a 119-basis-point improvement in store contribution to 10.7% of sales, a 104-basis-point increase in operating margin to 6.9%, 94-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin to 9.6% and 192-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to 15.2%. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated close to $300 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $211 million in cash flow from operations and $88 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. 
We invested $13 million in new and existing stores, repurchased $25 million of common stock and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. During the quarter, our total cash and investments increased $154 million to $1.5 billion. 
Turning back to sales, given the continued moderation in inflation along with some sluggish economic data points, we were very pleased to produce our second consecutive quarter of 24.5% 3-year stacked idents or 3 years of 8%-plus increases. Excluding the Easter shift, our comps increased 8.9%, and our idents increased 8.6%. Transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. 
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have continued to shift their purchases for organic products and several discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus sized baskets. 
Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped to generate another quarter of exceptional margin performance. A 51-basis-point increase in gross margin x LIFO was driven primarily by equal improvements in occupancy costs and cost of goods sold.
Sequentially from Q2, we saw an approximate 30 basis point decrease in gross margin, which we attribute in part to seasonality, as well as some impact from our strategy of improving our relative value positioning by increasing our level of price investments. The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum, as well as our most recent competitive survey, which indicates that we are improving our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter. 
Turning now to new store growth. We are very excited to have opened a record 9 new stores in Q3 in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina; Kailua, Hawaii, Edina, Minnesota; Wexford, Pennsylvania; Laguna Niguel, California; 2 stores here in Austin and a relocation of our Soho store in London. Greensboro and Wilmington are both new markets for us. Kailua is our second store on Oahu and our third store in Hawaii. We closed our small store in Soho and opened a new 18,000-square-foot store in Piccadilly that is a great location and triple the size. And more than 7 years after opening our flagship store in Austin, we now have 2 new stores in our hometown. 
This quarter's openings speak to the breadth and the variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. For the last 5 quarters on average, our new store class has consisted of 21 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $575,000, translating to sales per square foot of $786 and have generated a contribution margin of just under 6%. We expect these outstanding results, combined with our lower average capital investment per store, will drive strong returns over time. Please check out the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about the new stores that we opened during the quarter. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 12 new leases averaging 38,000 square feet in size: Palm Desert, California; Pompano Beach, Florida; Park Ridge, Illinois; Wichita, Kansas; Boston; Columbia, Maryland; Kansas City, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Parsippany, New Jersey; Greenwood, Pennsylvania; Dallas; and Houston. Four of these leases are in new markets. We have signed 37 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open 25 new stores this year, 28 to 30 new store -- 28 to 32 new stores next year and 33 to 38 new stores in fiscal 2014. We currently have 76 stores in development totaling 2.8 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, and our initial outlook for fiscal year 2013, a 52-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. 
For the first 3 weeks of Q4, idents increased 9.5% or 18.8%, on a 2-year basis. While we are pleased with these results, they represent a short period of time and also include some positive impact from the July 4 holiday shift. Our new range for the year implies idents of 7.6% to 8.6% for Q4 or 16% to 17% on a 2-year basis and 24.7% to 25.7% on a 3-year basis. For 2 and 3-year trends, these ranges are in line with our Q3 results on the low end and reflect an acceleration on the high end. 
As currently reflected in Street estimates, we typically see high average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. Based on our Q3 results and our higher expectations now for the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal '12 outlook for operating margin to 6.4% and our diluted EPS range by $0.05 to $0.07. Our new fiscal year EPS range of $2.51 to $2.52 comprise EPS of $0.59 to $0.60 for Q4. This includes the estimated impact on earnings from the extra week in Q4 of approximately $0.06 per share. 
For the fiscal year, adjusting for the impact of the extra week in Q4, we expect 27% EPS growth on total sales growth of 13% to 14%. For fiscal year 2013, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, we expect comps of 6.5% to 8.5% and EPS of $2.83 to $2.87. 
In summary, in an economic environment that is proving difficult for many retailers, we are thriving. We have opened 19 stores year-to-date and created over 7,000 new jobs throughout the company over the last 12 months. We just reported excellent quarterly results, raised our guidance for the current fiscal year and initiated guidance for next year. For 2013, we expect another year of healthy comp store sales growth, a record 28 to 32 new store openings, continuous operating margin improvement and earnings growth of 16% to 17%. 
Our growth plans are on track with ending square footage expected to accelerate through 2014. We are well positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position -- proposition and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. And our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you very much."

So I mean, we have plenty of Gen X customers, but we seem to do better with boomers and millennials. And we don't exactly know why that is. We can speculate on it somewhat that the millennials, a lot of them grew up eating Whole Foods because their parents began it. So they're already familiar with natural organic food. So it's not as big a transition for them. I think the whole purpose-driven aspects of Whole Foods Market, it has a strong appeal to the millennial generation. And the boomers, I mean, I think the thing that's driving them to convert is they're aging. And they'd like to stay young and healthy and vital and extend their longevity, so that's a natural push for them. And then adjusting to millennials line up well with our philosophy and our purpose-driven aspects for our company. But the X-ers may be just a little bit tougher sell. And hey, the X-ers are younger than the boomers, but I don't think they've been able to repeal the aging process. So we think as they age as well, they will begin to turn more to Whole Foods as well.

What we've been seeing is we've been seeing a moderate increase in basket size. A lot of it has come from slightly higher prices. Generally, we've had -- depending on really the market, we've seen -- it's kind of flipped back and forth. We'll see a slight increase in the number of items in the basket and a slight decrease in as prices inflation is going down. And then sometimes we'll see some areas will see a little uptick in the average price of the item and baskets relatively flat. But what we really have been focused on and what's been very exciting for us is this pickup in customer count. And the thing you've got to remember is that, and I've seen this through the years, is that we'll go through periods where that ratio changes. Sometimes, our customer count will get really strong, and you've got to realize that when new customers come in, they often don't buy as much as existing customers. So if at a time when we have a very strong customer count increase, we'll have a relatively low or flat basket size. And then usually, it will cycle on itself sometime the next year, where we'll see those customers mature and start buying more and that ratio will change. So I've never really worried much about what that ratio is. What I really look at is I'm always more excited when we have a lot more customers coming in. I get nervous when our basket size is going up and our customer count is increasing less. So to me, it's not something that I'd really worry on. We look at it. We analyze it, but it seems to balance itself out over time."

Our Q3 results reflect another quarter of strong sales momentum and outstanding execution. We produced 27% EPS growth on 14% sales growth, delivering significant year-over-year improvement, including a 62-basis-point increase in gross margin to 36%, a 57-basis-point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.3% of sales, a 119-basis-point improvement in store contribution to 10.7% of sales, a 104-basis-point increase in operating margin to 6.9%, 94-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin to 9.6% and 192-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to 15.2%. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated close to $300 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $211 million in cash flow from operations and $88 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. 
We invested $13 million in new and existing stores, repurchased $25 million of common stock and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. During the quarter, our total cash and investments increased $154 million to $1.5 billion. 
Turning back to sales, given the continued moderation in inflation along with some sluggish economic data points, we were very pleased to produce our second consecutive quarter of 24.5% 3-year stacked idents or 3 years of 8%-plus increases. Excluding the Easter shift, our comps increased 8.9%, and our idents increased 8.6%. Transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. 
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have continued to shift their purchases toward organic products and several discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus sized baskets. 
Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped to generate another quarter of exceptional margin performance. A 51-basis-point increase in gross margin x LIFO was driven primarily by equal improvements in occupancy costs and cost of goods sold.
Sequentially from Q2, we saw an approximate 30 basis point decrease in gross margin, which we attribute in part to seasonality, as well as some impact from our strategy of improving our relative value positioning by increasing our level of price investments. The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum, as well as our most recent competitive survey, which indicates that we are improving our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter. 
Turning now to new store growth. We are very excited to have opened a record 9 new stores in Q3 in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina; Kailua, Hawaii, Edina, Minnesota; Wexford, Pennsylvania; Laguna Niguel, California; 2 stores here in Austin and a relocation of our Soho store in London. Greensboro and Wilmington are both new markets for us. Kailua is our second store on Oahu and our third store in Hawaii. We closed our small store in Soho and opened a new 18,000-square-foot store in Piccadilly that is a great location and triple the size. And more than 7 years after opening our flagship store in Austin, we now have 2 new stores in our hometown. 
This quarter's openings speak to the breadth and the variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. For the last 5 quarters on average, our new store class has consisted of 21 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $575,000, translating to sales per square foot of $786 and have generated a contribution margin of just under 6%. We expect these outstanding results, combined with our lower average capital investment per store, will drive strong returns over time. Please check out the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about the new stores that we opened during the quarter. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 12 new leases averaging 38,000 square feet in size: Palm Desert, California; Pompano Beach, Florida; Park Ridge, Illinois; Wichita, Kansas; Boston; Columbia, Maryland; Kansas City, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Parsippany, New Jersey; Greenwood, Pennsylvania; Dallas; and Houston. Four of these leases are in new markets. We have signed 37 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open 25 new stores this year, 28 to 30 new store -- 28 to 32 new stores next year and 33 to 38 new stores in fiscal 2014. We currently have 76 stores in development totaling 2.8 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, and our initial outlook for fiscal year 2013, a 52-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. 
For the first 3 weeks of Q4, idents increased 9.5% or 18.8%, on a 2-year basis. While we are pleased with these results, they represent a short period of time and also include some positive impact from the July 4 holiday shift. Our new range for the year implies idents of 7.6% to 8.6% for Q4 or 16% to 17% on a 2-year basis and 24.7% to 25.7% on a 3-year basis. For 2 and 3-year trends, these ranges are in line with our Q3 results on the low end and reflect an acceleration on the high end. 
As currently reflected in Street [ph] estimates, we typically see high average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. Based on our Q3 results and our higher expectations now for the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal '12 outlook for operating margin to 6.4% and our diluted EPS range by $0.05 to $0.07. Our new fiscal year EPS range of $2.51 to $2.52 implies EPS of $0.59 to $0.60 for Q4. This includes the estimated impact on earnings from the extra week in Q4 of approximately $0.06 per share. 
For the fiscal year, adjusting for the impact of the extra week in Q4, we expect 27% EPS growth on total sales growth of 13% to 14%. For fiscal year 2013, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, we expect comps of 6.5% to 8.5% and EPS of $2.83 to $2.87. 
In summary, in an economic environment that is proving difficult for many retailers, we are thriving. We have opened 19 stores year-to-date and created over 7,000 new jobs throughout the company over the last 12 months. We just reported excellent quarterly results, raised our guidance for the current fiscal year and initiated guidance for next year. For 2013, we expect another year of healthy comp store sales growth, a record 28 to 32 new store openings, continuous operating margin improvement and earnings growth of 16% to 17%. 
Our growth plans are on track with ending square footage expected to accelerate through 2014. We are well positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position -- proposition and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. And our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you very much."

So I mean, we have plenty of Gen X customers, but we seem to do better with boomers and millennials. And we don't exactly know why that is. We can speculate on it somewhat that the millennials, a lot of them grew up eating Whole Foods because their parents began it. So they're already familiar with natural organic food. So it's not as big a transition for them. I think the whole purpose-driven aspects of Whole Foods Market has a strong appeal to the millennial generation. And the boomers, I mean, I think the thing that's driving them to convert is they're aging. And they'd like to stay young and healthy and vital and extend their longevity, so that's a natural push for them. And then I just think the millennials line up well with our philosophy and our purpose-driven aspects for our company. But the X-ers may be just a little bit tougher sell. And hey, the X-ers are younger than the boomers, but I don't think they've been able to repeal the aging process. So we think as they age as well, they will begin to turn more to Whole Foods as well.

What we've been seeing is we've been seeing a moderate increase in basket size. A lot of it has come from slightly higher prices. Generally, we've had -- depending on really the market, we've seen -- it's kind of flipped back and forth. We'll see a slight increase in the number of items in the basket and a slight decrease in -- especially as inflation is going down. And then sometimes we'll see some areas will see a little uptick in the average price of the item and baskets relatively flat. But what we really have been focused on and what's been very exciting for us is this pickup in customer count. And the thing you've got to remember is that, and I've seen this through the years, is that we'll go through periods where that ratio changes. Sometimes, our customer count will get really strong, and you've got to realize that when new customers come in, they often don't buy as much as existing customers. So in a time when we have a very strong customer count increase, we'll have a relatively low or flat basket size. And then usually, it will cycle on itself sometime the next year, where we'll see those customers mature and start buying more and that ratio will change. So I've never really worried much about what that ratio is. What I really look at is I'm always more excited when we have a lot more customers coming in. I get nervous when our basket size is going up and our customer count is increasing less. So to me, it's not something that I'd really worry on. We look at it. We analyze it, but it seems to balance itself out over time."

Our Q3 results reflect another quarter of strong sales momentum and outstanding execution. We produced 27% EPS growth on 14% sales growth, delivering significant year-over-year improvement, including a 62-b",1237,"Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon, everybody. Our Q3 results reflect another quarter of strong sales momentum and outstanding execution. We produced 27% EPS growth on 14% sales growth, delivering significant year-over-year improvement, including a 62-basis-point increase in gross margin to 36%, a 57-basis-point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.3% of sales, a 119-basis-point improvement in store contribution to 10.7% of sales, a 104-basis-point increase in operating margin to 6.9%, 94-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin to 9.6% and 192-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to 15.2%. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated close to $300 million of cash during the quarter through a combination of $211 million in cash flow from operations and $88 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. 
We invested $13 million in new and existing stores, repurchased $25 million of common stock and returned $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. During the quarter, our total cash and investments increased $154 million to $1.5 billion. 
Turning back to sales, given the continued moderation in inflation along with some sluggish economic data points, we were very pleased to produce our second consecutive quarter of 24.5% 3-year stacked idents or 3 years of 8%-plus increases. Excluding the Easter shift, our comps increased 8.9%, and our idents increased 8.6%. Transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. 
On a year-over-year basis, our customers have continued to shift their purchases toward organic products and several discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus sized baskets. 
Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped to generate another quarter of exceptional margin performance. A 51-basis-point increase in gross margin x LIFO was driven primarily by equal improvements in occupancy costs and cost of goods sold.
Sequentially from Q2, we saw an approximate 30 basis point decrease in gross margin, which we attribute in part to seasonality, as well as some impact from our strategy of improving our relative value positioning by increasing our level of price investments. The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum, as well as our most recent competitive survey, which indicates that we are improving our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter. 
Turning now to new store growth. We are very excited to have opened a record 9 new stores in Q3 in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina; Kailua, Hawaii, Edina, Minnesota; Wexford, Pennsylvania; Laguna Niguel, California; 2 stores here in Austin and a relocation of our Soho store in London. Greensboro and Wilmington are both new markets for us. Kailua is our second store on Oahu and our third store in Hawaii. We closed our small store in Soho and opened a new 18,000-square-foot store in Piccadilly that is a great location and triple the size. And more than 7 years after opening our flagship store in Austin, we now have 2 new stores in our hometown. 
This quarter's openings speak to the breadth and the variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. For the last 5 quarters on average, our new store class has consisted of 21 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $575,000, translating to sales per square foot of $786 and have generated a contribution margin of just under 6%. We expect these outstanding results, combined with our lower average capital investment per store, will drive strong returns over time. Please check out the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about the new stores that we opened during the quarter. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 12 new leases averaging 38,000 square feet in size: Palm Desert, California; Pompano Beach, Florida; Park Ridge, Illinois; Wichita, Kansas; Boston; Columbia, Maryland; Kansas City, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Parsippany, New Jersey; Greenwood, Pennsylvania; Dallas; and Houston. Four of these leases are in new markets. We have signed 37 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open 25 new stores this year, 28 to 30 new store -- 28 to 32 new stores next year and 33 to 38 new stores in fiscal 2014. We currently have 76 stores in development totaling 2.8 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, and our initial outlook for fiscal year 2013, a 52-week year. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. 
For the first 3 weeks of Q4, idents increased 9.5% or 18.8%, on a 2-year basis. While we are pleased with these results, they represent a short period of time and also include some positive impact from the July 4 holiday shift. Our new range for the year implies idents of 7.6% to 8.6% for Q4 or 16% to 17% on a 2-year basis and 24.7% to 25.7% on a 3-year basis. For 2 and 3-year trends, these ranges are in line with our Q3 results on the low end and reflect an acceleration on the high end. 
As currently reflected in Street [ph] estimates, we typically see high average weekly sales in our second and third quarters, which drive stronger bottom line results, and then sales tend to drop in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our weakest quarter. Based on our Q3 results and our higher expectations now for the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal '12 outlook for operating margin to 6.4% and our diluted EPS range by $0.05 to $0.07. Our new fiscal year EPS range of $2.51 to $2.52 implies EPS of $0.59 to $0.60 for Q4. This includes the estimated impact on earnings from the extra week in Q4 of approximately $0.06 per share. 
For the fiscal year, adjusting for the impact of the extra week in Q4, we expect 27% EPS growth on total sales growth of 13% to 14%. For fiscal year 2013, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, we expect comps of 6.5% to 8.5% and EPS of $2.83 to $2.87. 
In summary, in an economic environment that is proving difficult for many retailers, we are thriving. We have opened 19 stores year-to-date and created over 7,000 new jobs throughout the company over the last 12 months. We just reported excellent quarterly results, raised our guidance for the current fiscal year and initiated guidance for next year. For 2013, we expect another year of healthy comp store sales growth, a record 28 to 32 new store openings, continuous operating margin improvement and earnings growth of 16% to 17%. 
Our growth plans are on track with ending square footage expected to accelerate through 2014. We are well positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position -- proposition and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. And our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you very much."

Actually, we don't think your question -- I mean, we're not seeing any regions where we're having to slow down on growth. We're actually, as you see, we're accelerating our growth. And we have greater capacity. We have more infrastructure in place. It's a great thing about the Whole Foods model with the 12 distinct regions. Each of them has the infrastructure in place on a regional basis to grow. And I mean, obviously, there's some type of physical limitation that a region could handle effectively for an upward limit, but we're not close to that in the region. In fact, it's just the opposite.

So I mean, we have plenty of Gen X customers, but we seem to do better with boomers and millennials. And we don't exactly know why that is. We can speculate on it somewhat that the millennials, a lot of them grew up eating Whole Foods because their parents began it. So they're already familiar with natural organic food. So it's not as big a transition for them. I think the whole purpose-driven aspects of Whole Foods Market has a strong appeal to the millennial generation. And the boomers, I mean, I think the thing that's driving them to convert is they're aging. And they'd like to stay young and healthy and vital and extend their longevity, so that's a natural push for them. And then I just think the millennials line up well with our philosophy and our purpose-driven aspects for our company. But the X-ers may be just a little bit tougher sell. And hey, the X-ers are younger than the boomers, but I don't think they've been able to repeal the aging process. So we think as they age as well, they will begin to turn more to Whole Foods as well.

So in a time when we have a very strong customer count increase, we'll have a relatively low or flat basket size. And then usually, it will cycle on itself sometime the next year, where we'll see those customers mature and start buying more and that ratio will change.

I would like to begin by expressing sympathy for the many people, including our Team Members, customers, suppliers and investors impacted by Hurricane Sandy. On behalf of our leadership team, I would also like to thank our Team Members for their exceptional efforts in the wake of this storm. We're proud to have been among the last to close and the first to reopen our doors in so many communities impacted by this powerful and destructive storm. 
Turning now to our financial results. Our Q4 performance reflects another quarter of strong sales momentum and earnings growth. On a 12-week-to-12-week basis, we produced 33% earnings per share growth on 14% sales growth. We delivered significant year-over-year improvement and record Q4 results, including a 76 basis point increase in gross margin to 35.3%, a 40 basis point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.5% of sales, a 117 basis point improvement in store contribution to 9.8% of sales, a 105 basis point increase in operating margin to 6%, marking our third consecutive quarter of over 100 basis points of improvement, a 79 basis point improvement of EBITDA margin to 8.7% and 157 basis point improvement and return on invested capital to 12.7%. 
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5%, and our identical store sales increased 8.3%. Given the continued moderation and inflation and sluggish economic data points, we are very pleased to produce an acceleration in our 2- and 3-year stacked idents. Our 3-year stacked ident increased 25.4%, reflecting 3 years of 8%-plus increases. 
In line with the trends we've seen all year, transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. Year-over-year, our customers continue to shift their purchases toward organic products and discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus sized baskets. Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped generate another quarter of healthy margin performance.  Our 54 basis point increase in gross margin x LIFO was driven by improvements in both occupancy costs and cost of goods sold. 
Sequentially from Q3, we saw an approximate 70 basis point decrease in total gross margin. This decrease is in line with our 3-year average sequential drop and is due primarily to seasonality, as well as some impact from our price investment strategy to improve our relative value positioning. The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum and the results from our most recent competitive survey. The survey indicates we meaningfully improved our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter, resulting in our most competitive position in more than 3 years. 
An important element to our value strategy is to continue to expand our Private Label offering. We're very excited about our recent launch of 70 new 365 and Whole Foods Market exclusive brand frozen items. These high-quality dishes are the value price point and cover key categories such as skillet meals, appetizers, desserts and ice creams. The products just started hitting our stores in late September and initial sales results are very positive. 
During the quarter, we opened 7 stores in West Des Moines Iowa, Colorado, New York City; Charlotte, North Carolina; San Francisco; San Antonio; and Newport Beach, California. West Des Moines, The Salt and Charlotte are all new markets for us. These 7 stores vary in size from 27,000 to 51,000 square feet and encompass trade areas with a broad range and the percentage of college grads, population density and median household income levels. We believe the diversity of these locations speaks to the breadth and variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. The last 6 quarters, on average, our new store class has consisted of 22 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $564,000, translating to sales per square foot of $780 and have generated a contribution margin of approximately 6%. 
Our outstanding results and new stores, combined with lower average capital investment and preopening expenses per store, are driving strong returns. For the quarter, our 19 comparable stores less than 2 years old produced a return on invested capital of 16%, the strongest Q4 result we have produced in 8 years. Check out the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for additional information about our new stores, expanded private labels offering and more. 
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 11 new leases, averaging 37,500 square feet in size in Altamonte Springs; Clearwater, Florida; Hyannis, Massachusetts; North Carolina; Morristown, New Jersey; 2 stores in New York City; Philadelphia; and South, Pennsylvania; Dalls; and Seattle. We're pleased to have finally secured location on the Upper East Side of New York City and to be expanding into Harlem as well. 
We have signed 45 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a record 32 to 34 new stores this fiscal year. This includes the recently announced acquisition of 6 leases from Johnny's Foodmaster, which is scheduled to close on November 30. The leases for stores averaging 31,000 square feet in size include South Weymouth, Darlington, Charleston, Charlestown, Brookline, Melrose and Somerville, Massachusetts. And we'll expand our presence in the greater Boston area to 26 stores. 
In summary, fiscal 2012 was a record-breaking year on so many levels. Our sales approached $12 billion, translating sales per gross square foot of $950. We reported 3 consecutive quarters of 3-year identical store sales growth of over 24%. We improved operating margin 94 basis points, 6.4%, generated over $1 billion in EBITDA and substantially exceeded our initial 53-week earnings per share guidance of $2.21 to $2.26. 
By actually growing EPS 31% year-over-year to $2.52, we opened 25 new stores, increasing our ending square footage 7.6% to over 12.7 million. We created over 8,500 new jobs. We narrowed the pricing gap versus our competitors on known value items to its narrowest margin yet, while continuing to raise the bar on our standards by eliminating all red rated species in our seafood departments last March. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated $1.3 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $920 million in cash flow from operations and $370 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $456 million in new and existing stores, returned $95 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $29 million of common stock. 
For the year, our total cash and investments increased $745 million to $1.5 billion. We are well positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth while maintaining a healthy cash balance and today announced a 43% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. 
In addition, we plan to create additional value for our shareholders through selected utilization of our remaining $170 million in stock repurchase authority. 
Turning to fiscal year 2013, for the first 5 weeks of Q1, we reported comparable store sales of 7.3%. During the short period, we were impacted by last year's LivingSocial deal and had 91 stores and 4 facilities in 4 regions impacted by Hurricane Sandy. While most stores and facilities were only closed temporarily, many stores in the northeast region were closed for several days, with several New York City stores just becoming fully operational last Friday. Given many customers were without power, shopping patterns were disrupted. We have not yet seen a full return to normal in these regions. 
Our comps company-wide for the past 2 days were over 11%, with the northeast region comping over 20%, clearly indicating customers are continuing to restock. We are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2013 and expect another year of healthy comparable store sales growth, continued operating margin improvement and record new store openings. Our guidance includes the Johnny's lease acquisitions and does not include a charge related to Hurricane Sandy that we expect we will take in the first quarter once our estimated uninsured losses are determined. 
We have opened 13 stores since our last earnings release. We currently have 79 stores in development, totaling 2.9 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. Our new stores are performing extremely well. With our pipeline and infrastructure in place, ending square footage growth is expected to continue to accelerate through 2014. We are well positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position and reinforcing our standing as America's Healthiest Grocery Store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to just one question at a time so that everybody has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:30 Central time. Thank you."

I would like to begin by expressing sympathy for the many people, including our team members, customers, suppliers and investors impacted by Hurricane Sandy. On behalf of our leadership team, I would also like to thank our team members for their exceptional efforts in the wake of this storm. We're proud to have been among the last to close and the first to reopen our doors in so many communities impacted by this powerful and destructive storm. 
Turning now to our financial results. Our Q4 performance reflects another quarter of strong sales momentum and earnings growth. On a 12-week-to-12-week basis, we produced 33% earnings per share growth on 14% sales growth. We delivered significant year-over-year improvement and record Q4 results, including a 76-basis-point increase in gross margin to 35.3%; a 40-basis-point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.5% of sales; a 117-basis-point improvement in store contribution to 9.8% of sales; a 105-basis-point increase in operating margin to 6%, making -- marking our third consecutive quarter of over 100 basis points of improvement; a 79-basis-point improvement of EBITDA margin to 8.7%; and 157-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital of 12.7%. 
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5%, and our identical store sales increased 8.3%. Given the continued moderation and inflation and sluggish economic data points, we're very pleased to produce an acceleration in our 2- and 3-year stacked idents. Our 3-year stacked ident increased 25.4%, reflecting 3 years of 8%-plus increases. 
In line with the trends we've seen all year, transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. Year-over-year, our customers continue to shift their purchases toward organic products and discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus-sized baskets. 
Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped generate another quarter of healthy margin performance.  Our 54-basis-point increase in gross margin, ex-LIFO, was driven by improvements in both occupancy costs and cost of goods sold. 
Sequentially, from Q3, we saw an approximate 70-basis-point decrease in total gross margin. This decrease is in line with our 3-year average sequential drop and is due primarily to seasonality, as well as some impact from our price investment strategy to improve our relative value positioning. 
The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum and the results from our most recent competitive survey. The survey indicates we meaningfully improved our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter, resulted -- resulting in our most competitive position in more than 3 years. 
An important element to our value strategy is to continue to expand our Private Label offering. We're very excited about our recent launch of 70 new 365 and Whole Foods Market exclusive brand frozen items. These high-quality dishes are at value price point and cover key categories such as skillet meals, [indiscernible], appetizers, desserts and ice creams. The products just started hitting our stores in late September, and initial sales results are very positive. 
During the quarter, we opened 7 stores in West Des Moines, Iowa; Basalt, Colorado; New York City; Charlotte, North Carolina; San Francisco; San Antonio; and Newport Beach, California. West Des Moines, Basalt and Charlotte are all new markets for us. These 7 stores vary in size from 27,000 to 51,000 square feet and encompass trade areas with a broad range in the percentage of college grads, population density and median household income levels. We believe the diversity of these locations speaks to the breadth and variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. Of the last 6 quarters, on average, our new store class has consisted of 22 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $564,000, translating to sales per square foot of $780 and have generated a contribution margin of approximately 6%. 
Our outstanding results and new stores, combined with lower average capital investment and preopening expenses per store, are driving strong returns. For the quarter, our 19 comparable stores less than 2 years old produced a return on invested capital of 16%, the strongest Q4 result we have produced in 8 years. Check out Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for additional information about our new stores, expanded private labels offering and more.
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 11 new leases, averaging 37,500 square feet in size in Altamonte Springs, Clearwater, Florida; Hyannis, Massachusetts; North Carolina; Morristown, New Jersey; 2 stores in New York City; Philadelphia; and South Hills, Pennsylvania; Dallas; and Seattle. We're pleased to have finally secured the location on the Upper East Side of New York City and to be expanding into Harlem as well. 
We have signed 45 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a record 32 to 34 new stores this fiscal year. This includes the recently announced acquisition of 6 leases from Johnnie's Foodmaster, which is scheduled to close on November 30. The leases for stores averaging 31,000 square feet in size include South Weymouth, Arlington, Charleston -- Charlestown, Brookline, Melrose and Somerville, Massachusetts. And we'll expand our presence in the Greater Boston area to 26 stores. 
In summary, fiscal 2012 was a record-breaking year on so many levels. Our sales approached $12 billion, translating sales per gross square foot of $950. We reported 3 consecutive quarters of 3-year identical store sales growth of over 24%. We improved operating margin 94 basis points, 6.4%, generated over $1 billion in EBITDA and substantially exceeded our initial 53-week earnings per share guidance of $2.21 to $2.26. 
By actually growing EPS 31% year-over-year to $2.52, we opened 25 new stores, increasing our ending square footage 7.6% to over 12.7 million. We created over 8,500 new jobs. We narrowed the pricing gap versus our competitors on known value items to its narrowest margin yet, while continuing to raise the bar on our standards by eliminating all red-rated species on our seafood departments last March. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated $1.3 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $920 million in cash flow from operations and $370 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $456 million in new and existing stores, returned $95 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $29 million of common stock. 
For the year, our total cash and investments increased $745 million to $1.5 billion. We are well-positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth while maintaining a healthy cash balance and today announced a 43% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. 
In addition, we plan to create additional value for our shareholders through selected utilization of our remaining $170 million in stock repurchase authority. 
Turning to fiscal year 2013, for the first 5 weeks of Q1, we reported comparable store sales of 7.3%. During the short period, we were impacted by last year's LivingSocial deal and had 91 stores and 4 facilities in 4 regions impacted by Hurricane Sandy. While most stores and facilities were only closed temporarily, many stores in the Northeast region were closed for several days, with several New York City stores just becoming fully operational last Friday. Given many customers were without power, and thus their shopping patterns were disrupted. We have not yet seen a full return to normal in these regions. 
Our comps companywide for the past 2 days were over 11%, with the Northeast region comping over 20%, clearly indicating customers are continuing to restock. 
We are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2013 and expect another year of healthy comparable store sales growth, continued operating margin improvement and record new store openings. Our guidance includes the Johnnie's lease acquisitions but does not include a charge related to Hurricane Sandy that we expect we will take in the first quarter once our estimated uninsured losses are determined. 
We have opened 13 stores since our last earnings release. We currently have 79 stores in development, totaling 2.9 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. Our new stores are performing extremely well. With our pipeline and infrastructure in place, ending square footage growth is expected to continue to accelerate through 2014. We are well-positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to just one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

So I mean, we've already talked about what we're going to do with our cash, but it bears repeating. One, we're accelerating our growth. We're opening more stores than we've ever opened before, signed 45 stores in the last 12 months, and we're growing faster. So that's our primary focus is to accelerate our growth and to transfer some of that cash into stores that will increase the value for our stakeholders. Number two, we are -- we just increased our dividend 43%, and that's a pretty good annual dividend increase. Third, we're going to be -- continue to be opportunistic in our stock buybacks. And fourth, we're going to continue to pile up cash. Part of that is you're right, it's not the best thing for EVA, but one of our valuable lessons from the Great Recession that occurred when we were caught with a lack of liquidity in a very bad time is we -- maybe we're preparing for a last war but seems to me that -- I'm not sure the American economy is out of its problems. So I'm not sure what's going to happen here. We've got lots of money being pumped into the economy by the fed. We've got this so-called fiscal cliff about to hit. We got tax rates going up. I think Whole Foods wants to keep a lot of powder dry, and we're just not sure what's going to happen. And so we like the position we're in. We're accelerating our growth and we're increasing our dividend, and we're buying back stock, and we're piling up cash. Many years ago, people ask us, ""When are you going to have some free cash flow? When are you going to have some free cash flow?"" Now we're hearing, ""You got too much free cash flow. What are you going to do with all that extra money?"" So that's what we're going to do with it, and we'll see how this economy plays out.

I would like to begin by expressing sympathy for the many people, including our team members, customers, suppliers and investors impacted by Hurricane Sandy. On behalf of our leadership team, I would also like to thank our team members for their exceptional efforts in the wake of this storm. We're proud to have been among the last to close and the first to reopen our doors in so many communities impacted by this powerful and destructive storm. 
Turning now to our financial results. Our Q4 performance reflects another quarter of strong sales momentum and earnings growth. On a 12-week-to-12-week basis, we produced 33% earnings per share growth on 14% sales growth. We delivered significant year-over-year improvement and record Q4 results, including a 76-basis-point increase in gross margin to 35.3%; a 40-basis-point decrease in direct store expenses to 25.5% of sales; a 117-basis-point improvement in store contribution to 9.8% of sales; a 105-basis-point increase in operating margin to 6%, making -- marking our third consecutive quarter of over 100 basis points of improvement; a 79-basis-point improvement of EBITDA margin to 8.7%; and 157-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital of 12.7%. 
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5%, and our identical store sales increased 8.3%. Given the continued moderation and inflation and sluggish economic data points, we're very pleased to produce an acceleration in our 2- and 3-year stacked idents. Our 3-year stacked ident increased 25.4%, reflecting 3 years of 8%-plus increases. 
In line with the trends we've seen all year, transaction count increased 7%, with broad-based sales momentum across regions, departments and store age classes. Year-over-year, our customers continue to shift their purchases toward organic products and discretionary categories. We also continue to see meaningful increases in $50-plus-sized baskets. 
Our robust sales and focused operating disciplines, along with moderating inflation, helped generate another quarter of healthy margin performance.  Our 54-basis-point increase in gross margin, ex-LIFO, was driven by improvements in both occupancy costs and cost of goods sold. 
Sequentially, from Q3, we saw an approximate 70-basis-point decrease in total gross margin. This decrease is in line with our 3-year average sequential drop and is due primarily to seasonality, as well as some impact from our price investment strategy to improve our relative value positioning. 
The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum and the results from our most recent competitive survey. The survey indicates we meaningfully improved our pricing position versus our competitors during the quarter, resulted -- resulting in our most competitive position in more than 3 years. 
An important element to our value strategy is to continue to expand our Private Label offering. We're very excited about our recent launch of 70 new 365 and Whole Foods Market exclusive brand frozen items. These high-quality dishes are at value price point and cover key categories such as skillet meals, [indiscernible], appetizers, desserts and ice creams. The products just started hitting our stores in late September, and initial sales results are very positive. 
During the quarter, we opened 7 stores in West Des Moines, Iowa; Basalt, Colorado; New York City; Charlotte, North Carolina; San Francisco; San Antonio; and Newport Beach, California. West Des Moines, Basalt and Charlotte are all new markets for us. These 7 stores vary in size from 27,000 to 51,000 square feet and encompass trade areas with a broad range in the percentage of college grads, population density and median household income levels. We believe the diversity of these locations speaks to the breadth and variety of market opportunities available to us in new and existing markets, as well as both urban and suburban locations. 
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. Of the last 6 quarters, on average, our new store class has consisted of 22 stores opened for approximately 6 months. At 38,000 square feet in size, they have produced average weekly sales of $564,000, translating to sales per square foot of $780 and have generated a contribution margin of approximately 6%. 
Our outstanding results and new stores, combined with lower average capital investment and preopening expenses per store, are driving strong returns. For the quarter, our 19 comparable stores less than 2 years old produced a return on invested capital of 16%, the strongest Q4 result we have produced in 8 years. Check out Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for additional information about our new stores, expanded private labels offering and more.
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 11 new leases, averaging 37,500 square feet in size in Altamonte Springs, Clearwater, Florida; Hyannis, Massachusetts; North Carolina; Morristown, New Jersey; 2 stores in New York City; Philadelphia; and South Hills, Pennsylvania; Dallas; and Seattle. We're pleased to have finally secured the location on the Upper East Side of New York City and to be expanding into Harlem as well. 
We have signed 45 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a record 32 to 34 new stores this fiscal year. This includes the recently announced acquisition of 6 leases from Johnnie's Foodmaster, which is scheduled to close on November 30. The leases for stores averaging 31,000 square feet in size include South Weymouth, Arlington, Charleston -- Charlestown, Brookline, Melrose and Somerville, Massachusetts. And we'll expand our presence in the Greater Boston area to 26 stores. 
In summary, fiscal 2012 was a record-breaking year on so many levels. Our sales approached $12 billion, translating sales per gross square foot of $950. We reported 3 consecutive quarters of 3-year identical store sales growth of over 24%. We improved operating margin 94 basis points, 6.4%, generated over $1 billion in EBITDA and substantially exceeded our initial 53-week earnings per share guidance of $2.21 to $2.26. 
By actually growing EPS 31% year-over-year to $2.52, we opened 25 new stores, increasing our ending square footage 7.6% to over 12.7 million, and we created over 8,500 new jobs. We narrowed the pricing gap versus our competitors on known value items to its narrowest margin yet, while continuing to raise the bar on our standards by eliminating all red-rated species on our seafood departments last March. 
Our solid performance, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated $1.3 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $920 million in cash flow from operations and $370 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $456 million in new and existing stores, returned $95 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased $29 million of common stock. 
For the year, our total cash and investments increased $745 million to $1.5 billion. We are well-positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth while maintaining a healthy cash balance and today announced a 43% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. 
In addition, we plan to create additional value for our shareholders through selected utilization of our remaining $170 million in stock repurchase authority. 
Turning to fiscal year 2013, for the first 5 weeks of Q1, we reported comparable store sales of 7.3%. During the short period, we were impacted by last year's LivingSocial deal and had 91 stores and 4 facilities in 4 regions impacted by Hurricane Sandy. While most stores and facilities were only closed temporarily, many stores in the Northeast region were closed for several days, with several New York City stores just becoming fully operational last Friday. Given many customers were without power, and thus their shopping patterns were disrupted, we have not yet seen a full return to normal in these regions. 
Our comps companywide for the past 2 days were over 11%, with the Northeast region comping over 20%, clearly indicating customers are continuing to restock. 
We are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2013 and expect another year of healthy comparable store sales growth, continued operating margin improvement and record new store openings. Our guidance includes the Johnnie's lease acquisitions, but does not include a charge related to Hurricane Sandy that we expect we will take in the first quarter once our estimated uninsured losses are determined. 
We have opened 13 stores since our last earnings release. We currently have 79 stores in development, totaling 2.9 million square feet and representing about 22% of our operating store base. Our new stores are performing extremely well. With our pipeline and infrastructure in place, ending square footage growth is expected to continue to accelerate through 2014. We are well-positioned to internally fund our growth and believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value position and reinforcing our standing as America's healthiest grocery store. 
We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to just one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:30 Central Time. Thank you."

The pre-storm, there were just 3 weeks, and it's hard to tell exactly when the pre-stocking started, so we're probably not willing to do that. And answer to the second question, I’ll let the operators join in, but it depends on the severity of the storm. Often times, it has been neutral because the pre-stocking has offset the impact during the storm itself. But in this case, because we actually had such a severe impact and stores were closed for so long and it took so long for so many customers to get power restored and therefore they weren't able to shop for groceries during that time, it is a bigger impact than it would have been with most typical storms we've seen over the last few years."

So I mean, we've already talked about what we're going to do with our cash, but it bears repeating. One, we're accelerating our growth. We're opening more stores than we've ever opened before, signed 45 stores in the last 12 months, and we're growing faster. So that's our primary focus is to accelerate our growth and to transfer some of that cash into stores that will increase the value for our stakeholders. Number two, we are -- we just increased our dividend 43%, and that's a pretty good annual dividend increase. Third, we're going to be -- continue to be opportunistic in our stock buybacks. And fourth, we're going to continue to pile up cash. Part of that is you're right, it's not the best thing for EVA, but one of our valuable lessons from the Great Recession that occurred when we were caught with a lack of liquidity in a very bad time is we -- maybe we're preparing for a last war, but seems to me that -- I'm not sure the American economy is out of its problems. So I'm not sure what's going to happen here. We've got lots of money being pumped into the economy by the fed. We've got this so-called fiscal cliff about to hit. We got tax rates going up. I think Whole Foods wants to keep a lot of powder dry, and we're just not sure what's going to happen. And so we like the position we're in. We're accelerating our growth and we're increasing our dividend, and we're buying back stock, and we're piling up cash. Many years ago, people ask us, ""When are you going to have some free cash flow? When are you going to have some free cash flow?"" Now we're hearing, ""You got too much free cash flow. What are you going to do with all that extra money?"" So that's what we're going to do with it, and we'll see how this economy plays out. And we may change our strategy, but for now the strategy is just what I told you."
