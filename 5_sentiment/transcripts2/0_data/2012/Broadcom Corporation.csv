Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with so much stronger revenue that we anticipated. Our quarterly revenue was $1.82 billion, above the guidance provided in December at our Analyst Day in New",357,"Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with so much stronger revenue that we anticipated. Our quarterly revenue was $1.82 billion, above the guidance provided in December at our Analyst Day in New York. 
At the outset of the year, we established a plan to outgrow the industry while delivering results within our target operating model. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on this goal. Broadcom's annual product revenue increased almost 9% year-over-year, significantly better than the overall industry, which grew in the low single digits. 
2011 non-GAAP product operating margin came in at 20.9%, within our targeted range of 20% to 22%. As a result, Broadcom delivered record cash flow from operations of more than $1.8 billion, driving record cash balances of $5.2 billion. 
At our Analyst Day, we talked about a few important competitive differentiators that we'll continue to highlight, IP strength, R&D scale, our complete system portfolio and our business model. Broadcom remains focused on enhancing our world-class IP portfolio. Ending 2011, Broadcom had more than 15,900 patents and applications. To put this in context, the U.S. Patent Office recognized Broadcom as receiving the 17th highest number of patents in the U.S. in 2011 among all industries and second among semiconductor companies, excluding memory. Looking forward, Broadcom will continue to leverage our leading IP portfolio into highly leveraged products to power communications from your handset to the base station through the network and back to devices in your home.
Broadcom's R&D scale and breadth of complete system solutions enables us to consistently gain share in our market, deliver solid profitability, reinvest in our businesses and return more capital to shareholders. In 2011, we nearly doubled the amount of capital return to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Today, we build upon that trend by announcing our second consecutive annual increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance, and then I'll go into the details on our business units, and talk about our plans for strategic growth."
136333,145487415,213177,"Broadcom Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary.Moving to the financial overview, to summarize, for Q4, total",734,"Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary.
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize, for Q4, total revenue of $1.82 billion, including $1.76 billion in product revenue. Q4 total net revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 6.4% from prior-year levels. Both GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin were down slightly from Q3 at 49.3% and 50.6% respectively. 
Q4 GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $30 million to $636 million. GAAP earnings per share for Q4 were $0.45 per share. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68 or $0.03 above first call consensus of $0.65 per share. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $482 million. Full year cash flow from operations was a record $1.84 billion. Our cash and marketable securities balance was $5.2 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin, in December at our analyst meeting, we said we expected Q4 total net revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. Total net revenue ended at $1.82 billion. Our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q3 due to a decrease in demand for our DTV and Blu-ray products. As anticipated, Mobile & Wireless segment was down 7%, driven by softness in demand for our wireless connectivity solutions.  Our Infrastructure Networking segment was down 13%, with most lines of business down in the quarter. 
Our Q4 GAAP product gross margin was down slightly at 49.3%, which translates to 50.6% on a non-GAAP basis, once again well within our target model. This was slightly below our expectations of roughly flat, driven by some unanticipated E&O charges.
Moving to operating expenses, total GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q4 were down $30 million from Q3 levels, significantly below the guidance we provided in December of down roughly $5 million. This favorability to guidance was principally driven by lower mask cost, lower-than-expected legal fees and some non-recurring credits to R&D and SG&A in the quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $482 million for Q4 and a record $1.84 billion for all of 2011. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at a record $5.2 billion, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows, a successful debt offering of $500 million and roughly $200 million in net option proceeds. These were offset by approximately $860 million of capital return to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases, plus roughly $350 million in M&A in 2011. 
For the full year, we repurchased 17 million shares of our stock. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 34 days in Q4. In addition, inventory levels decreased $70 million from Q3, resulting in a strong 8.5 turns in Q4.
Moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be roughly $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which is about 2 points better than mix adjusted seasonality. Sequential revenue expectations for our Broadband Communications and Mobile & Wireless segments are expected to be down in Q1 while our infrastructure networking sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q4. We expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q1 to increase by approximately $55 million to $65 million, driven principally by our annual merit increases and Q1 fringe accounting step up totaling roughly $40 million. In addition, stock-based compensation will be up approximately $10 million, also associated with our annual merit process. The remaining increases can be mostly explained by the impact of the non-recurring credits in Q4, plus a modest expense increases related to headcount and additional masks.
Excluding legal upticks and the effect of M&A in 2012, we expect GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to increase at a lower sequential rate for the rest of the year, consistent with what occurred in 2010 and 2011.  Please note, none of these numbers reflect any impact from the potential closing of the NetLogic transaction.
Finally, as Scott mentioned, we announced an 11% increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter. We believe this reflects our powerful cash generation profile as a growth company, our strong balance sheet and our ongoing commitment to return capital to our investors.
And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenues decreased 3% sequentially due to reduced demand for discontinued Blu-ray and DTV products. Over the summer, we announced the industry's first 1 gigahertz full band capture digital tuner in 3 new set-top boxes and DOCSIS 3.0 Gateway SoC solutions. These 40-nanometer devices deliver the tuner density and performance to accelerate IP-based video platforms while reducing cost and power and footprint.  In the fall, we announced an extension of that portfolio to our industry-leading satellite products; and today, I'm pleased to announce that we have production orders for these products and will ramp this innovative and disruptive technology in the middle of this year.
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, we introduced the industry's first integrated MoCA 2.0 system-on-a-chip portfolio, including 6 new set-top box and hybrid IP Gateway platforms. MoCA 2.0 more than doubles home network bandwidth, enhances quality, enhances security and enables more efficient energy efficient systems. We also introduced our latest solutions for hybrid TV and over-the-top media players. These 40-nanometer devices feature a high-performance CPU, advanced software integration and dual transcoding. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be down slightly in Q1.
Moving to infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was down 13% sequentially, driven by softness in Ethernet Switches and PHYs particularly in the enterprise and service provider segments. And 2011, our 10 gig-based T business grew more than 500%, reflecting Broadcom's market leadership. 
During the quarter, we introduced our new EPON OLT solution that reduces cost and power by up to 50% and displaces several stand-alone ASSPs with 1 high-performing and low-power system-on-a-chip. This single-chip quad OLT works together with our aggregation switch solutions to combine proven carrier network or carrier ethernet technology, with feature-rich EPON to meet scalability, reliability, cost and advanced feature set requirements of our next-generation fiber deployments.
We also announced the formation of the 1 pair Ethernet or open special-interest group to drive adoption of ethernet-based automotive connectivity. Membership has grown to 19 companies, including 3 major automotive manufacturers, 4 Tier 1 suppliers and 3 major semiconductor companies. We're seeing critical mass that continues to build on the automotive space around ethernet in general and our BroadR-Reach technology in particular.
As we look into Q1, we expect revenue from our infrastructure solutions to be roughly flat sequentially. We'll update you on NetLogic as more information becomes available. We have an enormous amount of work in motion on this front.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment experienced a 7% sequential decline in revenue as growth in 3G baseband and continued strong market share in wireless connectivity combo chips was more than offset by softness in 2G baseband and multimedia solutions.
At CES, we unveiled industry's first chip supporting an important new Wi-Fi standard, 802.11ac, the fifth generation of Wi-Fi. 5G Wi-Fi leads up to 3x faster than its predecessor and also provide significant improvements in reliability, range and coverage. 5G Wi-Fi has attracted the carriers were looking to offload more content from their license spectrum and to consumers for streaming greater amount of video content in the woman between devices. We have already received early production orders for our 5G Wi-Fi chips, and consumers will start to see product in the marketplace in Q3. We expect that by 2015, virtually all new Wi-Fi products will be based on 802.11ac. Also at CES, we demonstrated next-generation GPS technologies and energy solutions and our emerging 4G LTE technology.
Earlier this month, we introduced a new 1 gigahert HSPA baseband and reference design, the 2155 2G which includes an HSPA modem, a 1 gigahertz application processors, high-performance graphics and leading connectivity, including Wi-Fi direct, Bluetooth low energy, advanced navigation and NFC. This reference design showcases Broadcom's ability to deliver smartphone features into a more cost-effective platform that can be quickly brought to market by a wide range of handset OEMs.
These innovations continue to drive momentum with new customers and new platforms. As 1 example, the Samsung GALAXY Y is a powerful smartphone that's one of the top-selling smartphones in India. Additionally, we continue to see new 3G customers coming online, including ZTE, Foxlink and G5.  We expect revenue from our Mobile & Wireless solutions overall to decline somewhat into Q1, but for both 3G basebands and wireless connectivity combo chips to continue to increase sequentially.
In summary, Broadcom continues to benefit from powerful trends in the communications market. We see smartphones proliferating around the globe. We see increasing attach rates for a wide range of connectivity technologies across an ever-increasing number of products. We see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market and delivering a whole new level of wireless networking performance in the home and on the road. We see 10-gig Ethernet benefiting from server upgrades in the Data Center. We also see innovation in the home that's enabling content to be transmitted more quickly to and networked around the home.  Broadcom remains committed outstanding communications product that make communicating and sharing that much easier, faster, more cost-effective and more power efficient.

So I would expect access points initially very rapidly into PCs, laptops, into consumer devices, especially HD video-related devices. I think that will be a little different than what we saw in some of the previous generations of wireless LANs. We'll see more of a consumer electronics pickup as well. And then, I think probably into next year, you'll start to see pickup in the handsets. One of the advantages of 5G Wi-Fi is that it consumes less power for the amount of data transmitted. And for all of you who look around for power outlets in the middle of the day with your smartphones I think that makes a big difference if you can get some battery savings on that. And so it will not only be a better performance, but better battery utilization as well. I think in terms of -- you asked about our opportunity here.

Beyond that design and development prototyping, masks et cetera should be up between $5 million and $10 million. The other thing that you'll see when the 10-K comes out tomorrow is actually for the first time in a long time, the actual headcount is Broadcom went down about a hundred people quarter on quarter. And so what you're seeing is in Q4, as we exited the Digital TV and Blu-ray business, a drop in those resources and then a rehiring of targeted resources in Mobile & Wireless. And that's part of that's probably a couple of million dollars just on the resourcing cost. So will that reflect confidence in the business I think it affects the same confidence we talked about an Analyst Day. I think there's naturally some timing of a couple of million dollars, but you can see it's pretty tight in terms of how we're managing it."

But I think for now, until we start seeing the kind of revenue levels we saw in Q3 and beyond, we would be relatively tight in our management of our expense structure."

Historically, we had sort of said 7 taken I think as our hubbing business grows that was is downloaded and probably closer to 6.5 to 7.5 is more the right target. Having said that, I think that given our sourcing strategy, we are prepared if we need to ramp our inventory based on significant growth on demand and a big way good shape rolling through Q1 and certainly based on what we projected order and delivery in Q1 or Q2. We have much tighter process. In fact our turns have grown from the beginning of 2011 at about 6.4 to what you see the year-end number at 8.5. And so almost over 2 full turns growth. And I think that's the product of really strong processes. Our operations group have been much tighter communication and build plans. So it's given us that flexibility and provided us the additional cash. In terms of the gross margin puts and takes as you look at Q4 versus Q1, let's start with Q4. Q4, actually the standard margin was slightly favorable offset by 2 things. One was that you know issue that I mentioned, which was a late quarter event as a particular customer lowered their forecast and we have a fairly mechanical calculation on the way we take the reserve and the other thing being the absorption impact of the strong Q3 into Q4. As you roll to Q4, your observation is correct that there is some favorability and standard margin based on mix. That winds up being offset somewhat by 2 things. It's offset by absorption, again based on assumption of a lower revenue number, relative to the number we did in Q4, and then secondarily, believe it or not, the OpEx issue that we have as it relates to fringe and merit takes place in ops as well and triggers an overhead jump in the operations area. Which trigger sort of this one-time, nonstandard cost effect in the numbers, which is how we get to flat. But I would say underneath that, if you look at the standard margins, which is really what the true product costing, it's actually modestly favorable both in Q4 and Q1."

Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with so much stronger revenue than we anticipated. Our quarterly revenue was $1.82 billion, above the guidance provided in December at our Analyst Day in New",356,"Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with so much stronger revenue than we anticipated. Our quarterly revenue was $1.82 billion, above the guidance provided in December at our Analyst Day in New York.
At the outset of the year, we established a plan to outgrow the industry while delivering results within our target operating model. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on this goal. Broadcom's annual product revenue increased almost 9% year-over-year, significantly better than the overall industry, which grew in the low single digits.
2011 non-GAAP product operating margin came in at 20.9%, within our targeted range of 20% to 22%. As a result, Broadcom delivered record cash flow from operations of more than $1.8 billion, driving record cash balances of $5.2 billion.
At our Analyst Day, we talked about a few important competitive differentiators that we'll continue to highlight, IP strength, R&D scale, our complete system portfolio and our business model. Broadcom remains focused on enhancing our world-class IP portfolio. Ending 2011, Broadcom had more than 15,900 patents and applications. To put this in context, the U.S. Patent Office recognized Broadcom as receiving the 17th highest number of patents in the U.S. in 2011 among all industries and second among semiconductor companies, excluding memory. Looking forward, Broadcom will continue to leverage our leading IP portfolio into highly leveraged products that power communications from your handset, to the base station, through the network and back to devices in your home.
Broadcom's R&D scale and breadth of complete system solutions enables us to consistently gain share in our market, deliver solid profitability, reinvest in our businesses and return more capital to shareholders. In 2011, we nearly doubled the amount of capital return to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Today, we build upon that trend by announcing our second consecutive annual increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance, and then I'll go into details on our business units, and talk about our plans for strategic growth."

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary.
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize, for Q4, total revenue of $1.82 billion, including $1.76 billion in product revenue. Q4 total net revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 6.4% from prior-year levels. Both GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin were down slightly from Q3 at 49.3% and 50.6%, respectively.
Q4 GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $30 million to $636 million. GAAP earnings per share for Q4 were $0.45 per share. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68 or $0.03 above First Call Consensus of $0.65 per share. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $482 million. Full year cash flow from operations was a record $1.84 billion. Our cash and marketable securities balance was $5.2 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin, in December at our analyst meeting, we said we expected Q4 total net revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. Total net revenue ended at $1.82 billion. Our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q3 due to a decrease in demand for our DTV and Blu-ray products. As anticipated, the Mobile & Wireless segment was down 7%, driven by softness in demand for our wireless connectivity solutions. Our Infrastructure & Networking segment was down 13%, with most lines of business down in the quarter.
Our Q4 GAAP product gross margin was down slightly at 49.3%, which translates to 50.6% on a non-GAAP basis, once again well within our target model. This was slightly below our expectations of roughly flat, driven by some unanticipated E&O charges.
Moving to operating expenses, total GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q4 were down $30 million from Q3 levels, significantly below the guidance we provided in December of down roughly $5 million. This favorability to guidance was principally driven by lower mask cost, lower-than-expected legal fees and some non-recurring credits to R&D and SG&A in the quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $482 million for Q4 and a record $1.84 billion for all of 2011. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at a record $5.2 billion, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows, a successful debt offering of $500 million and roughly $200 million in net option proceeds. These were offset by approximately $860 million of capital returned to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases, plus roughly $350 million in M&A in 2011.
For the full year, we repurchased 17 million shares of our stock. Our accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 34 days in Q4. In addition, inventory levels decreased $70 million from Q3, resulting in a strong 8.5 turns in Q4.
Moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be roughly $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which is about 2 points better than mix adjusted seasonality. Sequential revenue expectations for our Broadband Communications and Mobile & Wireless segments are expected to be down in Q1, while our Infrastructure & Networking sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q4. We expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q1 to increase by approximately $55 million to $65 million, driven principally by our annual merit increases and Q1 fringe accounting step up totaling roughly $40 million. In addition, stock-based compensation will be up approximately $10 million, also associated with our annual merit process. The remaining increases can be mostly explained by the impact of the non-recurring credits in Q4, plus the modest expense increases related to headcount and additional masks.
Excluding legal upticks and the effect of M&A in 2012, we expect GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to increase at a lower sequential rate for the rest of the year, consistent with what occurred in 2010 and 2011. Please note, none of these numbers reflect any impact from the potential closing of the NetLogic transaction.
Finally, as Scott mentioned, we announced an 11% increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter. We believe this reflects our powerful cash generation profile as a growth company, our strong balance sheet and our ongoing commitment to return capital to our investors.
And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

We also introduced our latest solutions for hybrid TV and over-the-top media players. These 40-nanometer devices feature a high-performance CPU, advanced software integration and dual transcoding. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be down slightly in Q1.
Moving to infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was down 13% sequentially, driven by softness in Ethernet Switches and PHYs, particularly in the enterprise and service provider segments. In 2011, our 10 gig BASE-T business grew more than 500%, reflecting Broadcom's market leadership.
During the quarter, we introduced our new EPON OLT solution that reduces cost and power by up to 50% and displaces several stand-alone ASSPs with one high-performing and low-power system-on-a-chip. This single-chip quad OLT works together with our aggregation switch solutions to combine proven carrier network or Carrier Ethernet technology, with feature-rich EPON to meet scalability, reliability, cost and advanced feature set requirements of our next-generation fiber deployments.
We also announced the formation of the One Pair Ethernet or OPEN Special Interest Group to drive adoption of Ethernet-based automotive connectivity. Membership has grown to 19 companies, including 3 major automotive manufacturers, 4 Tier 1 suppliers and 3 major semiconductor companies. We're seeing critical mass that continues to build in the automotive space around Ethernet in general and our BroadR-Reach technology in particular.
As we look into Q1, we expect revenue from our infrastructure solutions to be roughly flat sequentially. We'll update you on NetLogic as more information becomes available. We have an enormous amount of work in motion on this front.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment experienced a 7% sequential decline in revenue as growth in 3G baseband and continued strong market share in wireless connectivity combo chips was more than offset by softness in 2G baseband and multimedia solutions.
At CES, we unveiled industry's first chip supporting an important new Wi-Fi standard, 802.11ac, the fifth generation of Wi-Fi. 5G Wi-Fi runs up to 3x faster than its predecessor and also provide significant improvements in reliability, range and coverage. 5G Wi-Fi has attracted the carriers who are looking to offload more content from their licensed spectrum, and to consumers who are streaming great amounts of video content in the home and between devices. We have already received early production orders for our 5G Wi-Fi chips, and consumers will start to see products in the marketplace in Q3. We expect that by 2015, virtually all new Wi-Fi products will be based on 802.11ac. Also at CES, we demonstrated next-generation GPS technologies and NFC solutions and our emerging 4G LTE technology.
Earlier this month, we introduced a new 1 gigahertz HSPA baseband and reference design, the 21552G which includes an HSPA modem, a 1 gigahertz application processor, high-performance graphics and leading connectivity, including Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth low energy, advanced navigation and NFC. This reference design showcases Broadcom's ability to deliver smartphone features into a more cost-effective platform that can be quickly brought to market by a wide range of handset OEMs.
These innovations continue to drive momentum with new customers and new platforms. As one example, the Samsung GALAXY Y is a powerful smartphone, that's one of the top-selling smartphones in India. Additionally, we continue to see new 3G customers coming online, including ZTE, Foxlink and G'Five. We expect revenue from our Mobile & Wireless solutions overall to decline somewhat into Q1, but for both 3G basebands and wireless connectivity combo chips to continue to increase sequentially.
In summary, Broadcom continues to benefit from powerful trends in the communications market. We see smartphones proliferating around the globe. We see increasing attach rates for a wide range of connectivity technologies across an ever-increasing number of products. We see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market and delivering a whole new level of wireless networking performance in the home and on the road. We see 10-gig Ethernet benefiting from server upgrades in the data center. We also see innovation in the home that's enabling content to be transmitted more quickly to and networked around the home. Broadcom remains firmly committed to creating outstanding communications product that make communicating and sharing that much easier, faster, more cost-effective and more power efficient.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready for your questions. Manisha, may we have the first question please."

I would say will be comparable to n or perhaps even faster. I think the infrastructure partners, those who sell wireless access points and things like that will probably move the most quickly because it really provides a real benefit, and the extra performance, the extra range, extra coverage makes a real difference in a consumer household and will enable you to do things like stream HD video much more reliably around the house. So I would expect access points initially, very rapidly into PCs, laptops, into consumer devices, especially HD video-related devices. I think that will be a little different than what we saw in some of the previous generations of wireless LAN. We'll see more of a consumer electronics pickup as well. And then, I think probably into next year, you'll start to see pickup in the handsets. One of the advantages of 5G Wi-Fi is that it consumes less power for the amount of data transmitted. And for all of you who look around for power outlets in the middle of the day with your smartphones, I think that makes a big difference if you can get some battery savings on that. And so, it will not only be a better performance, but better battery utilization as well. I think in terms of -- you asked about our opportunity here. To my knowledge, Broadcom is the only the major semiconductor company with this technology available today. I think we've got a multi-quarter lead here, and our goal is to get that into as many customers' hands as possible."

It's a real game changer. It really allows us to create some devices that our competitors aren't going to be able to deliver on with multiple tuners and fast channel change and things like that. So that's an opportunity for us. It also allows us to do some nice things in the modem space as well. We definitely see customers continuing to deploy. As I mentioned to a question earlier, geographical expansion is a real opportunity for us in Q1 and going forward. And so those are the primary drivers there. We have a little bit of a headwind because of the discontinuation of our Blu-ray and DTV business. So that's the headwind on the business, but nevertheless, we still managed to drive that business strongly and expect over the long term to see that as a good growth opportunity as we penetrate those other areas."

I expect GPS still has some opportunity to go as we see that used for location-based services, emergency services and so forth. So I think, we're not in the latter innings yet on combo penetration into those devices. I think we'll see them both penetrate further down into feature phones, as well as broaden the features, things like NFC next year, things like 5G Wi-Fi that will give us an opportunity for ASP increase as well as selling more chips."

We know of no other competitor who really can say they're best-in-class for all the components of these combo chips. And that's important for our customers. At the same time, we've really raised the bar by adding things like NFC, moving to 5G Wi-Fi next year, Bluetooth, low energy, a lot of the location capabilities we put in GPS. We really think have not yet been matched by competition. So I made this comment, I think, at our Analyst Day, and at some of our meetings at CES. But I think there's an opportunity for us to increase share in combo chips over the course of this year rather than to see any particular share loss. Does that mean that competitors aren't going to get any share at all? No, they're going to pick off some, and they each have opportunities and niches where they'll fit in.

Yes I think 8.5 is probably tighter then we would typically want to run our turn. Historically, we have sort of said, 7 to 8, and I think as our hubbing business grows that sort of pulls that down a little bit, and probably it's closer to 6.5 to 7.5 is more of the right target. Having said that, I think that given our sourcing strategy, we are prepared if we need to, to ramp our inventory based on significant growth in demand and I think we're in good shape rolling through Q1 and certainly based on what we project to order and delivery in Q1 or Q2. We have much tighter process. In fact, our turns have grown from the beginning of 2011 at about 6.4 to what you see the year-end number at 8.5. And so, it's almost over 2 full turns growth. And I think that's the product of really strong processes. Our operations group been much tighter communication and build plans. So it's given us that flexibility and provided the additional cash. In terms of the gross margin puts and takes as you look at Q4 versus Q1, let's start with Q4. In Q4, actually the standard margin was slightly favorable offset by 2 things. One was the E&O thing that I -- the E&O issue that I mentioned, which was a late quarter event as a particular customer lowered their forecast, and we have a fairly mechanical calculation on the way we take E&O reserve and the other thing being the absorption impact of the strong Q3 into Q4. As you roll to Q4, your observation is correct that there is some favorability in standard margin based on mix. That winds up being offset somewhat by 2 things. It's offset by absorption, again based on an assumption of a lower revenue number, relative to the number we did in Q4, and then secondarily, believe it or not, the OpEx issue that we have as it relates to fringe and merit takes place in ops as well and triggers an overhead jump in the operations area. Which trigger sort of this one-time, nonstandard cost effect in the numbers, which is how we get to flat. But I would say underneath that, if you look at the standard margins, which is really what -- the true product costing, it's actually modestly favorable both in Q4 and Q1."

Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with somewhat stronger revenue than we anticipated.

Broadcom performed well in the December quarter, with somewhat stronger revenue than we anticipated. Our quarterly revenue was $1.82 billion, above the guidance provided in December at our Analyst Day in New York.
At the outset of the year, we established a plan to outgrow the industry while delivering results within our target operating model. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on this goal. Broadcom's annual product revenue increased almost 9% year-over-year, significantly better than the overall industry, which grew in the low single digits.
2011 non-GAAP product operating margin came in at 20.9%, within our targeted range of 20% to 22%. As a result, Broadcom delivered record cash flow from operations of more than $1.8 billion, driving record cash balances of $5.2 billion.
At our Analyst Day, we talked about a few important competitive differentiators that we'll continue to highlight, IP strength, R&D scale, our complete system portfolio and our business model. Broadcom remains focused on enhancing our world-class IP portfolio. Ending 2011, Broadcom had more than 15,900 patents and applications. To put this in context, the U.S. Patent Office recognized Broadcom as receiving the 17th highest number of patents in the U.S. in 2011 among all industries and second among semiconductor companies, excluding memory. Looking forward, Broadcom will continue to leverage our leading IP portfolio into highly leveraged products that power communications from your handset, to the base station, through the network and back to devices in your home.
Broadcom's R&D scale and breadth of complete system solutions enables us to consistently gain share in our market, deliver solid profitability, reinvest in our businesses and return more capital to shareholders. In 2011, we nearly doubled the amount of capital return to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Today, we build upon that trend by announcing our second consecutive annual increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance, and then I'll go into details on our business units, and talk about our plans for strategic growth."
136333,145487415,213367,"Broadcom Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary.Moving to the financial overview, to summarize, for Q4, total r",737,"Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary.
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize, for Q4, total revenue of $1.82 billion, including $1.76 billion in product revenue. Q4 total net revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 6.4% from prior-year levels. Both GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin were down slightly from Q3 at 49.3% and 50.6%, respectively.
Q4 GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $30 million to $636 million. GAAP earnings per share for Q4 were $0.45 per share. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68 or $0.03 above First Call Consensus of $0.65 per share. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $482 million. Full year cash flow from operations was a record $1.84 billion. Our cash and marketable securities balance was $5.2 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin, in December at our analyst meeting, we said we expected Q4 total net revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion. Total net revenue ended at $1.82 billion. Our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q3 due to a decrease in demand for our DTV and Blu-ray products. As anticipated, the Mobile & Wireless segment was down 7%, driven by softness in demand for our wireless connectivity solutions. Our Infrastructure & Networking segment was down 13%, with most lines of business down in the quarter.
Our Q4 GAAP product gross margin was down slightly at 49.3%, which translates to 50.6% on a non-GAAP basis, once again well within our target model. This was slightly below our expectations of roughly flat, driven by some unanticipated E&O charges.
Moving to operating expenses, total GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q4 were down $30 million from Q3 levels, significantly below the guidance we provided in December of down roughly $5 million. This favorability to guidance was principally driven by lower mask cost, lower-than-expected legal fees and some non-recurring credits to R&D and SG&A in the quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $482 million for Q4, and a record $1.84 billion for all of 2011. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at a record $5.2 billion, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows, a successful debt offering of $500 million and roughly $200 million in net option proceeds. These were offset by approximately $860 million of capital returned to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases, plus roughly $350 million in M&A in 2011.
For the full year, we repurchased 17 million shares of our stock. Our accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 34 days in Q4. In addition, inventory levels decreased $70 million from Q3, resulting in a strong 8.5 turns in Q4.
Moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be roughly $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which is about 2 points better than mix adjusted seasonality. Sequential revenue expectations for our Broadband Communications and Mobile & Wireless segments are expected to be down in Q1, while our Infrastructure & Networking sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q4. We expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q1 to increase by approximately $55 million to $65 million, driven principally by our annual merit increases and Q1 fringe accounting step up totaling roughly $40 million. In addition, stock-based compensation will be up approximately $10 million, also associated with our annual merit process. The remaining increases can be mostly explained by the impact of the non-recurring credits in Q4, plus the modest expense increases related to headcount and additional masks.
Excluding legal upticks and the effect of M&A in 2012, we expect GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to increase at a lower sequential rate for the rest of the year, consistent with what occurred in 2010 and 2011. Please note, none of these numbers reflect any impact from the potential closing of the NetLogic transaction.
Finally, as Scott mentioned, we announced an 11% increase in our dividend to $0.10 per quarter. We believe this reflects our powerful cash generation profile as a growth company, our strong balance sheet and our ongoing commitment to return capital to our investors.
And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenues decreased 3% sequentially due to reduced demand for discontinued Blu-ray and DTV products. Over this summer, we announced the industry's first 1 gigahertz Full-Band Capture digital tuner in 3 new set-top boxes and DOCSIS 3.0 Gateway SoC solutions. These 40-nanometer devices deliver the tuner density and performance to accelerate IP-based video platforms, while reducing cost and power and footprint.  In the fall, we announced an extension of that portfolio to our industry-leading satellite products, and today, I'm pleased to announce that we have production orders for these products and will ramp this innovative and disruptive technology in the middle of this year.
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, we introduced the industry's first integrated MoCA 2.0 system-on-a-chip portfolio, including 6 new set-top box and hybrid IP Gateway platforms. MoCA 2.0 more than doubles home network bandwidth, enhances video quality, enhances security and enables more efficient energy efficient systems. We also introduced our latest solutions for hybrid TV and over-the-top media players. These 40-nanometer devices feature a high-performance CPU, advanced software integration and dual transcoding. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be down slightly in Q1.
Moving to infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was down 13% sequentially, driven by softness in Ethernet Switches and PHYs, particularly in the enterprise and service provider segments. In 2011, our 10 gig BASE-T business grew more than 500%, reflecting Broadcom's market leadership.
During the quarter, we introduced our new EPON OLT solution that reduces cost and power by up to 50% and displaces several stand-alone ASSPs with one high-performance and low-power system-on-a-chip. This single-chip quad OLT works together with our aggregation switch solutions to combine proven carrier network -- or Carrier Ethernet technology, with feature-rich EPON to meet scalability, reliability, cost and advanced feature set requirements of our next-generation fiber deployments.
We also announced the formation of the One Pair Ethernet or OPEN Special Interest Group to drive adoption of Ethernet-based automotive connectivity. Membership has grown to 19 companies, including 3 major automotive manufacturers, 4 Tier 1 suppliers and 3 major semiconductor companies. We're seeing critical mass that continues to build in the automotive space around Ethernet in general, and our BroadR-Reach technology in particular.
As we look into Q1, we expect revenue from our infrastructure solutions to be roughly flat sequentially. We'll update you on NetLogic as more information becomes available. We have an enormous amount of work in motion on this front.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment experienced a 7% sequential decline in revenue as growth in 3G baseband and continued strong market share in wireless connectivity combo chips was more than offset by softness in 2G baseband and multimedia solutions.
At CES, we unveiled the industry's first chip supporting an important new Wi-Fi standard, 802.11ac, the fifth generation of Wi-Fi. 5G Wi-Fi runs up to 3x faster than its predecessor and also provides significant improvements in reliability, range and coverage. 5G Wi-Fi is attractive to carriers who are looking to offload more content from their licensed spectrum, and to consumers who are streaming greater amounts of video content in the home and between devices. We have already received early production orders for our 5G Wi-Fi chips, and consumers will start to see products in the marketplace in Q3. We expect that by 2015, virtually all new Wi-Fi products will be based on 802.11ac. Also at CES, we demonstrated next-generation GPS technologies and NFC solutions and our emerging 4G LTE technology.
Earlier this month, we introduced a new 1 gigahertz HSPA baseband and reference design, the 21552G which includes an HSPA modem, a 1 gigahertz application processor, high-performance graphics and leading connectivity, including Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth low energy, advanced navigation and NFC. This reference design showcases Broadcom's ability to deliver smartphone features into a more cost-effective platform that can be quickly brought to market by a wide range of handset OEMs.
These innovations continue to drive momentum with new customers and new platforms. As one example, the Samsung GALAXY Y is a powerful smartphone, that's one of the top-selling smartphones in India. Additionally, we continue to see new 3G customers coming online, including ZTE, Foxlink and G'Five. We expect revenue from our Mobile & Wireless solutions overall to decline somewhat into Q1, but for both 3G basebands and wireless connectivity combo chips, to continue to increase sequentially.
In summary, Broadcom continues to benefit from powerful trends in the communications market. We see smartphones proliferating around the globe. We see increasing attach rates for a wide range of connectivity technologies across an ever-increasing number of products. We see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market and delivering a whole new level of wireless networking performance in the home and on the road. We see 10-gig Ethernet benefiting from server upgrades in the data center. We also see innovation in the home that's enabling content to be transmitted more quickly to and networked around the home. Broadcom remains firmly committed to creating outstanding communications products that make communicating and sharing that much easier, faster, more cost-effective and more power efficient.

I would say will be comparable to n or perhaps even faster. I think the infrastructure partners, those who sell wireless access points and things like that will probably move the most quickly because it really provides a real benefit, and the extra performance, the extra range, extra coverage makes a real difference in a consumer household and will enable you to do things like stream HD video much more reliably around the house. So I would expect access points initially, very rapidly into PCs, laptops, into consumer devices, especially HD video-related devices. I think that will be a little different than what we saw in some of the previous generations of wireless LAN. We'll see more of a consumer electronics pickup as well. And then, I think probably into next year, you'll start to see pickup in the handsets. One of the advantages of 5G Wi-Fi is that it consumes less power for the amount of data transmitted. And for all of you who look around for power outlets in the middle of the day with your smartphones, I think that makes a big difference if you can get some battery savings on that. And so, it will not only be a better performance, but better battery utilization as well. I think in terms of -- you asked about our opportunity here. To my knowledge, Broadcom is the only the major semiconductor company with this technology available today. I think we've got a multi-quarter lead here, and our goal is to get that into as many customers' hands as possible."

Historically, we have sort of said, 7 to 8, and I think as our hubbing business grows that sort of pulls that down a little bit, and probably it's closer to 6.5 to 7.5 is more of the right target. Having said that, I think that given our sourcing strategy, we are prepared if we need to, to ramp our inventory based on significant growth in demand. And I think we're in good shape rolling through Q1, and certainly based on what we project to order and delivery in Q1 or Q2. We have much tighter process. In fact, our turns have grown from the beginning of 2011 at about 6.4 to what you see the year-end number at 8.5. And so, it's almost over 2 full turns growth. And I think that's the product of really strong processes. Our operations group been much tighter communication and build plans. So it's given us that flexibility and provided the additional cash. In terms of the gross margin puts and takes as you look at Q4 versus Q1, let's start with Q4. In Q4, actually the standard margin was slightly favorable offset by 2 things. One was the E&O thing that I -- the E&O issue that I mentioned, which was a late quarter event as a particular customer lowered their forecast, and we have a fairly mechanical calculation on the way we take E&O reserve and the other thing being the absorption impact of the strong Q3 into Q4. As you roll to Q4, your observation is correct that there is some favorability in standard margin based on mix. That winds up being offset somewhat by 2 things. It's offset by absorption, again based on an assumption of a lower revenue number, relative to the number we did in Q4, and then secondarily, believe it or not, the OpEx issue that we have as it relates to fringe and merit takes place in ops as well and triggers an overhead jump in the operations area. Which triggers sort of this one-time, nonstandard cost effect in the numbers, which is how we get to flat. But I would say underneath that, if you look at the standard margins, which is really what -- the true product costing, it's actually modestly favorable both in Q4 and Q1."

Excluding NetLogic, revenue would've been $1.79 billion, which is at the high end of the guided range and ahead of mix adjusted seasonality for our business. 
We also reported stronger earnings and gross margins than we anticipated due to solid product cost improvements and expense discipline. We're off to a strong start in 2012. 
We have many exciting business updates to talk about later today. We've extended our lead in 5G Wi-Fi, and we've seen solid growth in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. We introduced new broadband platforms for international and developed market and also meaningfully expanded the addressable market for our Infrastructure solutions. These accomplishments led to record design wins across all 3 segments in Q1 which was an important sign of strength for our business.

Given the mid-quarter closure of the NetLogic acquisition and that our guidance in January did not reflect it, we will provide a little more color on the revenue contribution of NetLogic. Please note that we do not anticipate breaking out this information in the future.  As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize for Q1, total revenue of $1.83 billion, total product revenue of $1.77 billion, including $33 million from NetLogic. Q1 total net revenue excluding NetLogic was down 1.4% sequentially and down 1.2% from prior year levels. 
Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points from Q4 to 52%. Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%. Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $54 million and $89 million respectively from Q4 levels. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65 per share or $0.10 above first call consensus of $0.55. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15 including $0.13 of acquisition-related charges and $0.12 of onetime adjustments outlined in our earnings release. 
Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $368 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter were $2.1 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin, in January, we said we expected Q1 total net revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Excluding NetLogic, we delivered revenue near the top end of that range. Total net revenue ended at $1.83 billion, of which NetLogic contributed $33 million. On a standalone basis, NetLogic total revenue for the first quarter of 2012 would have been $83 million, meaning $50 million pre-acquisition period revenue was not recorded in Broadcom's financial segments.
As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q4, which was better than our normal Q1 seasonal decrease in demand for broadband. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was flat sequentially from Q4 as strength in 3G, basebands and Wi-Fi combos was offset by anticipated softness in 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessors. 
Including NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 6% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was down 3% due to a weakness in the service provider market and a decrease in our controller products.
Our Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points to 52%. This was better than our expectations of roughly flat, driven principally by lower costs and a decrease in the ENL provision during the quarter. Our Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%, driven primarily by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $45 million.
Moving to operating expenses, total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were up $54 million from Q4 levels, including NetLogic, which is favorable to the guidance provided in January, principally driven by lower employee costs and lower than expected legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were $89 million, up from Q4 levels. Approximately $24 million relates to the NetLogic stock-based compensation assumed in the quarter.
During the quarter, we recorded settlement costs of $86 million related to patent infringement claims, as well as an impairment of acquisition intangibles of $28 million. We also recorded a onetime non-cash benefit for income taxes of roughly $46 million, related to the purchase price accounting associated with the NetLogic transaction. These items are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q filed today.
Moving to the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $368 million for Q1. Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $2.1 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for NetLogic of $3.4 billion and our quarterly dividend payment of $55 million. 
Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 38 days in Q1. In addition, net inventory levels increased $54 million from Q4, resulting in 7.7 turns in Q1.
Moving to expectation, we currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be roughly $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Sequential revenue for our Broadband Communications and Infrastructure Networking segment are expected to be up in Q1, while our Mobile & Wireless sales are expected to be roughly flat.
We expect Q2 non-GAAP product gross margins to remain roughly flat versus Q1. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to increase by approximately $35 million to $50 million, of which $35 million comes from the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase and operating expenses from our NetLogic and Broadline acquisitions. Meaning, Broadcom organic expenses are projected to be flat to up $15 million. In addition, stock-based compensation should decrease by $5 million to $10 million.
Finally, despite meaningful revenue estimate revisions to the industry and NetLogic peers in September, much of which NetLogic experienced as well, we currently estimate accretion on a non-GAAP basis for full year 2012 to be between $0.07 and $0.08 per share, helped by a group cost synergies and favorable financing. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

We continue to se",1081,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of Broadband Access Solutions. 
We continue to see solid growth opportunities for our portfolio of broadband products outside of North America. During the quarter, we announced several partnerships in China to deploy Ethernet over Coax, which unites DOCSIS to enable service providers to deploy cost-effective triple play services. We also introduce our latest generation of entry-level cable set-top box platforms to fuel the global migration the HD. 
In developed markets, we see network set-top box and personal content viewing via tablets and smartphones driving demand for next-generation features.
During the quarter, we introduced the industry's first platform enabling secure convergence of PayTV and Internet applications for hybrid gateways. We also announced NAGRA certification for our latest 40 nanometer set-top box platforms, enabling secure delivery of premium content and services to multiple TVs in the home. Our MoCA attach rate continues to rise as customers roll out next-generation network set-top boxes in hybrid gateways.
We also announced the acquisition of BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end to end GPON solutions. BroadLight's solid engineering team will extend our successful broadband access business in the fastest-growing segment, which is PON. Over the next few years, PON subscriber growth is forecast to the about 20% per year. Broadcom is now strongly positioned to offer service providers complete solutions across the access spectrum from DSL to cable to PON. The BroadLight acquisition closed in April and will be included in our Q2 results.  We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be up in Q2, driven by strength in our IP set-top box and broadband access portfolios.
Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure Networking business was up 6% sequentially in Q1. Excluding the $33 million revenue contribution from NetLogic, this segment was down 3% sequentially, better than most of our peers. Softness in the quarter was due to reduced demand for service provider products, partially offset by strength in data center solutions. 
On a full quarter basis, NetLogic's processor revenue grew sequentially in Q1. The acquisition of NetLogic more than doubles our addressable market in infrastructure, while being accretive to non-GAAP gross margins. We're excited about the combination and the integration that is off to a great start. NetLogic employees are actively collaborating with their Broadcom colleagues and they jointly completed multiple tape outs including one in 28 nanometers. I'm also pleased to report that as of this morning, the NetLogic business has completed the transition to our administrative systems.
Over the last few months, we meaningfully expanded our footprint in the service provider market by announcing several powerful new products including a small cell backhaul switch that integrates up to 4 components to drive down system cost and power consumption for next-generation LTE networks; a highly integrated microwave RF chip, which doubles our addressable market in microwave radios; and the industry's first fully programmable 100 gigabit per second full duplex network processor that delivers more than twice the throughput of any other network processor on the market today.
This week, we also made 2 important announcements. The world's highest density scalable 100 Gigabit Ethernet switching solution, which enables the design of switching platforms with densities up to 4,100 gigabit ethernet ports for data center and service provider applications. We also announced our next-generation high-performance stackable enterprise switches with integrated application level visibility and mobility features. 
In the Data Center, our customers started shipping the latest generation of Romley servers, using Broadcom's 10-Gig controllers. We expect to see continued strong demand for 10 gig, 40 gig and now 100 gig switching products throughout the Data Center, which is a multiyear secular trend for our Infrastructure business.
Looking into Q2, we expect our infrastructure revenues to be up, driven by a full quarter of NetLogic and broad strength in Ethernet Switches and Fis, particularly in the service provider and Data Center markets.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment was flat sequentially from Q4, ahead of both seasonality and guidance, driven by strong performance in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. Strength in 3G basebands drove both 3G volume and revenue to crossover 2G in the first quarter, which is ahead of our prior expectations.
Broadcom extended its leadership in 5G Wi-Fi. We were the first to sample in Q4 2011, we were the first announce it in CES in January, the first the demonstrate it over the air, and we were the first to ship production volume to lead customers. Last week, Netgear announced the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi router, powered by Broadcom and available later this month. We are pleased to see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market even earlier than we anticipated and even more pleased to see growth in our ecosystem as we deliver real innovation to the market.
We also broadened our 5G Wi-Fi portfolio in Q1 by introducing solutions for enterprise, cloud, network and carrier customers. We expect to see wide adoption as 5G Wi-Fi is 3x faster, twice the range and 6x more power-efficient than its predecessor. We believe we are 2 to 3 quarters ahead of our competition and look forward to seeing this technology ramp into a broad range of products over the course of the next year.
Finally, we see continued momentum around our NFC solutions. Since we announced our tag and reader solution for smartphones, we have won numerous designs, have received production orders, and we expect to ship to lead customers this quarter.  We expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q2. Our 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessor business will be soft in Q2, without which our Mobile & Wireless business would be up sequentially.
In summary, we see strength across our portfolio in both near-term demand and longer-term design win traction. We are seeing solid growth in 3G, which now represents the majority of our Baseband business. We see a broadband business fueled by subscriber growth in international markets, and network set-top boxes in developed markets. We see an Infrastructure business that can now serve a much larger addressable market.  Broadcom has a strong and broad communications portfolio, and our record design wins in Q1 demonstrate that customers continue to value our ability to lead with innovation.

And instead what we saw considerable strength in our 3G baseband business and they crossed over in the first quarter. We do expect them to continue to grow in the second quarter. So that's one of our growth drivers in the second quarter. We still see some softness in our 2G business, and we expect that to continue to decline over the course of the year. But I think after the second quarter, the headwinds are pretty much gone, and we don't expect to see headwinds in Q3 or Q4. With some customers, for example, like Samsung, we're primarily 3G today. At Nokia, we're 100% 2G, and at this point, we don't expect material revenue from Nokia 3G this year. We expect that will be a 2013 event at this point."

People want to have base stations before they connect the clients. So for us, the announcement of the Netgear client that will ship this month is very important. We see a number of other customers also launching quickly. So we believe the infrastructure will be out there pretty quickly. We expect clients -- you could begin to see those towards the latter part of this year, but that's mostly a next year event. Think of it this year for infrastructure, next year for clients. That's typical with 802.11. But we think that this is a pretty compelling solution, just in terms of the kind of performance improvements you get.

And by and large, we chose to use what's call the HPM process, which came out a little later than some of the processes that other people are using. But we waited because the HPM process tends to have a better figure of merit than the HP or the Poly Psion processes that some of our competitors are using. So when we do come out with 28-nanometer products, they should have better specs, better power performance and whatnot. We have already picked out a number of 28-nanometer chips. We believe we'll see some 28-nanometer revenue this year, but it will be relatively immaterial. Primarily our revenue is on 65 nanometer moving to 40-nanometer most of our tape outs are still 40-nanomerter. And next year, you'll start to see the 28-nanometer revenue ramp but it will still be a minority of our business. And so we are less subject to us some of the initial ramp problems that some of our competitors have had with 28-nanometer in some of the foundries. We do see that 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer often used on shared equipment, which drives a little bit tightness in the 40 nanometer side of the business as people look to get 28-nanometer capacity. But we don't see that as impacting our business. We've been able to get the wafers we need by and large because we have excellent relationships with our foundry partners. And so for us, access to wafers, or pricing or other terms have not been a limiting factor for our business right now."

And we can debate about how much else it includes. But certainly, those pieces I think will become very, very popular to be integrated.

And so smartphones as a percentage of total phones, are going up dramatically, which has a drag-along effect of bringing our combo chips to play there.

Generally, the seasonality is favorable in the second and third quarters, a little falloff in the fourth quarter as people in the third quarter really push hard to build for the holiday season.

Just to give you a sense, on the non-GAAP EPS we reported, the NetLogic contribution in Q1 was neutral. So that $0.65 was really all native Broadcom business, organic Broadcom business. As it plays out for OpEx over the course of the year, and one of the reasons why it broke out the OpEx the way it did, is that we are talking about basically organic OpEx growth of flat to $15 million. If you take the midpoint of that and you look at what we actually performed on the organic component of the Broadcom business, actually we were probably below from a Broadcom perspective many of you have modeled in Q2. Having said that, I think we are becoming a little more comfortable with the spending pattern over the course of the year based on some of the growth trends we're seeing in the business. So broadband's growth into Q2, which is actually stronger by the fact that the decline of the Consumer Electronics business that will actually show some growth, including a decline in the Consumer Electronics business. The fact that Mobile & Wireless was flat in Q1 despite the drop in 2G and seasonally typically being down also reflected some strength in our minds. And again, using some of the guidance or qualitative aspects associated with NetLogic going into Q2, you can see the underlying ING business is also growing into Q2. So we're trying to remain relatively tight. We want to run our business on a product operating margin north of 20%. We were 19.1% this quarter. We'd like to pick that back up.

And so you actually get some standard margin benefit going into Q2. Depending on the mix of the business, Stacy, come over the course of the year, we're not changing our range which is 50 to 52. But I wouldn't be surprised to see us riding around this range and maybe drift off at the end of the year once we wash out some of the older NetLogic parts that were manufactured under their contract and movement to our contract. So there are some tailwinds certainly for NetLogic as it grows over the course of the year. It was only about 20 basis points of tailwind to gross margin this quarter, and it will drift up, we think, closer to the 100 basis points end of this year, beginning of next year."

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize for Q1, total revenue of $1.83 billion; total product revenue of $1.77 billion, including $33 million from NetLogic; Q1 total net revenue, excluding NetLogic, was down 1.4% sequentially and down 1.2% from prior year levels. Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points from Q4 to 52%; Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%; Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $54 million and $89 million, respectively, from Q4 levels; Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65 per share or $0.10 above first call consensus of $0.55; Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15, including $0.13 of acquisition-related charges and $0.12 of onetime adjustments outlined in our earnings release; cash flow from operations for Q1 was $368 million; our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter were $2.1 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 total net revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Excluding NetLogic, we delivered revenue near the top end of that range. Total net revenue ended at $1.83 billion, of which NetLogic contributed $33 million. On a standalone basis, NetLogic total revenue for the first quarter of 2012 would have been $83 million, meaning $50 million pre-acquisition period revenue was not recorded in Broadcom's financial segments.
As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q4, which was better than our normal Q1 seasonal decrease in demand for broadband. Our Mobile & Wireless segments was flat sequentially from Q4 as strength in 3G, basebands and Wi-Fi combos was offset by anticipated softness in 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessors. 
Including NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 6% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was down 3% due to a weakness in the service provider market and a decrease in our controller products.
Our Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points to 52%. This was better than our expectations of roughly flat, driven principally by lower costs and a decrease in the E&O provision during the quarter. Our Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%, driven primarily by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $45 million.
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses for Q1 were up $54 million from Q4 levels, including NetLogic, which is favorable to the guidance provided in January, principally driven by lower employee costs and lower-than-expected legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were $89 million, up from Q4 levels, approximately $24 million related to the NetLogic stock-based compensation assumed in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we recorded settlement costs of $86 million related to patent infringement claims, as well as an impairment of acquisition intangibles of $28 million. We also recorded a onetime non-cash benefit for income taxes of roughly $46 million related to the purchase price accounting associated with the NetLogic transaction. These items are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q filed today.
Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $358 million for Q1. Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $2.1 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for NetLogic of $3.4 billion and our quarterly dividend payment of $55 million. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 38 days in Q1. In addition, net inventory levels increased $54 million from Q4 resulting in 7.7 turns in Q1.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be roughly $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Sequential revenue for our Broadband Communications and Infrastructure & Networking segment are expected to be off in Q1, while our Mobile & Wireless sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q2 non-GAAP product gross margins to remain roughly flat versus Q1. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to increase by approximately $35 million to $50 million, of which $35 million comes from the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase and operating expenses from our NetLogic and BroadLight acquisitions.  Meaning, Broadcom organic expenses are projected to be flat to up $15 million. In addition, stock-based compensation should decrease by $5 million to $10 million. 
Finally, despite meaningful revenue estimate revisions to the industry and NetLogic peers since September, much of which, NetLogic experienced as well. We currently estimate accretion on a non-GAAP basis for full year 2012 to be between $0.07 and $0.08 per share, helped by improved cost synergies and favorable financing. 
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see",1077,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see solid growth opportunities for our portfolio of broadband products outside of North America. During the quarter, we announced several partnerships in China to deploy Ethernet over Coax, which unites PON and DOCSIS to enable service providers to deploy cost-effective triple play services. We also introduced our latest generation of entry-level cable set-top box platforms to fuel the global migration to HD. 
In developed markets, we see network set-top box and personal content viewing via tablets and smartphones, driving demand for next-generation features. During the quarter, we introduced the industry's first platform enabling secure convergence of pay TV and Internet applications for hybrid gateways. We also announced NAGRA certification for our latest 40 nanometer set-top box platforms, enabling secure delivery of premium content and services to multiple TVs in the home. Our MoCA attach rate continues to rise as customers roll out next-generation network set-top boxes in hybrid gateways.
We also announced the acquisition of BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. BroadLight's solid engineering team will extend our successful broadband access business in the fastest-growing segment, which is PON. Over the next few years, PON subscriber growth is forecast to the above 20% per year. Broadcom is now strongly positioned to offer service providers complete solutions across the access spectrum from DSL to cable to PON. The BroadLight acquisition closed in April, and we'll include it in our Q2 results. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be up in Q2, driven by strength in our IP set-top box and broadband access portfolios.
Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was up 6% sequentially in Q1. Excluding the $33 million revenue contribution from NetLogic, this segment was down 3% sequentially, better than most of our peers. Softness in the quarter was due to reduced demand for service provider products, partially offset by strength in data center solutions. 
On a full quarter basis, NetLogic's processor revenue grew sequentially in Q1. The acquisition of NetLogic more than doubles our addressable market in infrastructure, while being accretive to non-GAAP gross margins. We're excited about the combination and the integration is off to a great start. NetLogic employees are actively collaborating with their Broadcom colleagues, and they've jointly completed multiple tape outs, including one in 28 nanometers. I'm also pleased to report that as of this morning, the NetLogic business has completed the transition to our administrative systems.
Over the last few months, we meaningfully expanded our footprint in the service provider market by announcing several powerful new products, including a small cell backhaul switch that integrates up to 4 components to drive down system cost and power consumption for next-generation LTE networks; a highly-integrated microwave RF chip, which doubles our addressable market in microwave radios; and the industry's first fully programmable 100 gigabit per second full duplex network processor that delivers more than twice the throughput of any other network processor on the market today.
This week, we also made 2 important announcements: the world's highest density scalable 100-Gigabit Ethernet switching solution, which enables the design of switching platforms with densities up to 4,100 gigabit Ethernet ports for data center and service provider applications. We also announced our next-generation high-performance stackable enterprise switches with integrated application level visibility and mobility features. 
In the data center, our customers started shipping the latest generation of Romley servers, using Broadcom 10-Gig controllers. We expect to see continued strong demand for 10-gig, 40-gig and now 100-gig switching products throughout the data center, which is a multi-year secular trend for our infrastructure business.
Looking into Q2, we expect our infrastructure revenues to be up, driven by a full quarter of NetLogic and broad strength in Ethernet Switches and Fis [ph], particularly in the service provider and data center markets.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment was flat sequentially from Q4, ahead of both seasonality and guidance, driven by strong performance in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. Strength in 3G basebands drove both 3G volume and revenue to crossover 2G in the first quarter, which is ahead of our prior expectations.
Broadcom extended its leadership in 5G Wi-Fi. We were the first to sample in Q4 2011, we were the first announce it at CES in January, the first the demonstrate it over the air, and we were the first to ship production volume to lead customers. Last week, Netgear announced the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi router, powered by Broadcom and available later this month. We are pleased to see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market even earlier than we anticipated and even more pleased to see growth in our ecosystem as we deliver real innovation to the market.
We also broadened our 5G Wi-Fi portfolio in Q1 by introducing solutions for enterprise, cloud, network and carrier customers. We expect to see wide adoption as 5G Wi-Fi is 3x faster, twice the range and 6x more power-efficient than its predecessor. We believe we're 2 to 3 quarters ahead of our competition and look forward to seeing this technology ramp into a broad range of products over the course of the next year.
Finally, we see continued momentum around our NFC solutions. Since we announced our tag and reader solutions for smartphones, we have won numerous designs, have received production orders, and we expect to ship to lead customers this quarter.  We expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q2. Our 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessor business will be soft in Q2, without which, our Mobile & Wireless business would be up sequentially.
In summary, we see strength across our portfolio in both near-term demand and longer-term design win traction. We are seeing solid growth in 3G, which now represents the majority of our baseband business. We see a broadband business fueled by subscriber growth in international markets and network set-top boxes in developed markets. We see an infrastructure business that can now serve a much larger addressable market. Broadcom has a strong and broad communications portfolio, and our record design wins in Q1 demonstrate that customers continue to value our ability to lead with innovation.
This concludes our prepared comments. And now we're ready for your questions. Jackie, may we have the first question, please?"

So that's one of our growth drivers in the second quarter. We still see some softness in our 2G business, and we expect that to continue to decline over the course of the year. But I think after the second quarter, the headwinds are pretty much gone, and we don't expect to see headwinds in Q3 or Q4. With some customers, for example, like Samsung, we're primarily 3G today. At Nokia, we're 100% 2G, and at this point, we don't expect material revenue from Nokia 3G this year. We expect that will be a 2013 event at this point."

We believe we'll see some 28-nanometer revenue this year, but it will be relatively immaterial. Primarily our revenue is on 65 nanometer moving to 40-nanometer. Most of our tape-outs are still 40-nanomerter. And next year, you'll start to see the 28-nanometer revenue ramp, but it will still be a minority of our business. And so we are less subject to some of the initial ramp problems that some of our competitors have had with 28-nanometer in some of the foundries. We do see that 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer, often used on shared equipment, which drives a little bit of tightness in the 40 nanometer side of the business as people look to get 28-nanometer capacity.

So every single one of our basebands comes with application processors. And so, when we sell a baseband chip, it includes sufficient application processors that they don't need to buy one from anyone else. So that is our strategy going forward. And in fact, frankly, I believe that the concept of a standalone baseband chip is pretty much obsolete over the next couple of years, and people will largely buy an integrated SoCs that cover the combination of baseband and application processor and some other functions, certainly, some of the graphics. And we can debate about how much else it includes. But certainly, those pieces, I think, will become very, very popular to be integrated. And so the answer to your question is, yes, that's an integrated baseband plus application processor that completes the need for those functions for those customers. And it also includes a graphics processor and in many cases, an image processor that handles all of the camera aspects as well."

So that's the combination share gain for us there and penetration. We also see that smartphones are becoming more popular. And so smartphones, as a percentage of total phones, are going up dramatically, which has a drag-along effect of bringing our combo chips into play there. And so I think those are more important factors than the seasonality overall. Generally, the seasonality is favorable in the second and third quarters, a little falloff in the fourth quarter as people in the third quarter really push hard to build for the holiday season. So that would be a seasonal effect. But again, I believe that the penetration and the attach rate will be a more significant driver."

On the non-GAAP EPS we reported, the NetLogic contribution in Q1 was neutral. So that $0.65 was really all native Broadcom business or organic Broadcom business. As it plays out for OpEx over the course of the year, and one of the reasons why I broke out the OpEx the way I did, is that we are talking about basically organic OpEx growth of flat to $15 million. If you take the midpoint of that and you look at what we actually performed on the organic component of the Broadcom business, actually, we would probably be below from a Broadcom perspective what many of have in your models in Q2. Having said that, I think we are becoming a little more comfortable with the spending pattern over the course of the year based on some of the growth trends we're seeing in the business. So broadband's growth into Q2, which is actually stronger by the fact there's a decline of the Consumer Electronics business and it will actually show some growth, including a decline in the Consumer Electronics business. The fact that Mobile & Wireless was flat in Q1 despite the drop in 2G and seasonally typically being down also reflected some strength in our minds. And again, in using some of the guidance or qualitative aspects associated with NetLogic going into Q2, you can see the underlying ING business is also growing into Q2. So we're trying to remain relatively tight. We want to run our business on a product operating margin north of 20%. We were 19.1% this quarter. We'd like to pick that back up. And having said that, I think we're beginning to see some signs where we may be able to spend a little bit higher than we originally anticipated entering this year."

Depending on the mix of the business, Stacy, over the course of the year, we're not changing our range, which is 50 to 52. But I wouldn't be surprised to see us riding around this range and maybe drift up at the end of the year once we wash out some of the older NetLogic parts that were manufactured under their contracts and movement to our contracts.

So I would say that there is some internal movement. Certainly, we are not terribly excited about the aggregate change in the NetLogic business from the middle of last year to now, but I think strategically, all the reasons we bought the business remain, and we're encouraged by the fact that it appears to us that as much as they've experienced some of the things their peers have, it looks like less, in fact, than many of your peers, which would indicate to us that they are, in fact, gaining share of the markets that they're in.

We also reported stronger earnings and gross margins than we anticipated due to solid product cost improvements and expense discipline. We're off to a strong start in 2012. 
We have many exciting business updates to talk about later today. We've extended our lead in 5G Wi-Fi, and we've seen solid growth in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. We introduced new broadband platforms for international and developed markets and also meaningfully expanded the addressable market for our infrastructure solutions. These accomplishments led to record design wins across all 3 segments in Q1, which is an important sign of strength for our business.

Please note that we do not anticipate breaking out this information in the future. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize for Q1, total revenue of $1.83 billion; total product revenue of $1.77 billion, including $33 million from NetLogic; Q1 total net revenue, excluding NetLogic, was down 1.4% sequentially and down 1.2% from prior year levels. Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points from Q4 to 52%; Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%; Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $54 million and $89 million, respectively, from Q4 levels; Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65 per share or $0.10 above first call consensus of $0.55; Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15, including $0.13 of acquisition-related charges and $0.12 of onetime adjustments outlined in our earnings release; cash flow from operations for Q1 was $368 million; our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 total net revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Excluding NetLogic, we delivered revenue near the top end of that range. Total net revenue ended at $1.83 billion, of which NetLogic contributed $33 million. On a standalone basis, NetLogic total revenue for the first quarter of 2012 would have been $83 million, meaning $50 million pre-acquisition period revenue was not recorded in Broadcom's financial statements.
As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q4, which was better than our normal Q1 seasonal decrease in demand for broadband. Our Mobile & Wireless segments was flat sequentially from Q4 as strength in 3G, basebands and Wi-Fi combos was offset by anticipated softness in 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessors. 
Including NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 6% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was down 3% due to a weakness in the service provider market and a decrease in our controller products.
Our Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points to 52%. This was better than our expectations of roughly flat, driven principally by lower costs and a decrease in the E&O provision during the quarter. Our Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%, driven primarily by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $45 million.
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses for Q1 were up $54 million from Q4 levels, including NetLogic, which is favorable to the guidance provided in January, principally driven by lower employee costs and lower-than-expected legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were $89 million, up from Q4 levels, approximately $24 million related to the NetLogic stock-based compensation assumed in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we recorded settlement costs of $86 million related to patent infringement claims, as well as an impairment of acquisition intangibles of $28 million. We also recorded a onetime non-cash benefit for income taxes of roughly $46 million related to the purchase price accounting associated with the NetLogic transaction. These items are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q filed today.
Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $368 million for Q1. Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $2.1 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for NetLogic of $3.4 billion and our quarterly dividend payment of $55 million. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 38 days in Q1. In addition, net inventory levels increased $54 million from Q4 resulting in 7.7 turns in Q1.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be roughly $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Sequential revenue for our Broadband Communications and Infrastructure & Networking segment are expected to be up in Q1, while our Mobile & Wireless sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q2 non-GAAP product gross margins to remain roughly flat versus Q1. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to increase by approximately $35 million to $50 million, of which $35 million comes from the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase and operating expenses from our NetLogic and BroadLight acquisitions.  Meaning, Broadcom organic expenses are projected to be flat to up $15 million. In addition, stock-based compensation should decrease by $5 million to $10 million. 
Finally, despite meaningful revenue estimate revisions to the industry and NetLogic peers since September, much of which, NetLogic experienced as well. We currently estimate accretion on a non-GAAP basis for full year 2012 to be between $0.07 and $0.08 per share, helped by improved cost synergies and favorable financing. 
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see",1077,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see solid growth opportunities for our portfolio of broadband products outside of North America. During the quarter, we announced several partnerships in China to deploy Ethernet over Coax, which unites PON and DOCSIS to enable service providers to deploy cost-effective triple play services. We also introduced our latest generation of entry-level cable set-top box platforms to fuel the global migration to HD. 
In developed markets, we see network set-top box and personal content viewing via tablets and smartphones, driving demand for next-generation features. During the quarter, we introduced the industry's first platform enabling secure convergence of pay TV and Internet applications for hybrid gateways. We also announced NAGRA certification for our latest 40 nanometer set-top box platforms, enabling secure delivery of premium content and services to multiple TVs in the home. Our MoCA attach rate continues to rise as customers roll out next-generation network set-top boxes in hybrid gateways.
We also announced the acquisition of BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. BroadLight's solid engineering team will extend our successful broadband access business in the fastest-growing segment, which is PON. Over the next few years, PON subscriber growth is forecast to the above 20% per year. Broadcom is now strongly positioned to offer service providers complete solutions across the access spectrum from DSL to cable to PON. The BroadLight acquisition closed in April, and we'll include it in our Q2 results. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be up in Q2, driven by strength in our IP set-top box and broadband access portfolios.
Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was up 6% sequentially in Q1. Excluding the $33 million revenue contribution from NetLogic, this segment was down 3% sequentially, better than most of our peers. Softness in the quarter was due to reduced demand for service provider products, partially offset by strength in data center solutions. 
On a full quarter basis, NetLogic's processor revenue grew sequentially in Q1. The acquisition of NetLogic more than doubles our addressable market in infrastructure, while being accretive to non-GAAP gross margins. We're excited about the combination and the integration is off to a great start. NetLogic employees are actively collaborating with their Broadcom colleagues, and they've jointly completed multiple tape outs, including one in 28 nanometers. I'm also pleased to report that as of this morning, the NetLogic business has completed the transition to our administrative systems.
Over the last few months, we meaningfully expanded our footprint in the service provider market by announcing several powerful new products, including a small cell backhaul switch that integrates up to 4 components to drive down system cost and power consumption for next-generation LTE networks; a highly-integrated microwave RF chip, which doubles our addressable market in microwave radios; and the industry's first fully programmable 100 gigabit per second full duplex network processor that delivers more than twice the throughput of any other network processor on the market today.
This week, we also made 2 important announcements: the world's highest density scalable 100-Gigabit Ethernet switching solution, which enables the design of switching platforms with densities up to 4,100 gigabit Ethernet ports for data center and service provider applications. We also announced our next-generation high-performance stackable enterprise switches with integrated application level visibility and mobility features. 
In the data center, our customers started shipping the latest generation of Romley servers, using Broadcom 10-Gig controllers. We expect to see continued strong demand for 10-gig, 40-gig and now 100-gig switching products throughout the data center, which is a multi-year secular trend for our infrastructure business.
Looking into Q2, we expect our infrastructure revenues to be up, driven by a full quarter of NetLogic and broad strength in Ethernet Switches and FI's [ph], particularly in the service provider and data center markets.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment was flat sequentially from Q4, ahead of both seasonality and guidance, driven by strong performance in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. Strength in 3G basebands drove both 3G volume and revenue to crossover 2G in the first quarter, which is ahead of our prior expectations.
Broadcom extended its leadership in 5G Wi-Fi. We were the first to sample in Q4 2011, we were the first announce it at CES in January, the first the demonstrate it over the air, and we were the first to ship production volume to lead customers. Last week, Netgear announced the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi router, powered by Broadcom and available later this month. We are pleased to see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market even earlier than we anticipated and even more pleased to see growth in our ecosystem as we deliver real innovation to the market.
We also broadened our 5G Wi-Fi portfolio in Q1 by introducing solutions for enterprise, cloud, network and carrier customers. We expect to see wide adoption as 5G Wi-Fi is 3x faster, twice the range and 6x more power-efficient than its predecessor. We believe we're 2 to 3 quarters ahead of our competition and look forward to seeing this technology ramp into a broad range of products over the course of the next year.
Finally, we see continued momentum around our NFC solutions. Since we announced our tag and reader solutions for smartphones, we have won numerous designs, have received production orders, and we expect to ship to lead customers this quarter.  We expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q2. Our 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessor business will be soft in Q2, without which, our Mobile & Wireless business would be up sequentially.
In summary, we see strength across our portfolio in both near-term demand and longer-term design win traction. We are seeing solid growth in 3G, which now represents the majority of our baseband business. We see a broadband business fueled by subscriber growth in international markets and network set-top boxes in developed markets. We see an infrastructure business that can now serve a much larger addressable market. Broadcom has a strong and broad communications portfolio, and our record design wins in Q1 demonstrate that customers continue to value our ability to lead with innovation.
This concludes our prepared comments. And now we're ready for your questions. Jackie, may we have the first question, please?"

And instead, what we saw is considerable strength in our 3G baseband business, and they crossed over in the first quarter. We do expect them to continue to grow in the second quarter. So that's one of our growth drivers in the second quarter. We still see some softness in our 2G business, and we expect that to continue to decline over the course of the year. But I think after the second quarter, the headwinds are pretty much gone, and we don't expect to see headwinds in Q3 or Q4. With some customers, for example, like Samsung, we're primarily 3G today. At Nokia, we're 100% 2G, and at this point, we don't expect material revenue from Nokia 3G this year. We expect that will be a 2013 event at this point."

They'll decline eventually to 0 over the course of the year into the first part of next year. But again, just the magnitude of them is small enough that it won't provide the headwind. And because they're relatively small in magnitude, that gives us the confidence that the headwind will abate. We're not just sort of hoping they hold up.

But we waited because the HPM process tends to have a better figure of merit than the HP or the Poly/SiON processes that some of our competitors are using. So when we do come out with 28-nanometer products, they should have better specs, better power performance and whatnot. We have already taped out a number of 28-nanometer chips. We believe we'll see some 28-nanometer revenue this year, but it will be relatively immaterial. Primarily our revenue is on 65 nanometer moving to 40-nanometer. Most of our tape-outs are still 40-nanometer. And next year, you'll start to see the 28-nanometer revenue ramp, but it will still be a minority of our business. And so we are less subject to some of the initial ramp problems that some of our competitors have had with 28-nanometer in some of the foundries. We do see that 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer, often used on shared equipment, which drives a little bit of tightness in the 40 nanometer side of the business as people look to get 28-nanometer capacity. But we don't see that as impacting our business. We've been able to get the wafers we need by and large because we have excellent relationships with our foundry partners. And so for us, access to wafers or pricing or other terms have not been a limiting factor for our business right now."

On the non-GAAP EPS we reported, the NetLogic contribution in Q1 was neutral. So that $0.65 was really all native Broadcom business or organic Broadcom business. As it plays out for OpEx over the course of the year, and one of the reasons why I broke out the OpEx the way I did, is that we are talking about basically organic OpEx growth of flat to $15 million. If you take the midpoint of that and you look at what we actually performed on the organic component of the Broadcom business, actually, we would probably be below from a Broadcom perspective what many of have in your models in Q2. Having said that, I think we are becoming a little more comfortable with the spending pattern over the course of the year based on some of the growth trends we're seeing in the business. So broadband's growth into Q2, which is actually stronger by the fact there's a decline of the Consumer Electronics business and it will actually show some growth, including a decline in the Consumer Electronics business. The fact that Mobile & Wireless was flat in Q1 despite the drop in 2G and seasonally typically being down also reflected some strength in our minds. And again, using some of the guidance or qualitative aspects associated with NetLogic going into Q2, you can see the underlying ING business is also growing into Q2. So we're trying to remain relatively tight. We want to run our business on a product operating margin north of 20%. We were 19.1% this quarter. We'd like to pick that back up.

We have quite a few new announcements of new products in the fabric space, network processors, all kinds of things. So I would say our competitiveness of products is probably higher than it's ever been. The Romley rollout has basically standardized on 10 gig. And so we see that driving servers to 10 gig, and so we believe the people will move quickly to 10 gig and in aggregation, use 40 and 100 gig as well. So it's a multi-year secular trend, I think, to move towards the faster networking speeds. And we're very well set up to have best-in-class products for both the enterprise customers and the data centers, as well as the service providers who are going to take advantage of a lot of that.

And that the flat gross margin in this quarter removes that benefit of the E&O. And so you actually get some standard margin benefit going into Q2. Depending on the mix of the business, Stacy, over the course of the year, we're not changing our range, which is 50 to 52. But I wouldn't be surprised to see us riding around this range and maybe drift up at the end of the year once we wash out some of the older NetLogic parts that were manufactured under their contracts and moved to our contracts. So there are some tailwinds certainly for NetLogic as it grows over the course of the year. It was only about 20 basis points of tailwind to gross margin this quarter, and it will drift up, we think, closer to the 100 basis points end of this year, beginning of next year."

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview, to summarize for Q1, total revenue of $1.83 billion; total product revenue of $1.77 billion, including $33 million from NetLogic; Q1 total net revenue, excluding NetLogic, was down 1.4% sequentially and down 1.2% from prior year levels. Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points from Q4 to 52%; Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%; Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $54 million and $89 million, respectively, from Q4 levels; Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.65 per share or $0.10 above first call consensus of $0.55; Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15, including $0.13 of acquisition-related charges and $0.12 of onetime adjustments outlined in our earnings release; cash flow from operations for Q1 was $368 million; our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 total net revenue to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Excluding NetLogic, we delivered revenue near the top end of that range. Total net revenue ended at $1.83 billion, of which NetLogic contributed $33 million. On a standalone basis, NetLogic total revenue for the first quarter of 2012 would have been $83 million, meaning $50 million pre-acquisition period revenue was not recorded in Broadcom's financial statements.
As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was down 3% from Q4, which was better than our normal Q1 seasonal decrease in demand for broadband. Our Mobile & Wireless segments was flat sequentially from Q4 as strength in 3G, basebands and Wi-Fi combos was offset by anticipated softness in 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessors. 
Including NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 6% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was down 3% due to a weakness in the service provider market and a decrease in our controller products.
Our Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 150 basis points to 52%. This was better than our expectations of roughly flat, driven principally by lower costs and a decrease in the E&O provision during the quarter. Our Q1 GAAP product gross margin was 48.1%, driven primarily by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $45 million.
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses for Q1 were up $54 million from Q4 levels, including NetLogic, which is favorable to the guidance provided in January, principally driven by lower employee costs and lower-than-expected legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q1 were $89 million, up from Q4 levels, approximately $24 million related to the NetLogic stock-based compensation assumed in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we recorded settlement costs of $86 million related to patent infringement claims, as well as an impairment of acquisition intangibles of $28 million. We also recorded a onetime non-cash benefit for income taxes of roughly $46 million related to the purchase price accounting associated with the NetLogic transaction. These items are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q filed today.
Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $368 million for Q1. Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $2.1 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for NetLogic of $3.4 billion and our quarterly dividend payment of $55 million. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 38 days in Q1. In addition, net inventory levels increased $54 million from Q4 resulting in 7.7 turns in Q1.
Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be roughly $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Sequential revenue for our Broadband Communications and Infrastructure & Networking segment are expected to be up in Q1, while our Mobile & Wireless sales are expected to be roughly flat. We expect Q2 non-GAAP product gross margins to remain roughly flat versus Q1. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q2 to increase by approximately $35 million to $50 million, of which $35 million comes from the full quarter impact of our annual merit increase and operating expenses from our NetLogic and BroadLight acquisitions.  Meaning, Broadcom organic expenses are projected to be flat to up $15 million. In addition, stock-based compensation should decrease by $5 million to $10 million. 
Finally, despite meaningful revenue estimate revisions to the industry and NetLogic peers since September, much of which, NetLogic experienced as well. We currently estimate accretion on a non-GAAP basis for full year 2012 to be between $0.07 and $0.08 per share, helped by improved cost synergies and favorable financing. 
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see",1077,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue decreased 3% sequentially, which is ahead of our normal Q1 seasonal decline in this segment, driven by strength in sales of broadband access solutions. We continue to see solid growth opportunities for our portfolio of broadband products outside of North America. During the quarter, we announced several partnerships in China to deploy Ethernet over Coax, which unites PON and DOCSIS to enable service providers to deploy cost-effective triple play services. We also introduced our latest generation of entry-level cable set-top box platforms to fuel the global migration to HD. 
In developed markets, we see network set-top box and personal content viewing via tablets and smartphones, driving demand for next-generation features. During the quarter, we introduced the industry's first platform enabling secure convergence of pay TV and Internet applications for hybrid gateways. We also announced NAGRA certification for our latest 40 nanometer set-top box platforms, enabling secure delivery of premium content and services to multiple TVs in the home. Our MoCA attach rate continues to rise as customers roll out next-generation network set-top boxes in hybrid gateways.
We also announced the acquisition of BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. BroadLight's solid engineering team will extend our successful broadband access business in the fastest-growing segment, which is PON. Over the next few years, PON subscriber growth is forecast to the above 20% per year. Broadcom is now strongly positioned to offer service providers complete solutions across the access spectrum from DSL to cable to PON. The BroadLight acquisition closed in April, and we'll include it in our Q2 results. We expect revenue from our Broadband Communications business to be up in Q2, driven by strength in our IP set-top box and broadband access portfolios.
Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking business was up 6% sequentially in Q1. Excluding the $33 million revenue contribution from NetLogic, this segment was down 3% sequentially, better than most of our peers. Softness in the quarter was due to reduced demand for service provider products, partially offset by strength in data center solutions. 
On a full quarter basis, NetLogic's processor revenue grew sequentially in Q1. The acquisition of NetLogic more than doubles our addressable market in infrastructure, while being accretive to non-GAAP gross margins. We're excited about the combination and the integration is off to a great start. NetLogic employees are actively collaborating with their Broadcom colleagues, and they've jointly completed multiple tape outs, including one in 28 nanometers. I'm also pleased to report that as of this morning, the NetLogic business has completed the transition to our administrative systems.
Over the last few months, we meaningfully expanded our footprint in the service provider market by announcing several powerful new products, including a small cell backhaul switch that integrates up to 4 components to drive down system cost and power consumption for next-generation LTE networks; a highly-integrated microwave RF chip, which doubles our addressable market in microwave radios; and the industry's first fully programmable 100 gigabit per second full duplex network processor that delivers more than twice the throughput of any other network processor on the market today.
This week, we also made 2 important announcements: the world's highest density scalable 100-Gigabit Ethernet switching solution, which enables the design of switching platforms with densities up to 4,100 gigabit Ethernet ports for data center and service provider applications. We also announced our next-generation high-performance stackable enterprise switches with integrated application level visibility and mobility features. 
In the data center, our customers started shipping the latest generation of Romley servers, using Broadcom 10-Gig controllers. We expect to see continued strong demand for 10-gig, 40-gig and now 100-gig switching products throughout the data center, which is a multi-year secular trend for our infrastructure business.
Looking into Q2, we expect our infrastructure revenues to be up, driven by a full quarter of NetLogic and broad strength in Ethernet Switches and FI's [ph], particularly in the service provider and data center markets.
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment was flat sequentially from Q4, ahead of both seasonality and guidance, driven by strong performance in 3G basebands and Wi-Fi combos. Strength in 3G basebands drove both 3G volume and revenue to crossover 2G in the first quarter, which is ahead of our prior expectations.
Broadcom extended its leadership in 5G Wi-Fi. We were the first to sample in Q4 2011, we were the first announce it at CES in January, the first the demonstrate it over the air, and we were the first to ship production volume to lead customers. Last week, Netgear announced the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi router, powered by Broadcom and available later this month. We are pleased to see 5G Wi-Fi coming to market even earlier than we anticipated and even more pleased to see growth in our ecosystem as we deliver real innovation to the market.
We also broadened our 5G Wi-Fi portfolio in Q1 by introducing solutions for enterprise, cloud, network and carrier customers. We expect to see wide adoption as 5G Wi-Fi is 3x faster, twice the range and 6x more power-efficient than its predecessor. We believe we're 2 to 3 quarters ahead of our competition and look forward to seeing this technology ramp into a broad range of products over the course of the next year.
Finally, we see continued momentum around our NFC solutions. Since we announced our tag and reader solutions for smartphones, we have won numerous designs, have received production orders, and we expect to ship to lead customers this quarter.  We expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q2. Our 2G baseband and multimedia coprocessor business will be soft in Q2, without which, our Mobile & Wireless business would be up sequentially.
In summary, we see strength across our portfolio in both near-term demand and longer-term design win traction. We are seeing solid growth in 3G, which now represents the majority of our baseband business. We see a broadband business fueled by subscriber growth in international markets and network set-top boxes in developed markets. We see an infrastructure business that can now serve a much larger addressable market. Broadcom has a strong and broad communications portfolio, and our record design wins in Q1 demonstrate that customers continue to value our ability to lead with innovation.
This concludes our prepared comments. And now we're ready for your questions. Jackie, may we have the first question, please?"

So that's one of our growth drivers in the second quarter. We still see some softness in our 2G business, and we expect that to continue to decline over the course of the year. But I think after the second quarter, the headwinds are pretty much gone, and we don't expect to see headwinds in Q3 or Q4. With some customers, for example, like Samsung, we're primarily 3G today. At Nokia, we're 100% 2G, and at this point, we don't expect material revenue from Nokia 3G this year. We expect that will be a 2013 event at this point."

We believe we'll see some 28-nanometer revenue this year, but it will be relatively immaterial. Primarily our revenue is on 65 nanometer moving to 40-nanometer. Most of our tape-outs are still 40-nanometer. And next year, you'll start to see the 28-nanometer revenue ramp, but it will still be a minority of our business. And so we are less subject to some of the initial ramp problems that some of our competitors have had with 28-nanometer in some of the foundries. We do see that 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer, often used on shared equipment, which drives a little bit of tightness in the 40 nanometer side of the business as people look to get 28-nanometer capacity.

As you look at the NetLogic business and, of course, as you expand your service provider business, what is your sense as to when, in aggregate, spending will resume? and in trying to answer that, if you can also provide some additional color as to what's happening now in terms of spending and what you think will happen as the year progresses?"

We do see those stabilizing, and I think it does have some regional variation. I think certainly China came in weaker than expected, but anecdotally, that's said to improve. I think recent press releases from 2 of the largest service providers in North America recently have talked to increased capital spending as they rollout a variety of their both wireline, as well as wireless infrastructure. So we do see service providers stabilizing and believe that will be an improving trend over the course of the year, where it has been weak for the last couple of quarters."

And we can debate about how much else it includes. But certainly, those pieces, I think, will become very, very popular to be integrated.

And so smartphones, as a percentage of total phones, are going up dramatically, which has a drag-along effect of bringing our combo chips into play there.

Generally, the seasonality is favorable in the second and third quarters, a little falloff in the fourth quarter as people in the third quarter really push hard to build for the holiday season.

On the non-GAAP EPS we reported, the NetLogic contribution in Q1 was neutral. So that $0.65 was really all native Broadcom business or organic Broadcom business. As it plays out for OpEx over the course of the year, and one of the reasons why I broke out the OpEx the way I did, is that we are talking about basically organic OpEx growth of flat to $15 million. If you take the midpoint of that and you look at what we actually performed on the organic component of the Broadcom business, actually, we would probably be below from a Broadcom perspective what many of have in your models in Q2. Having said that, I think we are becoming a little more comfortable with the spending pattern over the course of the year based on some of the growth trends we're seeing in the business. So broadband's growth into Q2, which is actually stronger by the fact there's a decline of the Consumer Electronics business and it will actually show some growth, including a decline in the Consumer Electronics business. The fact that Mobile & Wireless was flat in Q1 despite the drop in 2G and seasonally typically being down also reflected some strength in our minds. And again, using some of the guidance or qualitative aspects associated with NetLogic going into Q2, you can see the underlying ING business is also growing into Q2. So we're trying to remain relatively tight. We want to run our business on a product operating margin north of 20%. We were 19.1% this quarter. We'd like to pick that back up.

But I wouldn't be surprised to see us riding around this range and maybe drift up at the end of the year once we wash out some of the older NetLogic parts that were manufactured under their contracts and moved to our contracts.

Non-GAAP earnings per share were up more than 10% sequentially consistent with our focus of outgrowing the market while driving leverage through the P&L. Broadcom grows faster than the broader semiconductor industry for several reasons: First, our end markets are growing faster than the broader industry due to strong secular trends such as new PON subscribers, data center buildout and smartphone adoption; second we're gaining share in several key markets, including communications processors, 3G basebands wireless connectivity and broadband access. Finally, Broadcom is seeing growth in content through platform due to our expanding IP portfolio, our integrated platform approach and the trends for more advanced networking features in the home in infrastructure.

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement our financial commentary. Moving to the financial review. To summarize for Q2, total revenue of $1.97 billion, including product revenue of $1.92 billion. Q2 total net revenue was up 7.9% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year. Excluding the full quarter impact of acquisition, net revenue was up approximately 5% sequentially from prior year levels. Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%. Q2 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $38 million and $28 million respectively from Q1 level. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72 or $0.05 above first call consensus of $0.67. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.28 per share, including $0.24 of acquisition-related and nonrecurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $349 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Moving to revenue and gross margin. In May, we said we expected Q2 total net revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2 billion. We delivered revenue of the top end of the range at $1.97 billion. As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was up 10% from Q1, principally driven by growth in sales of broadband modems partially offset by the anticipated decline in Blu-ray and DTV. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was up 3% from Q1, which is better than expected primarily due to wireless connectivity. Including the full quarter impact of NetLogic, revenue from our infrastructure and networking segment increased 18% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was up approximately 6% driven principally by growth in switching products. Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. This was slightly better than our expectations at roughly flat. Our Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%, a decline from Q1 levels principally driven by increased in acquisition-related charges of roughly $40 million. Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $38 million from Q1 level, including the full quarter impact of our acquisitions and our annual merit increase, which is at the low end of our guidance provided in May due to lower-than-expected facilities/IT costs and legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $28 million from Q1 level. Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $349 million for Q2. Cash and marketable securities ended Q2 with $2.2 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for BroadLight  of $179 million and our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million. Our accounts receivables day sales outstanding was 38 days in Q2. In addition, inventory turns were flat at 7.7 turns in Q2. Finally moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q3 to be roughly $2 billion, to $2.15 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be up from Q2 for our broadband segment, up slightly for our infrastructure and networking segment and up significantly for our Mobile & Wireless segment. We expect Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q2. We expect Q3 product gross margin -- GAAP product gross margin to increase by roughly 200 basis points versus Q2 due to an anticipated reduction in acquisition-related charges primarily inventory step-up. In addition, we expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q3 to be up approximately $5 million to $20 million. We expect that GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q3 to be roughly flat. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Broadband access con",976,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, Broadband Communications revenue increased nearly 10% sequentially driven by strong growth in broadband access solutions for both cable operators and telecommunications service providers. Broadband access continues to deliver a meaningful growth for Broadcom. Our portfolio of complete solutions across cable, DSL and PON enable us to benefit from the entire broadband deployment cycle. We're gaining share globally and seeing richer content in next-generation residential gateways. Additionally were benefiting from favorable secular drivers such as the transition to DOCSIS 3.0 and vDSL too. These terms has delivered solid year-over-year growth of over 20% for our broadband access business. During the quarter, we closed a fully integrated broad like, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. The combination of our existing GPON business with BroadLight makes up the leading supplier of PON solutions in the market. Customer feedback has been positive and given our company product portfolio we're well-positioned to expand our customer base and benefit from solid PON subscriber growth rates, which are forecasted to grow in excess of 35% annually over the next several years. Turning to set-top box, we believe that demand is accelerating into the second half of this year. In developed markets, we see continued share gains accelerated adoption of network set-top boxes and the ramp of new technologies, including full band capture. Outside of Europe and North America, Pay TV subscribers are forecasted to grow more than 20% annually over the next several years providing long-term growth opportunity for our set-top box business. Looking into Q3, we expect Broadband Communications revenue to be up driven primarily by growth in our set-top box business. Moving to infrastructure, our infrastructure and networking revenue was up 18% sequentially in Q2. Excluding NetLogic, our infrastructure business was up roughly 6% quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by growth in Ethernet switch and in the service provider enterprise and SMB end markets. We made several new product announcements in Q2. We announced the industry's first family of network SoCs that delivered gigabit conductivity 45G Wi-Fi SMB and home networks supporting the gigabit wireless rates to 5G Wi-Fi can achieve. We also announced industries lowest our highest performance family of 100 gigabit Ethernet multi-rater gearbox 5. The low power architecture of these products anticipates 2.5 watts per port enabling power savings in excess of 35%. These 5 simplified optical modules and lower platform cost and enabling next-generation optics and what ultimately driving 100 gigabit Ethernet into mainstream data center enterprise and core networks. We are seeing solid design wins for our portfolio of multi-core, multithreaded and embedded processors. During the second quarter, we shipped a wide variety of XLP products and ranging from cost-effective single threaded control plane processors to the highest and multichip solution supporting 128 coherent threads. Our XLP customer base continues to expand with new design wins in LTE base stations, Layer 4 to Layer 7 services cards, layer 7 security appliances and for control plane processors supporting Broadcom's switches and network processors. We look to this trend a pretty continue into the second half of 2012. Looking into Q 3, we expect our infrastructure revenue to be up slightly across all end markets. Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment revenue was up 3% sequentially as growth in Wi-Fi combos and 3G basebands more than offset the anticipated softness in 3G basebands in multimedia coprocessors. Mobile & Wireless results were a solid and ahead of guidance due to stronger-than-expected growth in our this conductivity. Several significant smartphone launches in Q2 meaningfully expanded our 3G baseband business. First, we saw continuing momentum at Samsung, with several news single sim and dual-sim Android handsets introduce globally. Second, we saw the launch of the TCL W989, which is shipping into China Unicom. In addition, Vodafone launched their latest Vodafone device the Smart 2 across affective 3G and great smartphone that's shipping globally. This market and it was would've want to convert existing feature phones users to their first smartphone. This momentum enabled us to gain share in 3G basebands in Q2. During the quarter, we also received production orders from our 40-nanometer single-core and dual-core basebands with ramps expected in the second half of 2012. These basebands are part of Broadcom snacks generation cellular platform, which includes our industry-leading wireless conductivity, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC. Momentum continues to build around the 5G Wi-Fi ecosystem. New product announcements in Q2 included access points from Cisco, Netgear, Buffalo and D-Link and the industry's  first 5G Wi-Fi laptop from Asus. We extended our portfolio with today's announcements of our fifth-generation wireless combo chip the, 4335. The 4335 combines 5G Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.0 and FM and build on a franchise that is shipped to over 1 billion wireless combo chips today. The 4345 Broadcom's robust software suite and extends our industry-leading wireless coexistence technology to LTE, thereby delivering a high performance low-power solution for next-generation mobile devices. The 4335 has sample to multiple customers. We expect initial shipments around the end of the year and a meaningful ramp in early 2013. Finally we shift our NFC reader to lead customers in Q2 and expect continued growth in NFC in the second half of this year as our customers products come to market. Looking forward, we expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be up significantly going into Q3 driven by wireless connectivity as we are in the vast majority of wireless consumer devices for the holiday season. In summary, our results and guidance continue to demonstrate Broadcom's ability to grow faster than the overall semiconductor industry while driving leverage through the P&L. We continue to benefit from powerful secular trends, continued share gains and a steady increase in content per platform. This concludes our prepared comments and we're now ready for your questions.

So in fact, the fact that we're actually holding gross margin flat in the face of such strength in Mobile & Wireless, we think is a good sign for our gross margin in general."

We're definitely seeing in terms of regions, we're seeing weakness in Europe. We're seeing some of the tenders come back in China that has softened up a little bit. We are seeing some of those come back now so I think that will reflect into product sales in the second half of this year. In the United States, certainly we're seeing some of the CapEx spend from some of the larger guys. Again, second half greater than first half trend, which helps there. You asked about small sales, we're very bullish on small sales and it's a very natural combination with our products because we can provide the combination of the last mile technology and what And what we normally do in DSL or a gateway product. We can add that to make that a very competitive, attractive product. So we're very bullish on small sales to the total volume of that shipping right now is not particularly high but you've probably seen a number of the forecast showing that's a pretty rapid growth of business going forward. The real problem it solves is that carriers now are all struggling to deal with the bandwidth issues by limited spectrum and there are 2 ways that the carriers saw the limited spectrum issue. One is to go through smaller cells where we're set up to participate strongly and the other is to offload to Wi-Fi which with our 5G Wi-Fi infrastructure offerings and handset offerings, we've got really good product in that space. So we're great partner to help them with the spectrum overload they have now, both in current products this up 5G Wi-Fi, over the next course of the next year or 2 with small cells and over the next year or 2 also the base station that we talked about before in the ING business."

The actual semiconductor component of that is fairly small. If you break out our Ethernet products that sell into that same segments, we've seen roughly the same growth rates and opportunities as that of other companies. So we all so enjoy growth in that market and expect certainly as the storage market and as a broader market continues to go, we'll see benefit there. In infinite tiem, they typically have a faster product with 56 gig and as Ethernet goes to 100 gig, it's really going to pick up some speed benefit that was a disadvantage in the past. In general, Ethernet over the years has evolved to really provide and open solution to a lot of the problems that people use proprietary technologies for in the past and so I think that will give us a lot of advantages going forward."

Broadcom performed well in the June quarter with revenue at the high end of the guided range and earnings above both our prior expectations and Wall Street consensus. Q2 revenue was a record $1.97 billion, which was up nearly 8% sequentially. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up more than 10% sequentially, consistent with our focus of outgrowing the market while driving leverage through the P&L. Broadcom grows faster than the broader semiconductor industry for several reasons: First, our end markets are growing faster than the broader industry due to strong secular trends such as new PON subscribers, data center buildouts and smartphone adoption; second, we're gaining share in several key markets, including communications processors, 3G basebands, wireless connectivity and broadband access. Finally, Broadcom is seeing growth in content per platform due to our expanding IP portfolio, our integrated platform approach and the trend to more advanced networking features in the home and in infrastructure. I'll go over these trends in more detail later, but let me first turn the call over to Eric for details on the second quarter financial results and third quarter guidance. Eric?"

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q2, total revenue of $1.97 billion, including product revenue of $1.92 billion. Q2 total net revenue was up 7.9% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year. Excluding the full quarter impact of acquisition, net revenue was up approximately 5% sequentially from prior year levels. Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%. Q2 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $38 million and $28 million, respectively, from Q1 level. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72 or $0.05 above first call consensus of $0.67. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.28 per share, including $0.24 of acquisition-related and nonrecurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $349 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Moving to revenue and gross margin. In May, we said we expected Q2 total net revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2 billion. We delivered revenue at the top end of the range at $1.97 billion. As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was up 10% from Q1, principally driven by growth in sales of broadband modems, partially offset by the anticipated decline in Blu-ray and DTV. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was up 3% from Q1, which is better than expected, primarily due to wireless connectivity. Including the full quarter impact of NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 18% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was up approximately 6%, driven principally by growth in switching products. Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. This was slightly better than our expectations at roughly flat. Our Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%, a decline from Q1 levels principally driven by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $40 million. Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $38 million from Q1 levels, including the full quarter impact of our acquisitions and our annual merit increase, which is at the low end of our guidance provided in May due to lower-than-expected facilities/IT costs and legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $28 million from Q1 level. Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $349 million for Q2. Cash and marketable securities ended Q2 with $2.2 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for BroadLight  of $179 million and our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million. Our accounts receivables day sales outstanding was 38 days in Q2. In addition, inventory turns were flat at 7.7 turns in Q2. Finally, moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q3 to be roughly $2 billion to $2.15 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be up from Q2 for our Broadband segment, up slightly for our Infrastructure & Networking segment and up significantly for our Mobile & Wireless segment. We expect Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q2. We expect Q3 product gross margin -- GAAP product gross margin to increase by roughly 200 basis points versus Q2 due to an anticipated reduction in acquisition-related charges, primarily inventory step-up. In addition, we expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q3 to be up approximately $5 million to $20 million. We expect GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q3 to be roughly flat. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."
136333,212812207,329801,"Broadcom Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, Broadband Communications revenue increased nearly 10% sequentially, driven by strong growth in broadband access solutions for both cable operators and telecommunications service providers. Broadband access co",969,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, Broadband Communications revenue increased nearly 10% sequentially, driven by strong growth in broadband access solutions for both cable operators and telecommunications service providers. Broadband access continues to deliver meaningful growth for Broadcom. Our portfolio of complete solutions across cable, DSL and PON enable us to benefit from the entire broadband deployment cycle. We're gaining share globally and seeing richer content in next-generation residential gateways. Additionally, we're benefiting from favorable secular drivers such as the transitions to DOCSIS 3.0 and vDSL2. These trends have delivered solid year-over-year growth of over 20% for our broadband access business. During the quarter, we closed and fully integrated BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. The combination of our existing GPON business with BroadLight makes us the leading supplier of PON solutions in the market. Customer feedback has been positive and given our complete product portfolio, we're well positioned to expand our customer base and benefit from solid PON subscriber growth rates, which are forecasted to grow in excess of 25% annually over the next several years. Turning to set-top box, we believe that demand is accelerating into the second half of this year. In developed markets, we see continued share gains, accelerated adoption of network set-top boxes and the ramp of new technologies, including full band capture. Outside of Europe and North America, pay-TV subscribers are forecasted to grow more than 20% annually over the next several years, providing a long-term growth opportunity for our set-top box business. Looking into Q3, we expect Broadband Communications revenue to be up driven primarily by growth in our set-top box business. Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was up 18% sequentially in Q2. Excluding NetLogic, our Infrastructure business was up roughly 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by growth in Ethernet switch and PHY in the service provider enterprise and SMB end markets. We made several new product announcements in Q2. We announced the industry's first family of network SoCs that deliver high bandwidth gigabit conductivity for 5G Wi-Fi SMB and home networks, supporting the gigabit wireless rates that 5G Wi-Fi can achieve. We also announced the industry's lowest power, highest performance family of 100 gigabit Ethernet multi-rate gearbox PHYs. The low-power architecture of these products anticipates 2.5 watts per port, enabling power savings in excess of 35%. These PHYs simplify optical modules and lower platform costs, enabling next-generation optics and ultimately driving 100 gigabit Ethernet into mainstream data center enterprise and core networks. We are seeing solid design wins for our portfolio of multi-core, multi-threaded and embedded processors. During the second quarter, we shipped a wide variety of XLP products ranging from cost-effective single-threaded control plane processors to the highest end multichip solution supporting 128 coherent threads. Our XLP customer base continues to expand with new design wins in LTE base stations, Layer 4 to Layer 7 services cards, Layer 7 security appliances and for control plane processors supporting Broadcom's switches and network processors. We look for these trends to continue into the second half of 2012. Looking into Q3, we expect our Infrastructure revenue to be up slightly across all end markets. Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment revenue was up 3% sequentially as growth in Wi-Fi combos and 3G basebands more than offset the anticipated softness in 3G basebands and multimedia coprocessors. Mobile & Wireless results were solid and ahead of guidance due to stronger-than-expected growth in wireless connectivity. Several significant smartphone launches in Q2 meaningfully expanded our 3G baseband business. First, we saw continuing momentum at Samsung, with several new single sim and dual-sim Android handsets introduced globally. Second, we saw the launch of the TCL W989, which is shipping into China Unicom. In addition, Vodafone launched their latest Vodafone-branded device, the Smart II, a cost-effective 3G Android smartphone that's shipping globally. The Smart II enables Vodafone to convert existing feature phone users to their first smartphone. This momentum enabled us to gain share in 3G basebands in Q2. During the quarter, we also received production orders for our 40-nanometer, single-core and dual-core basebands with ramps expected in the second half of 2012. These basebands are part of Broadcom's next-generation cellular platform that includes our industry-leading wireless connectivity, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC. Momentum continues to build around the 5G Wi-Fi ecosystem. New product announcements in Q2 included access points from Cisco, NETGEAR, Belkin, Buffalo and D-Link and the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi laptop from Asus. We extended our portfolio with today's announcement of our fifth-generation wireless combo chip, the 4335 [BCM4335]. The 4335 combines 5G Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.0 and FM, and builds on a franchise that is shipped to over 1 billion wireless combo chips to date. The 4335 leverages Broadcom's robust software suite and extends our industry-leading wireless coexistence technology to LTE, thereby delivering a high-performance, low-power solution for next-generation mobile devices. The 4335 has sampled to multiple customers. We expect initial shipments around the end of the year and a meaningful ramp in early 2013. Finally, we shipped our NFC reader to lead customers in Q2 and expect continued growth in NFC in the second half of this year as our customers' products come to market. Looking forward, we expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be up significantly going into Q3, driven by wireless connectivity as we are in the vast majority of wireless consumer devices for the holiday season. In summary, our results and guidance continue to demonstrate Broadcom's ability to grow faster than the overall semiconductor industry, while driving leverage to the P&L. We continue to benefit from powerful secular trends, continued share gains and a steady increase in content per platform. This concludes our prepared comments and we're now ready for your questions. Ellen, may we have the first question, please?"

In terms of the transition from 65 to 40, roughly 70% of our business was at 65 this quarter. Actually, it was the first quarter really began to dip down, 40 has -- is approaching 10% and growing.

I think one of the drivers we certainly saw was strength in service providers. And that surprised us a little bit. We expected to see a little more strength in data centers and less in service providers, but it was the latter. So one of the things, we think, is driving that is I think people widely reported that service provider CapEx is roughly flat year-over-year last year into this year. But if you look at it from first half to second half of this year, it's steeper increase first half to second half than it was last year, and definitely growing first half to second half. So I think that's driving some of the service provider spend there that reflects into our infrastructure products. We're definitely seeing -- in terms of regions, we're seeing weakness in Europe. We're seeing some of the tenders come back in China that had softened up a little bit. We're seeing a couple of those come back now. So I think that will reflect into product sales in the second half of this year. In the United States, certainly, we're seeing some of the CapEx spend from some of the larger guys. Again, a second half greater than first half trend, which helps there. You asked about small cells. We're very bullish on small cells and it's a very natural combination with our products because we can provide the combination of the last mile technology and what we normally do in a DSL or a gateway product. We can add that and make that a very competitive, attractive product. So we're very bullish on small cells. The total volume of that shipping right now is not particularly high, but you've probably seen a number of the forecast showing that's a pretty rapid growth business going forward. The real problem it solves is that carriers now are all struggling to deal with the bandwidth issues by limited spectrum. And there are 2 ways that the carriers saw the limited spectrum issue. One is to go to smaller cells, where we're set up to participate strongly, and the other is to offload to Wi-Fi, which with our 5G Wi-Fi infrastructure offerings and handset offerings, we've got really good product in that space. So we're a great partner to help them with the spectrum overload they have now, both in current products with 5G Wi-Fi over the next course of the next year or 2 with small cells, and then over the course of the next year or 2 also on the base station that we talked about before in the ING [ph] business."

And so I think that will give us a lot of advantages going forward."

Non-GAAP earnings per share were up more than 10% sequentially, consistent with our focus of outgrowing the market while driving leverage through the P&L.

Finally, Broadcom is seeing growth in content per platform due to our expanding IP portfolio, our integrated platform approach and the trend to more advanced networking features in the home and in infrastructure.

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investors section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q2, total revenue of $1.97 billion, including product revenue of $1.92 billion. Q2 total net revenue was up 7.9% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year. Excluding the full quarter impact of acquisitions, net revenue was up approximately 5% sequentially from prior year levels. Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%. Q2 non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $38 million and $28 million, respectively, from Q1 level. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72 or $0.05 above first call consensus of $0.67. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.28 per share, including $0.24 of acquisition-related and nonrecurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $349 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Moving to revenue and gross margin. In May, we said we expected Q2 total net revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2 billion. We delivered revenue at the top end of the range at $1.97 billion. As anticipated, our Broadband Communications segment was up 10% from Q1, principally driven by growth in sales of broadband modems, partially offset by the anticipated decline in Blu-ray and DTV. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was up 3% from Q1, which is better than expected, primarily due to wireless connectivity. Including the full quarter impact of NetLogic, revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment increased 18% sequentially. Excluding NetLogic, this segment was up approximately 6%, driven principally by growth in switching products. Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was up 20 basis points from Q1 to 52.2%. This was slightly better than our expectations at roughly flat. Our Q2 GAAP product gross margin was 46.7%, a decline from Q1 levels principally driven by an increase in acquisition-related charges of roughly $40 million. Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $38 million from Q1 levels, including the full quarter impact of our acquisitions and our annual merit increase, which is at the low end of our guidance provided in May due to lower-than-expected facilities/IT costs and legal fees in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses for Q2 were up $28 million from Q1 level. Moving to the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow from operations was $349 million for Q2. Cash and marketable securities ended Q2 with $2.2 billion. This reflects the net cash payment for BroadLight  of $179 million and our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million. Our accounts receivables day sales outstanding was 38 days in Q2. In addition, inventory turns were flat at 7.7 turns in Q2. Finally, moving to expectations, we currently expect net revenue in Q3 to be roughly $2 billion to $2.15 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be up from Q2 for our Broadband segment, up slightly for our Infrastructure & Networking segment and up significantly for our Mobile & Wireless segment. We expect Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin to remain roughly flat versus Q2. We expect Q3 product gross margin -- GAAP product gross margin to increase by roughly 200 basis points versus Q2 due to an anticipated reduction in acquisition-related charges, primarily inventory step-up. In addition, we expect non-GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses in Q3 to be up approximately $5 million to $20 million. We expect GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q3 to be roughly flat. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Broadband access co",967,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, Broadband Communications revenue increased nearly 10% sequentially, driven by strong growth in broadband access solutions for both cable operators and telecommunications service providers. Broadband access continues to deliver meaningful growth for Broadcom. Our portfolio of complete solutions across cable, DSL and PON enable us to benefit from the entire broadband deployment cycle. We're gaining share globally and seeing richer content in next-generation residential gateways. Additionally, we're benefiting from favorable secular drivers such as the transitions to DOCSIS 3.0 and vDSL2. These trends have delivered solid year-over-year growth of over 20% for our broadband access business. During the quarter, we closed and fully integrated BroadLight, a provider of highly integrated end-to-end GPON solutions. The combination of our existing GPON business with BroadLight makes us the leading supplier of PON solutions in the market. Customer feedback has been positive and given our complete product portfolio, we're well positioned to expand our customer base and benefit from solid PON subscriber growth rates, which are forecasted to grow in excess of 25% annually over the next several years. Turning to set-top box, we believe that demand is accelerating into the second half of this year. In developed markets, we see continued share gains, accelerated adoption of network set-top boxes and the ramp of new technologies, including full band capture. Outside of Europe and North America, pay-TV subscribers are forecasted to grow more than 20% annually over the next several years, providing a long-term growth opportunity for our set-top box business. Looking into Q3, we expect Broadband Communications revenue to be up driven primarily by growth in our set-top box business. Moving to Infrastructure, our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was up 18% sequentially in Q2. Excluding NetLogic, our Infrastructure business was up roughly 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by growth in Ethernet switch and PHY in the service provider enterprise and SMB end markets. We made several new product announcements in Q2. We announced the industry's first family of network SoCs that deliver high bandwidth gigabit conductivity for 5G Wi-Fi, SMB and home networks, supporting the gigabit wireless rates that 5G Wi-Fi can achieve. We also announced the industry's lowest power, highest performance family of 100 gigabit Ethernet multi-rate gearbox PHYs. The low-power architecture of these products dissipates 2.5 watts per port, enabling power savings in excess of 35%. These PHYs simplify optical modules and lower platform costs, enabling next-generation optics and ultimately driving 100 gigabit Ethernet into mainstream data center enterprise and core networks. We are seeing solid design wins for our portfolio of multi-core, multi-threaded and embedded processors. During the second quarter, we shipped a wide variety of XLP products ranging from cost-effective single-threaded control plane processors to the highest end multichip solution supporting 128 coherent threads. Our XLP customer base continues to expand with new design wins in LTE base stations, Layer 4 to Layer 7 services cards, Layer 7 security appliances and for control plane processors supporting Broadcom's switches and network processors. We look for these trends to continue into the second half of 2012. Looking into Q3, we expect our Infrastructure revenue to be up slightly across all end markets. Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless segment revenue was up 3% sequentially as growth in Wi-Fi combos and 3G basebands more than offset the anticipated softness in 2G basebands and multimedia coprocessors. Mobile & Wireless results were solid and ahead of guidance due to stronger-than-expected growth in wireless connectivity. Several significant smartphone launches in Q2 meaningfully expanded our 3G baseband business. First, we saw continuing momentum at Samsung, with several new single-SIM and dual-SIM Android handsets introduced globally. Second, we saw the launch of the TCL W989, which is shipping into China Unicom. In addition, Vodafone launched their latest Vodafone-branded device, the Smart II, a cost-effective 3G Android smartphone that's shipping globally. The Smart II enables Vodafone to convert existing feature phone users to their first smartphone. This momentum enabled us to gain share in 3G basebands in Q2. During the quarter, we also received production orders for our 40-nanometer, single-core and dual-core basebands with ramps expected in the second half of 2012. These basebands are part of Broadcom's next-generation cellular platform that includes our industry-leading wireless connectivity, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC. Momentum continues to build around the 5G Wi-Fi ecosystem. New product announcements in Q2 included access points from Cisco, NETGEAR, Belkin, Buffalo and D-Link and the industry's first 5G Wi-Fi laptop from Asus. We extended our portfolio with today's announcement of our fifth-generation wireless combo chip, the 4335 [BCM4335]. The 4335 combines 5G Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.0 and FM, and builds on a franchise that has shipped over 1 billion wireless combo chips to date. The 4335 leverages Broadcom's robust software suite and extends our industry-leading wireless coexistence technology to LTE, thereby delivering a high-performance, low-power solution for next-generation mobile devices. The 4335 has sampled to multiple customers. We expect initial shipments around the end of the year and a meaningful ramp in early 2013. Finally, we shipped our NFC reader to lead customers in Q2 and expect continued growth in NFC in the second half of this year as our customers' products come to market. Looking forward, we expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be up significantly going into Q3, driven by wireless connectivity as we are in the vast majority of wireless consumer devices for the holiday season. In summary, our results and guidance continue to demonstrate Broadcom's ability to grow faster than the overall semiconductor industry, while driving leverage through the P&L. We continue to benefit from powerful secular trends, continued share gains and a steady increase in content per platform. This concludes our prepared comments and we're now ready for your questions. Ellen, may we have the first question, please?"

In the longer term, I think it'll be sort of a question of can they turn that business into something that's competitive with Broadcom, with a fairly small number of employees, it's not particularly advanced technology, and I think we've demonstrated over the last 5 years that doing good, well-integrated, technically performing combo products is harder than it seems. And so if we continue to innovate and keep doing good products, I don't expect it will affect us in the long term."

Now having said that, I think that we're comfortable and now more comfortable than we certainly were a couple of years ago, both due to cost reductions that we've seen in 65 and with the growth of Mobile & Wireless to be able to maintain our gross margins in the targeted range and maybe even at that top end or slightly above that range. In terms of the transition from 65 to 40, roughly 70% of our business was at 65 this quarter. Actually, it was the first quarter really began to dip down, 40 has -- is approaching 10% and growing. So I expect you'll see a number of new products hitting the market in 40 going forward through the back half of this year and into next year as 40 begins to grow in a significant part of our business. And as Scott mentioned, even in the set-top box area, where one of the places we're going to see some growth in Q3, you have some new 40-nanometer products that really drive increased content and functionality for the customer and I think do well from a margin perspective for us."

I think one of the drivers we certainly saw was strength in service providers. And that surprised us a little bit. We expected to see a little more strength in data centers and less in service providers, but it was the latter. So one of the things, we think, is driving that is I think people have widely reported that service provider CapEx is roughly flat year-over-year last year into this year. But if you look at it from first half to second half of this year, it's steeper increase first half to second half than it was last year, and definitely growing first half to second half. So I think that's driving some of the service provider spend there that reflects into our infrastructure products. We're definitely seeing -- in terms of regions, we're seeing weakness in Europe. We're seeing some of the tenders come back in China that had softened up a little bit. We're seeing a couple of those come back now. So I think that will reflect into product sales in the second half of this year. In the United States, certainly, we're seeing some of the CapEx spend from some of the larger guys. Again, a second half greater than first half trend, which helps there. You asked about small cells. We're very bullish on small cells and it's a very natural combination with our products because we can provide the combination of the last mile technology and what we would normally do in a DSL or a gateway product. We can add that and make that a very competitive, attractive product. So we're very bullish on small cells. The total volume of that shipping right now is not particularly high, but you've probably seen a number of the forecasts showing that's a pretty rapid growth business going forward. The real problem it solves is that carriers now are all struggling to deal with the bandwidth issues by limited spectrum. And there are 2 ways that the carriers saw the limited spectrum issue. One is to go to smaller cells, where we're set up to participate strongly, and the other is to offload to Wi-Fi, which with our 5G Wi-Fi infrastructure offerings and handset offerings, we've got really good product in that space. So we're a great partner to help them with the spectrum overload they have now, both in current products with 5G Wi-Fi over the next course of the next year or 2 with small cells, and then over the course of the next year or 2 also on the base station that we talked about before in the ING [ph] business."

So we also enjoy growth in that market and expect, certainly, as the storage market and as the broader market continues to go, we'll see benefit there. They -- in Infiniband, they typically have a faster product with 56 GB, and as Ethernet goes to 100 GB, it's really going to pick up some speed benefit that was a disadvantage in the past.

And so a couple percent movement in there can swamp growth or changes in some of the other businesses. But that being said, we are ramping with new customers that are not in the phone space that could drive some significant volume. I can't say much more than that right now, but we'll say more on that maybe in the next quarter call. But you should see some other things coming to market. So in terms of share gain opportunities, we've kicked out some other competitors with these new customers as they ramp on those things. So that will definitely help us there. In terms of opportunity for ASP expansion with ac, absolutely yes. There could be a 2x or 3x expansion in the ASP based on exactly what product they were using and the configuration and so forth, but it is an ASP improvement. It's a much more sophisticated product and complexity in silicon, but the performance is substantially better and we do get a premium for that."

I'm pleased to report quarterly revenue, record revenue record cash flow from operations and model profitability in the September quarter.

Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q",594,"Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor Relations section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q3, total record revenue of $2.13 billion, including product revenue of $2.08 billion. Q3 total net revenue was up 8% sequentially and 8.7% year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin was 52.1%. Q3 GAAP product gross margin was 48.8%. Non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $28 million and $21 million respectively from Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 or $0.02 above first call consensus of $0.77 per share. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.38 per share, including $0.21 of acquisition-related non-recurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was a record $621 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. 
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In July, we said that we expected Q3 total net revenue to be $2 billion to $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue at the upper end of the range at $2.13 billion. The Broadband Communications segment was up a bit less than expected, increasing 2.6% from Q2 principally driven by growth in sales of set-top box platforms. Revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment was a bit stronger than anticipated, increasing 5.2% sequentially driven principally by stronger than expected sales of switching products. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was up 13.7% from Q2 to a record $1.02 billion, which was slightly higher than anticipated driven primarily by strength in wireless connectivity.
Non-GAAP product gross margin was down 10 basis points from Q2 to 52.1%. This was consistent with our expectations of roughly flat. Our Q3 GAAP product gross margin was up 210 basis points from Q2 to 48.8%, consistent with our expectations driven primarily by a decrease in inventory step-up of $36 million resulting from the sell-through of inventory assumed in our acquisition of NetLogic. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q3 were up $28 million from Q2 levels, which is above the high-end of our guidance provided in July principally due to a true-up accrual for incentive compensation as a result of the company's improved relative performance versus our peers. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses were up $21 million from Q2 levels. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q3 at $3.2 billion. This reflects our quarterly record cash flow from operations of $621 million. The net proceeds of our debt offering of $492 million, our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million and a small amount of share repurchases in the quarter. For the quarter, our accounts receivables day sales outstanding was 37 days in Q3 and net inventory turns were 7.6. 
Finally, moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q4 to be roughly $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be roughly flat to Q3 for the broadband segment, down for our Infrastructure & Networking segment and down slightly for our Mobile & Wireless segment. We expect Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to be flat to up slightly with GAAP gross margin improving slightly more due to the continued reduction in acquisition-related inventory step up. In addition, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q4 to be flat to up $15 million. 
and now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business"

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in our set-top box business. Forward secular trends and Broadcom innovations continue to fuel our set-top box business. In devel",1077,"Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in our set-top box business. Forward secular trends and Broadcom innovations continue to fuel our set-top box business. In developed markets we see increasing concept for platform as customers ramp next-generation products with more tuners, more transcoding and additional networking technologies, including MoCA, powerline and WiFi, for example, our MoCA attach rate to cable set-top box platforms has more than quadrupled over the last year. In September, we strengthened our security and content protection offerings with the announcement of NAGRA OpenTV 5 support across cable, satellite and IP set-top boxes and gateways. When this is combined with integrated NAGRA on-chip security, operators can securely deploy complementary, over-the-top services to more devices throughout the home. Outside of Europe and North America, we see share gains and continued growth in pay TV subscribers. For example, we recently announced industry's first dual ISDB-T chipset for Digital Terrestrial TV in Latin America. This 40-nanometer solution enables our customers to reduce board space and lower cost of addressed a large and rapidly expanding physical terrestrial TV in Latin America. 
Moving to our broadband access business, we've seen meaningful growth across DSL, pond and cable modem over the past year. Our DOCSIS 3.0 mix has grown by over 40% year-over-year and now represents more than 2/3 of our cable modem business. We also announced the integration of 5G WiFi on our DOCSIS 3.0 and VDSL gateway platforms, enabling our customers to accelerate their ramp of whole home coverage for subscribers. In DSL, we're driving veteran technology for central office deployments, which doubles capacity by removing cross talk interference. As announced by and Alcatel Lucent last week, we look for large scale customer trials with VDSL2 vectoring technology by the end of this year. 
Looking into Q4, we expect our Broadband Communications revenue to be flat and strength in set-top boxes is being offset by the nearly concluded rollout of our legacy Blu-ray and DTV businesses.
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was up 5% sequentially in Q3 driven by growth in Ethernet switch, thigh and multicore processors. During the quarter, we extended our leadership in Ethernet switching for the data center with the introduction of Trident II, which is the world's highest density switch chips. We have 4.8 billion transistors on a single-chip, Trident II delivers more than 110 gigabit Ethernet ports or up to 32, 40 gig gigabit ports and is optimized for software defined networks and cloud-scale data centers supporting tens of thousands of servers and virtual machines Trident II is sampling now and will be adopted in data center networks in 2013.
We also expanded our product portfolio with the introduction of the world's first 28-nanometer communications processor family, the XLP 200 series delivers best in class core performance enabled by Quad issue, quad threading and 2 gigahertz out of order execution with security acceleration technologies. And moving to 28-nanometer, the XLP 200 series delivers up to 400% greater performance while at the same time consuming up to 60% less power. The XLP 200 series is sampling now and expected to wrap next year.
Finally, our announcement with Hyundai is the most recent example of a major automotive manufacturer engaging with Broadcom to deploy Ethernet in advanced driver assist systems, Telematics and infotainment. Moving on our relationship with industry leaders like BMW, our broader reach technology has been standardized and promoted by the OPEN Alliance, which has grown to more than 80 members over the last year. While we're still in the early stages of this opportunity, automotive is expanding the addressable market for Ethernet. We expect our infrastructure revenue to be down sequentially in Q4 driven by softness in data center and enterprise spending as well as continued softness in service provider capital expenditures. 
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless revenue grew by almost 14% sequentially to a record $1.02 billion driven by solid growth in wireless connectivity. Our connectivity business grew faster than our overall Mobile & Wireless business and came in ahead of our expectations. Outside of the quarter was driven by customers building a broad range of new devices in advance of the holiday season. Sequential growth in connectivity was driven by both improved mix and share gains in China. Amazon launched the Kindle Fire HD, which introduced 2 by 2 Wi-Fi tablet to increase connection speeds up to 40%. This smartphones are also increasingly embracing dual band Wi-Fi to leverage the 5 gigahertz band for higher-speed and improves signal reliability. In China, our combos are increasingly being found in cost-effective smartphones, this richer mix and broad geographic footprint highlights the value of a complete portfolio of connectivity products. We also saw strength in 5G Wi-Fi, GPS and NFC. We're pleased with the ramp of 5G Wi-Fi across multiple device categories. We have more than $100 million of orders for our mobile 5G Wi-Fi solutions today and production orders have just begun to ship. Our 3G baseband business also grew sequentially in Q3, driven by our highly integrated SoCs that address the growing global demand for affordable smartphones. T-Mobile introduced the conqueror smartphone, which is the first 3G smartphone based on the complete Broadcom platform selling in the North American market. Samsung also announced new Android Ice Cream Sandwich devices based on our latest single core, 40-nanometer platform. When compared to our prior generation, this new solutions includes enhanced multimedia acceleration and doubles the processor performance. We expect to see more products coming to market through the rest of the year, including powerful smartphones leveraging our 40-nanometer dual core HSPA+ platform. Looking into Q4, we expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be down slightly due to seasonality and some better-than-expected sell in as a result of customer product launches during Q3. 
In summary, our product roadmap and design win traction are stronger than ever. We continue to bring best-in-class products to market while delivering fully integrated platforms to help customers get to market quickly. While we may see some variation in our business in the short term due to macroeconomic conditions, Broadcom is extremely well-positioned for the future. Our relentless engineering focus, combined with our leadership position in the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor industry continue to position us well for meaningful long-term outperformance.

Is the combo connectivity that is not secure, you obviously saw the benefits of your combo ramp with many of your customer introductions in the third quarter, but I'm just wondering if things like, for example, 802.11ac rollout of some of your router-based customers are taking a slight pause here as well."

So it will typically be shipped by us in Q3, assembled in the modules and delivered to customers in late Q3 into Q4. So that tends to shift our peak a little more into Q3 than you would see from others. So that accounts for some of the seasonality. We also have a little bit of our 2G business continuing to fall off. That's a little bit of a headwind. That's becoming fairly small that will essentially go to near 0 next year so that will diminish very quickly. On the positive side, we have things 5G Wi-Fi continued penetration and new 3G basebands coming out.

First of all, on the incentive true-up, the way -- and it's published by the way in our proxies, the way our incentive compensation work is on relative performance. In the first quarter, we were outperforming our peers roughly on a weighted average bit about 300 basis points. In Q2, that number was up close to 500 basis points and in Q3, that number is close to 800 basis points and the nature of the way you book these things is, if we really thought we were going to outperform in Q3 by that much, we would've booked it earlier in the year and so because the acceleration from Q2 to Q3 was as significant as it was, a triggered that true-up of incentive compensation such that through Q3 on a year-to-date basis, we're actually outperforming our peers by roughly 600 basis points. And that is pretty significant when you're talking about an industry that's growing somewhere around 0 or actually below 0 for many of our peers. So that does catch up in Q3. That does not roll into Q4. You're correct in a sense that it should not roll into Q4 because you're catching up Qs 1 and 2 into Q3. What's driving Q4 is actually a pretty significant step up in design and development, which you can read into that as masks cost and engineering costs associated with mass, as we move more and more products into dedicated 40-nanometer products for production and even 28-nanometer products on dedicated mass. In fact, in Q3 over 85% of the masks that we did were 40-nanometer and below and 10% of the masks we did were 28-nanometer and below so that's really what's driving the OpEx delta into Q4. I wish I could give you a better picture but I can only get a sense of how we're going to do in the next quarter based on how our peers report and guide guidance the next quarter and it's a very incomplete picture when we close our books certainly. And then your second point on Emulex, we booked about $1.5 million to past damages and about $2 million on an ongoing basis to the royalty line."

Certainly if you look at the growth, it's principally in the R&D line and year-over-year, let's just a number that you've got in the non-GAAP financials, about $90 million. If you take that $90 million, probably somewhere around $20 million of that is just wrapped around the fact from the decisions we made in the prior year, so now you're down to about $70 million. And if you take that $70 million, it's probably split between or close to equally between the step up associated with the acquisition of NetLogic into P&L and an increase in our investments in LTE. Philosophically, in terms of how we're managing, we're trying to manage the company between 20% to 22% product operating income on a non-GAAP basis. This quarter, we were 21%. So we're trying to manage within that. Having said that, I think the biggest challenge for the industry is the relatively low growth in 2011 and 2012. And I've said before that I think that the inherent inflation in R&D without increasing headcount resources or tape out is probably in the vicinity, 3% to 5%. And so for us, we're growing slightly faster. We do have a pick up because of some changes, principally driven acquisition in an investment in LTE. Beyond that, we are making significant changes to the infrastructure of our R&D spend and I suspect that, that won't change meaningfully into next year as well and we're trying to manage that sort of that if we see a reasonable growth here, we'll actually see the leverage come back through the P&L and grow revenue faster than operating expenses."

It's interesting, we have processors across Broadcom in almost every one of our businesses, in our broadband group, in our networking group and our mobile group, and more and more we've got the opportunity to get the processors experts together. It's kind of interesting because in the NetLogic acquisition, we have processors that are at the extreme end of anything that any of our competitors do, whereas in the mobile space, you're former focus on power consumption and finding the right balance is important and I think we've got the expertise in the company to do performance and power management and that's the real key. One of the things that you have to be careful of is, it's very easy to do a processor of any speed you want. The question is, what will be the power consumption when you do that? So it would be no problem at all for us to announce a processor that's faster than any of our competitors but then the question is, what's the balance in terms of battery life and other things.

If ING, as I mentioned, is in Q4, usually down a little bit, it's usually about flattish in Q1 now. I think that's really driven much more by the rate of adoption in terms of the data center customers and the rate at which the providers start to build out CapEx and I think some of Verizon's commentary is probably been fairly sobering provider space and then as I mentioned in Mobile & Wireless, it's down about 5% typically in Q1. So I can standard deviations on these things are 8 to 10 points. So the standard deviation is much larger than the actual results but that does give you a picture of what we normally see. In terms of inventory step up, Q4 should be the end of any material number. We stepped down about $36 million in Q3. It is about $6 million, $7 million left, we'll probably wipe out most of that in Q4 and I think off from a GAAP perspective, other than the amortization, which stays at the level it's been at relatively consistently, it will be pretty much where it is for on a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment unless there's another acquisition that we do."

We're pleased to report quarterly revenue -- record revenue, record cash flow from operations and model profitability in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $2.13 billion, which was up 8% sequentially and at the high end of the guided range. Q3 was the first quarter in the company's history exceeding $2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 were up 10% over Q2, and cash flow from operations was a record $621 million. 
All 3 of our businesses grew in Q3. Mobile & Wireless grew almost 14% sequentially and crossed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. We continue to see strong demand for connectivity solutions, while our 3G baseband business continues to grow with the ramp of our latest 40-nanometer platforms. 
Despite a challenging economic environment, we're benefiting from multiple attractive secular themes, including increasing WiFi attach rates, exponential growth in network traffic and strong adoption of high-definition cable and satellite solutions in emerging markets. 
This quarter, we introduced industry's highest density, [indiscernible] Bragg switch and the industry's first 28-nanometer multicore communications processors. Broadcom's technology innovation has created a product portfolio that's stronger than ever and drives growth from new product cycles going forward.

Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q",593,"Thanks, Scott. As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor Relations section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q3, total record revenue of $2.13 billion, including product revenue of $2.08 billion. Q3 total net revenue was up 8% sequentially and 8.7% year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin was 52.1%. Q3 GAAP product gross margin was 48.8%. Non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $28 million and $21 million, respectively, from Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 or $0.02 above First Call Consensus of $0.77 per share. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.38 per share, including $0.21 of acquisition-related and non-recurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was a record $621 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. 
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In July, we said that we expected Q3 total net revenue to be $2 billion to $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue at the upper end of the range at $2.13 billion. The Broadband Communications segment was up a bit less than expected, increasing 2.6% from Q2 principally driven by growth in sales of set-top box platforms. Revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment was a bit stronger than anticipated, increasing 5.2% sequentially driven principally by stronger-than-expected sales of switching products. Our Mobile & Wireless segment was up 13.7% from Q2 to a record $1.02 billion, which was slightly higher than anticipated driven primarily by strength in wireless connectivity.
Non-GAAP product gross margin was down 10 basis points from Q2 to 52.1%. This was consistent with our expectations of roughly flat. Our Q3 GAAP product gross margin was up 210 basis points from Q2 to 48.8%, consistent with our expectations, driven primarily by a decrease in inventory step-up of $36 million resulting from the sell-through of inventory assumed in our acquisition of NetLogic. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q3 were up $28 million from Q2 levels, which is above the high end of our guidance provided in July principally due to a true-up accrual for incentive compensation as a result of the company's improved relative performance versus our peers. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses were up $21 million from Q2 levels. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q3 at $3.2 billion. This reflects our quarterly record cash flow from operations of $621 million, the net proceeds of our debt offering of $492 million, our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million and a small amount of share repurchases in the quarter. For the quarter, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 37 days in Q3, and net inventory turns were 7.6. 
Finally, moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q4 to be roughly $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be roughly flat to Q3 for the Broadband segment, down for our Infrastructure & Networking segment and down slightly for our Mobile & Wireless segment. We expect Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to be flat to up slightly with GAAP gross margin improving slightly more due to the continued reduction in acquisition-related inventory step-up. In addition, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q4 to be flat to up $15 million. 
and now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business"

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in our set-top box business. Solid secular trends and Broadcom innovations continue to fuel our set-top box business. In developed markets, we see increasing content for platform as customers ramp next-generation products with more tuners, more transcoding and additional networking technologies, including MoCA, powerline and WiFi. For example, our MoCA attach rate to cable set-top box platforms has more than quadrupled over the last year. 
In September, we strengthened our security and content protection offerings with the announcement of NAGRA OpenTV 5 support across cable, satellite and IP set-top boxes and gateways. When this is combined with integrated NAGRA On-chip Security, operators can securely deploy complementary, over-the-top services to more devices throughout the home. 
Outside of Europe and North America, we see share gains and continued growth in pay TV subscribers. For example, we recently announced the industry's first dual ISDB-T chipset for digital terrestrial TV in Latin America. This 40-nanometer solution enables our customers to reduce board space and lower costs to address the large and rapidly expanding digital terrestrial TV market in Latin America. 
Moving to our broadband access business, we've seen meaningful growth across DSL, PON and cable modem over the past year. Our DOCSIS 3.0 mix has grown by over 40% year-over-year and now represents more than 2/3 of our cable modem business. We also announced the integration of 5G WiFi on our DOCSIS 3.0 and VDSL gateway platforms, enabling our customers to accelerate their ramp of whole home coverage for subscribers. In DSL, we're driving vectoring technology for central office deployments, which doubles capacity by removing cross-talk interference. As announced by Belgacom and Alcatel-Lucent last week, we look for large-scale customer trials with VDSL2 vectoring technology by the end of this year. 
Looking into Q4, we expect our Broadband Communications revenue to be flat as strength in set-top boxes is being offset by the nearly concluded rollout of our legacy Blu-ray and DTV businesses.
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was up 5% sequentially in Q3 driven by growth in Ethernet switch, PHY and multicore processors. During the quarter, we extended our leadership in Ethernet switching for the data center with the introduction of Trident II, which is the world's highest-density switch chip. With 4.8 billion transistors on a single chip, Trident II delivers more than 110-gigabit Ethernet ports or up to 32 40-gigabit ports and is optimized for software-defined networks and cloud-scale data centers, supporting tens of thousands of servers and virtual machines. Trident II is sampling now and will be adopted in data center networks in 2013.
We also expanded our product portfolio with the introduction of the world's first 28-nanometer communications processor family. The XLP 200-Series delivers best-in-class core performance enabled by quad issue, quad threading and 2-gigahertz out-of-order execution with security acceleration technologies. And moving to 28-nanometer, the XLP 200-Series delivers up to 400% greater performance while, at the same time, consuming up to 60% less power. The XLP 200-Series is sampling now and expected to ramp next year.
Finally, our announcement with Hyundai is the most recent example of a major automotive manufacturer engaging with Broadcom to deploy Ethernet in advanced driver assist systems, telematics and infotainment. Building on our relationship with industry leaders like BMW, our BroadR-Reach technology has been standardized and promoted by the OPEN Alliance, which has grown to more than 80 members over the last year. While we're still in the early stages of this opportunity, automotive is expanding the addressable market for Ethernet. 
We expect our Infrastructure revenue to be down sequentially in Q4 driven by softness in data center and enterprise spending as well as continued softness in service provider capital expenditures. 
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile & Wireless revenue grew by almost 14% sequentially to a record $1.02 billion driven by solid growth in wireless connectivity. Our connectivity business grew faster than our overall Mobile & Wireless business and came in ahead of our expectations. Upside in the quarter was driven by customers building a broad range of new devices in advance of the holiday season. 
Sequential growth in connectivity was driven by both improved mix and share gains in China. Amazon launched the Kindle Fire HD, which introduced 2 by 2 WiFi in-tablet to increase connection speeds up to 40%. The smartphones are also increasingly embracing dual-band WiFi to leverage the 5-gigahertz band for higher speed and improve signal reliability. 
In China, our combos are increasingly being found in cost-effective smartphones. This richer mix and broad geographic footprint highlights the value of a complete portfolio of connectivity products. 
We also saw strength in 5G WiFi, GPS and NFC. We're pleased with the ramp of 5G WiFi across multiple device categories. We have more than $100 million of orders for our mobile 5G WiFi solutions today, and production orders have just begun to ship. 
Our 3G baseband business also grew sequentially in Q3 driven by our highly integrated SoCs that address the growing global demand for affordable smartphones. T-Mobile introduced the Conquer smartphone, which is the first 3G smartphone based on the complete Broadcom platform selling in the North American market. Samsung also announced new Android Ice Cream Sandwich devices based on our latest single-core, 40-nanometer platform. When compared to our prior generation, this new solution includes enhanced multimedia acceleration and doubles the processor performance. We expect to see more products coming to market through the rest of the year, including powerful smartphones leveraging our 40-nanometer dual-core HSPA+ platform. 
Looking into Q4, we expect Mobile & Wireless revenue to be down slightly due to seasonality and some better-than-expected sell-in as a result of customer product launches during Q3. 
In summary, our product road map and design win traction are stronger than ever. We continue to bring best-in-class products to market while delivering fully integrated platforms to help customers get to market quickly. While we may see some variation in our business in the short term due to macroeconomic conditions, Broadcom is extremely well positioned for the future. Our relentless engineering focus, combined with our leadership position in the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor industry, continue to position us well for meaningful, long-term outperformance. 
This concludes our prepared comments, and we're now ready for your questions. Anthony, may we have the first question, please?"

The principal deviant from seasonal would be the Infrastructure group, which is consistent with what a number of companies have said both about data center and enterprise as well as service providers. So that's really why I think we are much closer to seasonal than other people are as our business continues to perform well and we pick up market share in broadband and in Mobile & Wireless."

So that accounts for some of the seasonality. We also have a little bit of our 2G business continuing to fall off. That's a little bit of a headwind. That's becoming fairly small, and that will essentially go to near 0 next year. So that'll diminish fairly quickly. On the positive side, we have things like 5G WiFi continued penetration and new 3G basebands coming out. So I'd say those are the puts and takes in the Wireless business in terms of driving the overall seasonal outlook."

In fact, I'd say it's probably the best integration of a public company I've ever seen. The employees are on board. We've had almost no attrition. They're performing extremely well. The primary reason we acquired NetLogic was for the processors, network processors, and we're doing very well there. You've seen we've announced a number of new products there, the 28-nanometer XLP 200 family, and we've got considerable design win traction there. Our revenue in processors has gone up every single quarter since we acquired the company. We're taking share. Looking at the design win traction there, we're taking share from a lot of the incumbents in that space. So I'm feeling pretty good about it."

And the way our incentive compensation works, as you know, is on relative performance. In the first quarter, we were outperforming our peers roughly on a weighted average by about 300 basis points. In Q2, that number was up close to 500 basis points. And in Q3, that number was close to 800 basis points. And the nature of the way you book these things is, if we really thought we were going to outperform in Q3 by that much, we would have booked it earlier in the year. And so because the acceleration from Q2 to Q3 was as significant as it was, it triggered that true-up of the incentive compensation such that through Q3 on a year-to-date basis, we're actually outperforming our peers by roughly 600 basis points. And that is pretty significant when you're talking about an industry that's growing somewhere around 0 or actually below 0 for many of our peers. So that does catch up in Q3. That does not roll into Q4. You're correct in the sense that it should not roll into Q4 because you're catching up Qs 1 and 2 into Q3. What's driving Q4 is actually a pretty significant step-up in design and development, which you can read into that as mask costs and engineering costs associated with masks as we move more and more product into dedicated 40-nanometer products for production and even 28-nanometer products on dedicated masks. In fact, in Q3, over 85% of the masks that we did were 40-nanometer and below, and 10% of the masks we did were 28-nanometer and below. So that's really what's driving the OpEx delta into Q4. I wish I could give you a better picture, but I can only get a sense of how we're going to do in the next quarter based on how our peers report and guide into next quarter, and it's a very incomplete picture when we close our books certainly. And then your second point on Emulex, we booked about $1.5 million to past damages and about $2 million on an ongoing basis to the royalty line."

And it's -- year-over-year, let's just use the number that you've got in the non-GAAP financials, it's about $90 million. If you take that $90 million, probably somewhere around $20 million of it is just wrap-around effect from the decisions we made in the prior year. So now you're down to about $70 million. And you take that $70 million. It's probably split equally or close to equally between the step-up associated with the acquisition of NetLogic into the P&L and an increase in our investments in LTE. Philosophically, in terms of how we're managing, we're trying to manage the company between 20% to 22% product operating income on a non-GAAP basis. This quarter, we were 21%. So we're trying to manage within that. Having said that, I think the biggest challenge for the industry is the relatively low growth in 2011 and 2012. And I've said before that I think that the inherent inflation in R&D without increasing headcount resources or tape-outs is probably in the vicinity of 3% to 5%. And so for us, we're growing slightly faster. We do have a pick-up because of some changes principally driven acquisition and an investment in LTE. But beyond that, we aren't making significant changes to the infrastructure of our R&D spend. And I suspect that, that won't change meaningfully into next year as well. And we'll try to manage that so that if we see a reasonable growth here, we'll actually see that leverage come back to the P&L and grow revenue faster than operating expenses."

It's interesting, we have processors across Broadcom in almost every one of our businesses: in our Broadband group, in our Networking group and in our Mobile group. And more and more, we've got the opportunity to get the processor experts together. It's kind of interesting because in the NetLogic acquisition, we have processors that are at the extreme end of anything that any of our competitors do, whereas in the mobile space, you're far more focused on power consumption and other things, and finding the right balance is important. And I think we've got the expertise in the company to do performance and power management, and that's the real key. One of the things you have to be careful of is, it's very easy to do a processor of any speed you want. The question is, what will be the power consumption when you do that? So it would be no problem at all for us to announce a processor that's faster than any of our competitors', but then the question is, what's the balance in terms of battery life and other things? And that's why looking at processor performance, you really need to look at performance per watt, okay, as the metric. And a lot of people aren't trained to look for that.

And I think that's going to cause a real change in the industry in that you're going to stay with some of the older nodes longer, and for products that are more focus on cost, you'll especially stay with those older nodes and try and get the best cost per transistor out of those rather than pushing the envelope on geometry. It used to be in the industry for decades that if you were to push the geometry, you would find better cost solutions, and that's no longer the case going forward.

But typical seasonality for Broadband going into Q1 is normally also down, sort of mid to high single digit. That's their normal seasonal pattern, at least over the last 5 years or so. If ING, as I mentioned, is in Q4 usually down a little bit, it's usually about flattish in Q1. Now I think that's really driven much more by the rate of adoption in some of the data center customers and the rate at which the providers start to dole out CapEx. And I think some of Verizon's commentaries probably have been fairly sobering to service provider space. And then as I mentioned in Mobile & Wireless, it's down about 5% typically in Q1. So again, standard deviations on these things are 8 to 10 points. So the standard deviation is much larger than the actual result, but that does give you a picture of what we normally see. In terms of inventory step-up, Q4 should be the end of any material number. We stepped down about $36 million in Q3. There's about $6 million, $7 million left. We'll probably wipe out most of that in Q4. And I think from a GAAP perspective, other than the amortization, which stays at the level it's been at relatively consistently, it will be pretty much where it is for -- from a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment unless there's another acquisition we do."

We're pleased to report quarterly revenue -- record revenue, record cash flow from operations and model profitability in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $2.13 billion, which was up 8% sequentially and at the high end of the guided range. Q3 was the first quarter in the company's history exceeding $2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 were up 10% over Q2, and cash flow from operations was a record $621 million. 
All 3 of our businesses grew in Q3. Mobile and Wireless grew almost 14% sequentially and crossed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. We continue to see strong demand for connectivity solutions, while our 3G baseband business continues to grow with the ramp of our latest 40-nanometer platform. 
Despite a challenging economic environment, we're benefiting from multiple attractive secular themes, including increasing WiFi attach rates, exponential growth in network traffic and strong adoption of high-definition cable and satellite solutions in emerging markets. 
This quarter, we introduced the industry's highest density, [indiscernible] Bragg switch and the industry's first 28-nanometer multicore communications processors. Broadcom's technology innovation has created a product portfolio that's stronger than ever and drives growth from new product cycles going forward.

As Chris mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the Investor section of our website for additional financial information that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize for Q3, total record revenue of $2.13 billion, including product revenue of $2.08 billion. Q3 total net revenue was up 8% sequentially and 8.7% year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin was 52.1%. Q3 GAAP product gross margin was 48.8%. Non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A expenses were up $28 million and $21 million, respectively, from Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 or $0.02 above First Call Consensus of $0.77 per share. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.38 per share, including $0.21 of acquisition-related and non-recurring adjustments outlined in our earnings release. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was a record $621 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. 
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In July, we said that we expected Q3 total net revenue to be $2 billion to $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue at the upper end of the range at $2.13 billion. The Broadband Communications segment was up a bit less than expected, increasing 2.6% from Q2 principally driven by growth in sales of set-top box platforms. Revenue from our Infrastructure & Networking segment was a bit stronger than anticipated, increasing 5.2% sequentially, driven principally by stronger-than-expected sales of switching products. Our Mobile and Wireless segment was up 13.7% from Q2 to a record $1.02 billion, which was slightly higher than anticipated driven primarily by strength in wireless connectivity.
The non-GAAP product gross margin was down 10 basis points from Q2 to 52.1%. This was consistent with our expectations of roughly flat. Our Q3 GAAP product gross margin was up 210 basis points from Q2 to 48.8%, consistent with our expectations, driven primarily by a decrease in inventory step-up of $36 million resulting from the sell-through of inventory assumed in our acquisition of NetLogic. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for Q3 were up $28 million from Q2 levels, which is above the high end of our guidance provided in July principally due to a true-up accrual for incentive compensation as a result of the company's improved relative performance versus our peers. On a GAAP basis, R&D and SG&A expenses were up $21 million from Q2 levels. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q3 at $3.2 billion. This reflects our quarterly record cash flow from operations of $621 million, the net proceeds of our debt offering of $492 million, our quarterly dividend payment of $56 million and a small amount of share repurchases in the quarter. For the quarter, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 37 days in Q3 and net inventory turns were 7.6. 
Finally, moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q4 to be roughly $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. Sequential revenue is expected to be roughly flat to Q3 for the Broadband segment, down for our Infrastructure & Networking segment and down slightly for our Mobile and Wireless segment. We expect Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP product gross margin to be flat to up slightly with GAAP gross margin improving slightly more due to the continued reduction in acquisition-related inventory step-up. In addition, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in Q4 to be flat to up $15 million. 
And now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business."

Starting with the Home Platform, our Broadband Communications revenue increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in our set-top box business. Solid secular trends and Broadcom innovations continue to fuel our set-top box business. In developed markets, we see increasing content for platform as customers ramp next-generation products with more tuners, more transcoding and additional networking technologies, including MoCA, powerline and WiFi. For example, our MoCA attach rate to cable set-top box platforms has more than quadrupled over the last year. 
In September, we strengthened our security and content protection offerings with the announcement of NAGRA OpenTV 5 support across cable, satellite and IP set-top boxes and gateways. When this is combined with integrated NAGRA On-chip Security, operators can securely deploy complementary, over-the-top services to more devices throughout the home. 
Outside of Europe and North America, we see share gains and continued growth in pay TV subscribers. For example, we recently announced the industry's first dual ISDB-T chipset for digital terrestrial TV in Latin America. This 40-nanometer solution enables our customers to reduce board space and lower costs to address the large and rapidly expanding digital terrestrial TV market in Latin America. 
Moving to our broadband access business, we've seen meaningful growth across DSL, PON and cable modem over the past year. Our DOCSIS 3.0 mix has grown by over 40% year-over-year and now represents more than 2/3 of our cable modem business. We also announced the integration of 5G WiFi on our DOCSIS 3.0 and VDSL gateway platforms, enabling our customers to accelerate their ramp of whole home coverage for subscribers. In DSL, we're driving vectoring technology for central office deployments, which doubles capacity by removing cross-talk interference. As announced by Belgacom and Alcatel-Lucent last week, we look for large-scale customer trials with VDSL2 vectoring technology by the end of this year. 
Looking into Q4, we expect our Broadband Communications revenue to be flat as strength in set-top box is being offset by the nearly concluded rollout of our legacy Blu-ray and DTV businesses.
Moving to infrastructure. Our Infrastructure & Networking revenue was up 5% sequentially in Q3 driven by growth in Ethernet switch, PHY and multicore processors. During the quarter, we extended our leadership in Ethernet switching for the data center with the introduction of Trident II, which is the world's highest-density switch chip. With 4.8 billion transistors on a single chip, Trident II delivers more than 110-gigabit Ethernet ports or up to 32 40-gigabit ports and is optimized for software-defined networks and cloud-scale data centers, supporting tens of thousands of servers and virtual machines. Trident II is sampling now and will be adopted in data center networks in 2013.
We also expanded our product portfolio with the introduction of the world's first 28-nanometer communications processor family. The XLP 200-Series delivers best-in-class core performance enabled by quad issue, quad threading and 2-gigahertz out-of-order execution with security acceleration technologies. By moving to 28-nanometer, the XLP 200-Series delivers up to 400% greater performance while, at the same time, consuming up to 60% less power. The XLP 200-Series is sampling now and expected to ramp next year.
Finally, our announcement with Hyundai is the most recent example of a major automotive manufacturer engaging with Broadcom to deploy Ethernet in advanced driver assist systems, telematics and infotainment. Building on our relationship with industry leaders like BMW, our BroadR-Reach technology has been standardized and promoted by the OPEN Alliance, which has grown to more than 80 members over the last year. While we're still in the early stages of this opportunity, automotive is expanding the addressable market for Ethernet. 
We expect our Infrastructure revenue to be down sequentially in Q4 driven by softness in data center and enterprise spending as well as continued softness in service provider capital expenditures. 
Moving to our Hand Platform, our Mobile and Wireless revenue grew by almost 14% sequentially to a record $1.02 billion driven by solid growth in wireless connectivity. Our connectivity business grew faster than our overall Mobile and Wireless business and came in ahead of our expectations. Upside in the quarter was driven by customers building a broad range of new devices in advance of the holiday season. 
Sequential growth in connectivity was driven by both improved mix and share gains in China. Amazon launched the Kindle Fire HD, which introduced 2x2 WiFi in tablets to increase connection speeds up to 40%. New smartphones are also increasingly embracing dual-band WiFi to leverage the 5-gigahertz band for higher speed and improve signal reliability. 
In China, our combos are increasingly being found in cost-effective smartphones. This richer mix and broad geographic footprint highlights the value of a complete portfolio of connectivity products. 
We also saw strength in 5G WiFi, GPS and NFC. We're pleased with the ramp of 5G WiFi across multiple device categories. We have more than $100 million of orders for our mobile 5G WiFi solutions today, and production orders have just begun to ship. 
Our 3G baseband business also grew sequentially in Q3 driven by our highly integrated SoCs that address the growing global demand for affordable smartphones. T-Mobile introduced the Conquer smartphone, which is the first 3G smartphone based on the complete Broadcom platform selling in the North American market. Samsung also announced new Android Ice Cream Sandwich devices based on our latest single-core, 40-nanometer platform. When compared to our prior generation, this new solution includes enhanced multimedia acceleration and doubles the processor performance. We expect to see more products coming to market through the rest of the year, including powerful smartphones leveraging our 40-nanometer dual-core HSPA+ platform. 
Looking into Q4, we expect Mobile and Wireless revenue to be down slightly due to seasonality and some better-than-expected sell-in as a result of customer product launches during Q3. 
In summary, our product roadmap and design win traction are stronger than ever. We continue to bring best-in-class products to market while delivering fully integrated platforms to help customers get to market quickly. While we may see some variation in our business in the short term due to macroeconomic conditions, Broadcom is extremely well positioned for the future. Our relentless engineering focus, combined with our leadership position in the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor industry, continue to position us well for meaningful, long-term outperformance.

And if you think about our connectivity business, a lot of that goes through modules. And so our total cycle time is longer than a lot of our competitors'. So it'll typically be shipped by us in Q3, assembled into modules and delivered to customers late Q3 and into Q4. So that tends to shift our peak a little more into Q3 than you would see from others. So that accounts for some of the seasonality. We also have a little bit of our 2G business continuing to fall off. That's a little bit of a headwind. That's becoming fairly small, and that will essentially go to near 0 next year. So that'll diminish fairly quickly. On the positive side, we have things like 5G WiFi continued penetration and new 3G basebands coming out. So I'd say those are the puts and takes in the Wireless business in terms of driving the overall seasonal outlook."

And the way our incentive compensation works, as you know, is on relative performance. In the first quarter, we were outperforming our peers roughly on a weighted average by about 300 basis points. In Q2, that number was up close to 500 basis points. And in Q3, that number is close to 800 basis points. And the nature of the way you book these things is if we really thought we were going to outperform in Q3 by that much, we would have booked it earlier in the year. And so because the acceleration from Q2 to Q3 was as significant as it was, it triggered that true-up of the incentive compensation such that through Q3 on a year-to-date basis, we're actually outperforming our peers by roughly 600 basis points. And that is pretty significant when you're talking about an industry that's growing somewhere around 0 or actually below 0 for many of our peers. So that does catch up in Q3. That does not roll into Q4. You're correct in the sense that it should not roll into Q4 because you're catching up Qs 1 and 2 into Q3. What's driving Q4 is actually a pretty significant step-up in design and development, which you can read into that as mask [ph] costs and engineering costs associated with masks [ph] as we move more and more product into dedicated 40-nanometer products for production and even 28-nanometer products on dedicated masks [ph]. In fact, in Q3, over 85% of the masks [ph] that we did were 40-nanometer and below, and 10% of the masks [ph] we did were 28-nanometer and below. So that's really what's driving the OpEx delta into Q4. I wish I could give you a better picture, but I can only get a sense of how we're going to do in the next quarter based on how our peers report and guide into next quarter, and it's a very incomplete picture when we close our books certainly. And then your second point on Emulex, we booked about $1.5 million to past damages and about $2 million on an ongoing basis to the royalty line."

And year-over-year, let's just use the number that you've got in the non-GAAP financials, it's about $90 million. If you take that $90 million, probably somewhere around $20 million of it is just wrap-around effect from the decisions we made in the prior year. So now you're down to about $70 million. And if you take that $70 million, it's probably split equally or close to equally between the step-up associated with the acquisition of NetLogic into the P&L and an increase in our investments in LTE. Philosophically, in terms of how we're managing, we're trying to manage the company between 20% to 22% product operating income on a non-GAAP basis. This quarter, we were 21%. So we're trying to manage within that. Having said that, I think the biggest challenge for the industry is the relatively low growth in 2011 and 2012. And I've said before that I think that the inherent inflation in R&D without increasing headcount resources or tape-outs is probably in the vicinity of 3% to 5%. And so for us, we're growing slightly faster. We do have a pick-up because of some changes principally driven acquisition and an investment in LTE. But beyond that, we aren't making significant changes to the infrastructure of our R&D spend. And I suspect that, that won't change meaningfully into next year as well. And we'll try to manage that so that, hopefully, if we see a reasonable growth here, we'll actually see that leverage come back to the P&L and grow revenue faster than operating expenses."

But I feel good about the fast single-core and the faster dual-core products that are coming out, and I believe that trajectory will continue. It's interesting; we have processors across Broadcom in almost every one of our businesses: in our Broadband group, in our Networking group and in our Mobile group. And more and more, we've got the opportunity to get the processor experts together. It's kind of interesting because in the NetLogic acquisition, we have processors that are at the extreme end of anything that any of our competitors do, whereas in the mobile space, you're far more focused on power consumption and other things, and finding the right balance is important. And I think we've got the expertise in the company to do performance and power management, and that's the real key. One of the things you have to be careful of is it's very easy to do a processor of any speed you want. The question is what will be the power consumption when you do that? So it would be no problem at all for us to announce a processor that's faster than any of our competitors', but then the question is, what's the balance in terms of battery life and other things? And that's why looking at processor performance, you really need to look at performance per watt, okay, as the metric. And a lot of people aren't trained to look for that.

So I don't think 20 nanometer is going to give you any cost breaks. It may allow you to design a faster chip, but the cost per transistor will start going up us you start going into these nodes. And I think that's going to cause a real change in the industry in that you're going to stay with some of the older nodes longer, and for products that are more focus on cost, you'll especially stay with those older nodes and try and get the best cost per transistor out of those rather than pushing the envelope on geometry. It used to be in the industry for decades that if you were to push the geometry, you would find better cost solutions, and that's no longer the case going forward. So we'll start to see sort of a bottoming out of that and eventually an increase as you go into smaller geometries and the cost per transistor."

We need both the right technologies and the capability to support them locally in language, on-site. And so Broadcom, when we look at where we've done a lot of our hiring recently, we've ramped up our Chinese team. We have created a team that's capable of doing reference designs. That's a very common way of doing business in China where they want you to do pretty much a turnkey handset. And we now have a team in place capable of doing that, and they are producing turnkey designs. And I think that's going to be just as important, to your point, as having the right technologies there supporting local customers with a local support team with reference designs."

But typical seasonality for Broadband going into Q1 is normally also down, sort of mid to high single digits. That's their normal seasonal pattern, at least over the last 5 years or so. If ING, as I mentioned, is in Q4 usually down a little bit, it's usually about flattish in Q1. Now I think that's really driven much more by the rate of adoption in some of the data center customers and the rate at which the providers start to dole out CapEx. And I think some of Verizon's commentaries probably have been fairly sobering to the service provider space. And then as I mentioned in Mobile and Wireless, it's down about 5% typically in Q1. So again, standard deviations on these things are 8 to 10 points. So the standard deviation is much larger than the actual result, but that does give you a picture of what we normally see. In terms of inventory step-up, Q4 should be the end of any material number. We stepped down about $36 million in Q3. There's about $6 million, $7 million left. We'll probably wipe out most of that in Q4. And I think from a GAAP perspective, other than the amortization, which stays at the level it's been at relatively consistently, it will be pretty much where it is for -- from a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment unless there's another acquisition we do."
