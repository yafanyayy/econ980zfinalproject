Our earnings press release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The forward-looking statements and information and risk factors section discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn’t providing reported earnings guidance.

Let me welcome everyone for joining us today in our call. Since I will see many of you next week, excuse me, I’ll keep my comments brief and be available for questions after Tom covers the results. 2011 was another year of strong financial performance. Our adjusted EPS was a $1.45 slightly exceeding the guidance set back in February and up nearly 7% from the $1.36 in adjusted EPS reported in 2010.
This was the ninth consecutive year we achieved or exceeded our original EPS target. Gross operating cash flow continues to grow primarily driven by our investments in the utility. In 2011, this cash flow was $1.6 billion. It is expected to continue to grow at about $100 million a year over the next five years. Our shareholders experienced an attractive 24% TSR last year and nearly a 150% TSR over the past three years.
It appears the market has recognized our consistent financial performance and significant dividend increases over this period. Although we have made good progress increasing our PE multiples, we still have more work to do to fully eliminate the peer discount. Few weeks ago, we raised the dividend 14% to a payout level of 62% which is in line with our peers.
This is a sign of the Board’s confidence with our progress and with our long-term business outlook. Overall, I am very pleased with the results in 2011 and look forward to building on our success in 2012. One of our top priorities in 2012 is to focus on our customers’ needs as fundamental as this may seen, we can do a better job. Last year, we launched the customer value initiative which focuses on moving up the value chain. We will talk more about this important initiative next week at our Investor Meeting.
We also want to firmly align with you, our shareholders. We will continue to be transparent with our business model, clearly identifying the financial and operational metrics most important to you and delivering the results. We are fortunate to have a good energy law in Michigan that provides the foundation for investment decisions and lays the groundwork for regulatory decisions. However I believe there is room for improvement, for improvement in the process that will be in the best interest of all parties.
I believe the few process changes could make Michigan’s regulatory model one of the best in the country. Risk is one of the key elements of any investment or business decision. We focus on identifying financial and business risk and evaluating the alternatives along with the cost of mitigation. I have confidence that we have mitigated as much risk as possible or have backup plans in place for the various risks we may encounter.
We are establishing our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance at a $1.52 to $1.55 per share in a tight range of 5% to 7%. This should support continued TSR performance in the 9% to 11% range. Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom to share more insights about 2011 and 2012.

Let me welcome to everybody on the call today. Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace.

Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace. That evolved in the 6% to 8% a year. We met that goal and we met it at the high end of the range. We dipped once in 2007 to reflect the planned sale of international assets before the full-year benefits kicked in. The full-year benefit of lower debt and interest expense and higher utility equity and earnings occurred in 2008 as planned.
This major sale made possible our consistently strong earnings performance. In 2010, we moved to increase certainty of our investor return. We shifted a bit towards dividend yield by increasing our dividend 40% from a yield of about 3% to one at 4%. We also aligned our EPS growth outlook at 5% to 7% and started from the high performance accomplished in 2010.
And as John just highlighted for you, we exceeded our EPS target last year continuing to perform at the high end of our projected range. Our dividend increase last month was the sixth in a row at $0.96 a share, it represents a 62% payout, and that’s about the average of our peers. This combined with strong EPS growth should provide a healthy TSR and the good platform for continued growth. Equally reflective of our past performance and outlook is our continued operating cash flow growth. That’s averaging about a $100 million each year.
This investment driven growth provides the capacity to enhance the dividend and the capacity to reduce parent debt when our investment needs ease. As you can see here, our 2011 earnings growth compared with 2010 was driven by our core business, the utility. The impact with soft energy prices on our ITPs was largely offset by refinancing in the attractive financial markets.
And this performance isn’t easily accomplished. Our team works hard every day to deliver it and here is a sampling of the absent flows during 2011. As you can see in the green bulge on the left top of the slide the cold winter a year ago provided financial capacity to accelerate reliability spending, specifically including more tree trimming than we originally have planned.
As you can see in the red dip, around the spring time we had to pull back a little when record storms occurred including ice storms doubled level of previous years. The hot summer along with good tax and better than planned operating performance provided space for more customer reliability investment. We pushed hard last year and in prior years to balance our work in a manner that accelerates customer performance improvements and delivers consistent earnings growth.
It’s not easy that the model works well for our customers and you, our investors. So here is our final report card for 2011 always but there is no rest, we’ve been working on 2012 plans for more than a year. We are providing 2012 earnings guidance in a narrow range for the first time in many years at 5% to 7% resulting in earnings at a $1.52 to $1.55 a share. As usual, we’re building this off our results last year where we were already at the high end of our long-term growth range.
So here is a look at the work ahead. We’ve already faced mild winter weather in January and February, and recall we do not have decoupling for weather in the gas business. Although adverse weather has cost us about a $0.05 a share so far this year, we are able to offset it. We’re taking action to address additional mild weather if it’s necessary and this is fully consistent with our strategic model.
So how does it work in 2012? It’s the same investment driven model we’ve used for several years. The same model that drives us for the next five years. Our customer driven investment continues at a pace that grows rate base, EPS, and operating cash flow at about 5% to 7%. But why not invest less? Because there are investments - these are investments that are needed to meet laws, regulations and responsible service levels for our customers. Then why not invest more? We work hard to prioritize the capital spending in a manner to keep our base rate increases at or below inflation, otherwise we don’t think we’re serving our customers in a responsible manner and one that would be sustainable for you.
Importantly many people across Michigan worked hard to establish the new State Energy Law in 2008. And we’re fortunate to have fair regulation that supports that law. For 2012, our electric and gas rate cases are primarily about new capital investment. The investment represents 95% of the gas and 97% of the electric self-implementation levels. The gas case maybe at a size that settled but we’ll learn more about that later today.
Staff positions on both cases reflect ROEs that are below the national average. They also include sales on uncollectible account levels below existing experience. As in our last three rounds of rate cases, the commission may choose to strike the balance that provides resources to continue needed investment and reflect existing conditions. We’re fortunate that they have seen these needs and our commitment to serve customers. We’re working diligently to keep our cost and customer rates low, but while incremental power prices are extraordinarily low, well below replacement costs, some customers seek to temporarily leave bundled service.
Some of those not within the 10% cap established in the 2008 Energy Law have pressed for a higher cap. Key legislative and administrative leaders have reviewed the situation and chosen so far not to make any change during the period of artificially low prices. When prices return to a level that reflects replacement costs, our base load generation costs will provide clear advantages to all our bundled customers.
Our model includes strong customer focus and we’re pushing hard, in fact very hard to enhance service and minimize prices. We continue to deliver base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. To support this, we reduced O&M in our last two rate cases. We expect to keep our base rate case increases below 2% through the next five years. Our approach is to bring smaller, routine rate cases annually in order to simplify the process, avoid rate shocks and permit timely recovery of investment, the primary focus of each request.
In the gas business, we expect that reductions in our DCR will result in savings to customers that more than offset increases over the next three years. We don’t expect to be as fortunate in the electric utility, but we are continuing to work to slow the growth of fuel and PSCR cost. An important part of the plan to hold down rates includes reducing our O&M cost in a manner that enhances service while eliminating waste. In the last two years, we’ve reduced our headcount by 4% and this is a big contributor to our plan that not only offsets inflation but reduces total O&M cost by 4%.
Over the next five years, we expect to lower O&M costs by a further 1% each year more than offsetting inflation costs and productivity. We’re into the third year of economic recovery in Michigan which is shown here, weather adjusted electric sales up 2% in 2012. This helps all customers by spreading the impact of needed investment more broadly. During 2011, Michigan added 80,000 private sector jobs. Over the last two years, unemployment dropped five points from 14.1% to 9.3%.
While U.S. unemployment dropped a point, Michigan ranked number one among all states in manufacturing growth up 13% and number two in construction growth up 3%. U.S. auto production is up 17% so far this year compared to last year. Used car prices are high and that’s another signal of improving new car sales ahead.
Clearly the revisions to business taxes, the auto recovery and the constructive approach to economic development are working. For example, in the most recent State Business Tax Climate Index update that came from a nonpartisan tax research group, Michigan advanced from 49 to number seven among all 50 states. Pretty good track record. Although last on our list today, an important and unusual to most utilities element of our model includes the use of NOLs to provide - to avoid the need for equity, not just for this year, not just for next year, but for the next five years.
We planned routine drift in another small equity programs but no new block equity offerings over the next five years. Now clearly it’s an appropriate business case presented itself, we wouldn’t have to take to bring it to you but we are able self fund planned investments of about $6.5 billion over the next five years. Cash flow is healthy with 2012 utility operating cash flow at $1.6 billion, up another $125 million. Recall that we accelerated both parent debt funding and companywide pension contributions in 2011, eliminating the need for more pension funding this year or next year.
We lowered our discount rates at the end of the year to 4.9%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year. We also lowered our expected return from 8% to 7.75%. The adverse earnings impact of about three pennies a share was more than offset by the effect of our cash contributions to the pension fund. So as we do with parent debt, pre-funding the pension plan provides another strong measure of risk mitigation.
Here is our routine profit and cash flow sensitivity chart, updated to address 2012. You can use this to easily reach your own estimate of our outlook. Now please note that we expect electric decoupling for energy efficiency to continue but we anticipate decoupling for economic and weather changes to end. We’ve highlighted that here in our sensitivities. Although we prefer to continue decoupling for economic increases or decreases, this probably provides an upside during the recovery.
Please don’t forget we’ll seek to reinvest any gains should they occur in more reliability. Also please note the ROE sensitivity. We anticipate a reduction from existing authorized levels and you can see some possible impacts here. So here is a recap of our targets for 2012 with important improvements over 2011. And don’t forget the Investor Meeting that’s schedule for the New York Stock Exchange on February 29. You’ll have a chance to hear from our executive team and join us in celebrating our 65th anniversary, or 65th year of listing on the New York Stock Exchange as well as our 125th year of proudly serving the people and the businesses of the State of Michigan.
So John and I would be delighted now to take your questions operator, if you’d open the call.

There is a difference in ROE which I know Dan credits us [ph] for evading that a little bit but there is a difference there and I have a funny feeling, there will be some good analysts to configure out our number from these.
And on uncollectible, it’s simply recognizing a three year history rather than the present experience. So we’re hopeful on that particular one that folks will acknowledge where we are today. And maybe do something creative whether it’s a tracker or whatever it maybe as a way of ensuring that we don’t over recover on new ways because that’s not our intent. We just want to recover whatever the experience is. On investment, there is some very small pipeline things that are in discussion right now.
Generally it’s hard to find an example where we’ve ever been trend down on investments. So as long as there is confidence we’re doing the right thing, I think we’ll get proper recovery on the investments. So there is not really deep terrible issue there. And on revenue it’s a little bit - this isn’t really the mainstream revenue, this is sort of the buy-sells that we do that kind of thing in the gas business. And this is again staff taking a looking at a three year history rather our most recent experience. And if you look at what’s actually happening today, I think that we can find common ground on that one as well.
And O&M is sort of a little bag of a variety of different things. So the impression that you might get there is that we may not be as far apart as it appears and when you think of the size of where we are, it’s probably something that could move toward settlement, those things take a little bit time though. And we’ll see that will up to the staff and the commission and all the other parties too.

We work hard to bring the O&M cost down because we don’t benefit from that except in the short-term that’s a way of creating headroom and helping our customers and offset the recovery we get from the capital investments that we are putting in place for them.
This year, we’re able to take our O&M costs down by about 4%. That maybe one of the best that we’ve done when I look through modern history our track record has always been up more closer to inflation levels. But we are blowing the inflation away and we’re going to zero and we’re not stopping we’re going down. We told you here that we are looking for the forward years to be flat to 1% down, but as we get closer to each year that’s when we work harder to do the things that provide the productivity that make a lot of sense.
And I’ll give you one example. Hardening the system is something that we’ve been doing for sometime. We put investment in place to put better poles, better wires, better pipes in place and by doing that, when storms and problems like that that are O&M related occur, we don’t have as much problem. We don’t have as much damage. And I think that a team that’s focused on improving all the time finds and surprises itself with how much it can do. So if there are limits, of course there is a point where we can’t go much further and therefore do actions that jeopardize the service that our customers would get.
Do we put a number on a cap on it? No. And so we’ll - I can’t tell you this, this will give you a little help. We didn’t anticipate $0.05 a bad news in the weather in January and February where we don’t have any decoupling on the weather side for the gas business. So that wasn’t easy but we’ve gone off and we’ve already have all the plans in place to fully accommodate that. We expect that the weather is pretty mild. You don’t have the benefit of this but I am looking out the window here in Jackson, Michigan. I wouldn’t say put your bathing suit on but it’s a little more pleasant than what we might normally see this time of year. So we’re putting some work together to figure out what we can do.

This isn’t to say that somebody may not introduce the bill to increase the cap or do something different but I think the Governor’s interest is more in infrastructure investments, finding a way to make investments in infrastructure which creates jobs and benefits the state in a long-term basis.
It also would help the infrastructure that I think he is worried about which is the road infrastructure. I think as you know as we go and do replace pipes and mains and services, it does cause havoc in the roads but after it’s completed the roads are replaced. So it may be a nice combination in the future to be able to replace the infrastructure where you have gas mains at the same time have the infrastructure of the roads replaced at the same time.

We have a goal inside the company to try to keep that debt flat or bring it down. I would like to two points about it. One is that with all the bonus depreciation that we’ve been getting each of the last few years including a 100% last year. It’s been wonderful but it all happens in the utility and creates a bubble at the parent debt because we aren’t able to use our NOLs to shelter taxes because they are already sheltered down at the utility.
So for that reason you see a little bubble up, we don’t like it, but we know it’s very temporary and we’re still on our trajectory to bring that down as we go through time. So that’s our plan. But the second point is the reason we’re not bringing it down at an even faster clip is simply because when we invest in the utility, we get that 10% to 11% after-tax return. And when we take out the parent debt, we only get a 4% to 5% after-tax return. So the comparison on the economics is real simple.
But we’ll talk to you more. Hope you’ll be with us too. We’ll talk to you more in New York to remind you about the things we do to ensure that we are well protected like thick liquidity and pre-funding and all that so the parent debt won’t be an issue. And as we keep growing the utility, the cash flow grows through time and it gets to a very high level which was the point in the slide. So that when your spending comes off a little bit, you can put that to use in more dividend or you can put it in use to parent debt reduction, there will be a lot of wonderful choices that we’re creating for ourselves. But it’s a few years away.

With me are John Russell, President and CEO; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings press release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The forward-looking statements and information and risk factors section discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn't providing reported earnings guidance. Now, I'll turn the call over to John."

Let me welcome to everybody on the call today. Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace.

Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace. That evolved into 6% to 8% a year. We met that goal and we met it at the high end of the range. We dipped once in 2007 to reflect the planned sale of international assets before the full-year benefits kicked in. The full-year benefit of lower debt and interest expense and higher utility equity and earnings occurred in 2008 as planned. This major sale made possible our consistently strong earnings performance. In 2010, we moved to increase certainty of our investor return. We shifted a bit towards dividend yield by increasing our dividend 40% from a yield of about 3% to one at 4%. We also aligned our EPS growth outlook at 5% to 7% and started from the high performance accomplished in 2010. And as John just highlighted for you, we exceeded our EPS target last year continuing to perform at the high end of our projected range. Our dividend increase last month was the sixth in a row at $0.96 a share, it represents a 62% payout, and that's about the average of our peers. This combined with strong EPS growth should provide a healthy TSR and the good platform for continued growth. Equally reflective of our past performance and outlook is our continued operating cash flow growth. That's averaging about $100 million each year. This investment driven growth provides the capacity to enhance the dividend and the capacity to reduce parent debt when our investment needs ease. 
As you can see here, our 2011 earnings growth compared with 2010 was driven by our core business, the utility. The impact of soft energy prices on our ITPs was largely offset by refinancing in the attractive financial markets. And this performance isn't easily accomplished. Our team works hard every day to deliver it and here is a sampling of the ebbs and flows during 2011. As you can see in the green bulge on the left top of the slide, the cold winter a year ago provided financial capacity to accelerate reliability spending, specifically including more tree trimming than we originally have planned. As you can see in the red dip, around the spring time we had to pull back a little when record storms occurred, including ice storms double the level of previous years. The hot summer along with good tax and better than planned operating performance provided space for more customer reliability investment. We pushed hard last year and in prior years to balance our work in a manner that accelerates customer performance improvements and delivers consistent earnings growth. It's not easy but the model works well for our customers and you, our investors. 
So here is our final report card for 2011, all A's. But there is no rest, we've been working on 2012 plans for more than a year. We are providing 2012 earnings guidance in a narrow range for the first time in many years at 5% to 7% resulting in earnings at $1.52 to $1.55 a share. As usual, we're building this off our results last year where we were already at the high end of our long-term growth range. So here is a look at the work ahead. We've already faced mild winter weather in January and February, and recall we do not have decoupling for weather in the gas business. Although adverse weather has cost us about a $0.05 a share so far this year, we are able to offset it. We're taking action to address additional mild weather if it's necessary and this is fully consistent with our strategic model. 
So how does it work in 2012? It's the same investment driven model we've used for several years. The same model that drives us for the next 5 years. Our customer driven investment continues at a pace that grows rate base, EPS, and operating cash flow at about 5% to 7%. But why not invest less? Because there are investments - these are investments that are needed to meet laws, regulations and responsible service levels for our customers. Then why not invest more? We work hard to prioritize the capital spending in a manner to keep our base rate increases at or below inflation, otherwise we don't think we're serving our customers in a responsible manner and one that would be sustainable for you. Importantly many people across Michigan worked hard to establish the new State Energy Law in 2008. And we're fortunate to have fair regulation that supports that law. For 2012, our electric and gas rate cases are primarily about new capital investment. The investment represents 95% of the gas and 97% of the electric self-implementation levels. The gas case may be at a size that settled but we'll learn more about that later today. Staff positions on both cases reflect ROEs that are below the national average. They also include sales on uncollectible account levels below existing experience. As in our last 3 rounds of rate cases, the commission may choose to strike a balance that provides resources to continue needed investment and reflect existing conditions. We're fortunate that they have seen these needs and our commitment to serve customers. We're working diligently to keep our cost and customer rates low, but while incremental power prices are extraordinarily low, well below replacement costs, some customers seek to temporarily leave bundled service. Some of those not within the 10% cap established in the 2008 Energy Law have pressed for a higher cap. Key legislative and administrative leaders have reviewed the situation and chosen so far not to make any change during the period of artificially low prices. When prices return to a level that reflects replacement costs, our base load generation costs will provide clear advantages to all our bundled customers. 
Our model includes strong customer focus and we're pushing hard, in fact very hard to enhance service and minimize prices. We continue to deliver base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. To support this, we reduced O&M in our last 2 rate cases. We expect to keep our base rate case increases below 2% through the next 5 years. Our approach is to bring smaller, routine rate cases annually in order to simplify the process, avoid rate shocks and permit timely recovery of investment, the primary focus of each request. In the gas business, we expect that reductions in our GCR will result in savings to customers that more than offset increases over the next 3 years. We don't expect to be as fortunate in the electric utility, but we are continuing to work to slow the growth of fuel and PSCR costs. An important part of the plan to hold down rates includes reducing our O&M cost in a manner that enhances service while eliminating waste. In the last 2 years, we've reduced our headcount by 4% and this is a big contributor to our plan that not only offsets inflation but reduces total O&M cost by 4%. Over the next 5 years, we expect to lower O&M costs by a further 1% each year more than offsetting inflation costs and productivity. We're in the third year of economic recovery in Michigan which is shown here, weather adjusted electric sales up 2% in 2012. This helps all customers by spreading the impact of needed investment more broadly. During 2011, Michigan added 80,000 private sector jobs. Over the last 2 years, unemployment dropped 5 points from 14.1% to 9.3%. While U.S. unemployment dropped a point, Michigan ranked number one among all states in manufacturing growth up 13% and number 2 in construction growth up 3%. U.S. auto production is up 17% so far this year compared to last year. Used car prices are high and that's another signal of improving new car sales ahead. Clearly the revisions to business taxes, the auto recovery and the constructive approach to economic development are working. For example, in the most recent State Business Tax Climate Index update that came from a nonpartisan tax research group, Michigan advanced from 49 to number 7 among all 50 states. Pretty good track record. 
Although last on our list today, an important and unusual to most utilities element of our model includes the use of NOLs to provide - to avoid the need for equity, not just for this year, not just for next year, but for the next 5 years. We plan routine drift [ph] in another small equity programs but no new block equity offerings over the next 5 years. Now clearly it's an appropriate business case presented itself, we wouldn't hesitate to bring it to you but we are able to self fund planned investments of about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years. Cash flow is healthy with 2012 utility operating cash flow at $1.6 billion, up another $125 million. Recall that we accelerated both parent debt funding and companywide pension contributions in 2011, eliminating the need for more pension funding this year or next year. We lowered our discount rates at the end of the year to 4.9%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year. We also lowered our expected return from 8% to 7.75%. The adverse earnings impact of about $0.03 a share was more than offset by the effect of our cash contributions to the pension fund. So as we do with parent debt, pre-funding the pension plan provides another strong measure of risk mitigation. 
Here is our routine profit and cash flow sensitivity chart, updated to address 2012. You can use this to easily reach your own estimate of our outlook. Now please note that we expect electric decoupling for energy efficiency to continue but we anticipate decoupling for economic and weather changes to end. We've highlighted that here in our sensitivities. Although we prefer to continue decoupling for economic increases or decreases, this probably provides an upside during the recovery. Please don't forget we'll seek to reinvest any gains should they occur in more reliability. Also please note the ROE sensitivity. We anticipate a reduction from existing authorized levels and you can see some possible impacts here. So here is a recap of our targets for 2012 with important improvements over 2011. And don't forget the Investor Meeting that's scheduled for the New York Stock Exchange on February 29. You'll have a chance to hear from our executive team and join us in celebrating our 65th anniversary, or 65th year of listing on the New York Stock Exchange as well as our 125th year of proudly serving the people and the businesses of the State of Michigan. So John and I would be delighted now to take your questions operator, if you'd open the call."

And I think the focus ought to be, look at the big items. There is a difference in ROE which I know Dan credits us for evading that a little bit but there is a difference there and I have a funny feeling, there will be some good analysts to configure out our number from these. And on uncollectibles, it's simply recognizing a 3 year history rather than the present experience. So we're hopeful on that particular one that folks will acknowledge where we are today. And maybe do something creative, whether it's a tracker or whatever it maybe as a way of ensuring that we don't over recover on UAs [ph] because that's not our intent. We just want to recover whatever the experience is. On investment, there is some very small pipeline things that are in discussion right now. Generally it's hard to find an example where we've ever been turned down on investments. So as long as there is confidence we're doing the right thing, I think we'll get proper recovery on the investments. So there is not really a big terrible issue there. And on revenue it's a little bit - this isn't really the mainstream revenue, this is sort of the buy-sells that we do that kind of thing in the gas business. And this is again staff taking a looking at a 3 year history rather our most recent experience. And if you look at what's actually happening today, I think that we can find common ground on that one as well. And O&M is sort of a little bag of a variety of different things. So the impression that you might get there is that we may not be as far apart as it appears and when you think of the size of where we are, it's probably something that could move toward settlement, those things take a little bit of time though. And we'll see, that will up to the staff and the commission and all the other parties too."

And I'll give you an example that kind of relates to that. We work hard to bring the O&M cost down because we don't benefit from that except in the short-term that's a way of creating headroom and helping our customers and offset the recovery we get from the capital investments that we are putting in place for them. This year, we're able to take our O&M costs down by about 4%. That maybe one of the best that we've done when I look through modern history our track record has always been up more closer to inflation levels. But we are blowing the inflation away and we're going to 0 and we're not stopping, we're going down. We told you here that we are looking for the forward years to be flat to 1% down, but as we get closer to each year that's when we work harder to do the things that provide the productivity that make a lot of sense. And I'll give you one example. Hardening the system is something that we've been doing for sometime. We put investment in place to put better poles, better wires, better pipes in place and by doing that, when storms and problems like that that are O&M related occur, we don't have as much problem. We don't have as much damage. And I think that a team that's focused on improving all the time finds and surprises itself with how much it can do. So if there are limits, of course there is a point where we can't go much further and therefore do actions that jeopardize the service that our customers would get. Do we put a number on a cap on it? No. And so we'll - I can tell you this, this will give you a little help. We didn't anticipate $0.05 a bad news in the weather in January and February where we don't have any decoupling on the weather side for the gas business. So that wasn't easy but we've gone off and we've already have all the plans in place to fully accommodate that. We expect that the weather is pretty mild. You don't have the benefit of this but I am looking out the window here in Jackson, Michigan. I wouldn't say put your bathing suit on but it's a little more pleasant than what we might normally see this time of year. So we're putting some work together to figure out what we can do."

But keep in mind we're deep into those spending plans, particularly on the EPA works. So you see this year at $1.4 billion but that's not new news from what we have been telling you in the past. We're well into that spending program."

We have a goal inside the company to try to keep that debt flat or bring it down. I would like to 2 points about it. One is that with all the bonus depreciation that we've been getting each of the last few years including 100% last year. It's been wonderful but it all happens in the utility and creates a bubble at the parent debt because we aren't able to use our NOLs to shelter taxes because they are already sheltered down at the utility. So for that reason you see a little bubble up, we don't like it, but we know it's very temporary and we're still on our trajectory to bring that down as we go through time. So that's our plan. But the second point is the reason we're not bringing it down at an even faster clip is simply because when we invest in the utility, we get that 10% to 11% after-tax return. And when we take out the parent debt, we only get a 4% to 5% after-tax return. So the comparison on the economics is real simple. But we'll talk to you more. Hope you'll be with us too. We'll talk to you more in New York to remind you about the things we do to ensure that we are well protected like thick liquidity and pre-funding and all that so the parent debt won't be an issue. And as we keep growing the utility, the cash flow grows through time and it gets to a very high level which was the point in the slide. So that when your spending comes off a little bit, you can put that to use in more dividend or you can put it in use to parent debt reduction, there will be a lot of wonderful choices that we're creating for ourselves. But it's a few years away."

Let me welcome everyone for joining us today in our call. Since I will see many of you next week, excuse me, I'll keep my comments brief and be available for questions after Tom covers the results. 2011 was another year of strong financial performance. Our adjusted EPS was a $1.45 slightly exceeding the guidance set back in February and up nearly 7% from the $1.36 adjusted EPS reported in 2010. This was the ninth consecutive year we achieved or exceeded our original EPS target. Gross operating cash flow continues to grow, primarily driven by our investments in the utility. 
In 2011, this cash flow was $1.6 billion. It is expected to continue to grow at about $100 million a year over the next 5 years. Our shareholders experienced an attractive 24% TSR last year and nearly 150% TSR over the past 3 years. It appears the market has recognized our consistent financial performance and significant dividend increases over this period. Although we have made good progress increasing our PE multiples, we still have more work to do to fully eliminate the peer discount. A few weeks ago, we raised the dividend 14% to a payout level of 62% which is in line with our peers. This is a sign of the Board's confidence with our progress and with our long-term business outlook. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the results in 2011 and look forward to building on our success in 2012. One of our top priorities in 2012 is to focus on our customers' needs. As fundamental as this may seen, we can do a better job. Last year, we launched the customer value initiative, which focuses on moving up the value chain. We will talk more about this important initiative next week at our Investor Meeting. 
We also want to firmly align with you, our shareholders. We will continue to be transparent with our business model, clearly identifying the financial and operational metrics most important to you and delivering the results. We are fortunate to have a good energy law in Michigan that provides the foundation for investment decisions and lays the groundwork for regulatory decisions. However I believe there is room for improvement, for improvement in the process that will be in the best interest of all parties. I believe the few process changes could make Michigan's regulatory model one of the best in the country. 
Risk is one of the key elements of any investment or business decision. We focus on identifying financial and business risk and evaluating the alternatives along with the cost of mitigation. I have confidence that we have mitigated as much risk as possible or have backup plans in place for the various risks we may encounter. We are establishing our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance at $1.52 to $1.55 per share and a tight range of 5% to 7%. This should support continued TSR performance in the 9% to 11% range. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to share more insights about 2011 and 2012."
257682,145708030,284547,"CMS Energy Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2012",2012-02-23,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Let me welcome to everybody on the call today. Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace. That evolved into 6% to 8% a year. We met that goal and we met it at t",1809,"Thanks, John. Let me welcome to everybody on the call today. Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace. That evolved into 6% to 8% a year. We met that goal and we met it at the high end of the range. We dipped once in 2007 to reflect the planned sale of international assets before the full-year benefits kicked in. The full year benefit of lower debt and interest expense and higher utility equity and earnings occurred in 2008 as planned. This major sale made possible our consistently strong earnings performance. 
In 2010, we moved to increase certainty of our investor return. We shifted a bit towards dividend yield by increasing our dividend 40% from a yield of about 3% to one at 4%. We also aligned our EPS growth outlook at 5% to 7% and started from the high performance accomplished in 2010. And as John just highlighted for you, we exceeded our EPS target last year continuing to perform at the high end of our projected range. Our dividend increase last month was the sixth in a row at $0.96 a share, it represents a 62% payout, and that's about the average of our peers. This combined with strong EPS growth should provide a healthy TSR and the good platform for continued growth. 
Equally reflective of our past performance and outlook is our continued operating cash flow growth. That's averaging about $100 million each year. This investment driven growth provides the capacity to enhance the dividend and the capacity to reduce parent debt when our investment needs ease. As you can see here, our 2011 earnings growth compared with 2010 was driven by our core business, the utility. The impact of soft energy prices on our ITPs was largely offset by refinancing in the attractive financial markets. And this performance isn't easily accomplished. 
Our team works hard every day to deliver it and here is a sampling of the ebbs and flows during 2011. As you can see in the green bulge on the left top of the slide, the cold winter a year ago provided financial capacity to accelerate reliability spending, specifically including more tree trimming than we originally have planned. As you can see in the red dip, around the spring time we had to pull back a little when record storms occurred, including ice storms double the level of previous years. The hot summer along with good tax and better than planned operating performance provided space for more customer reliability investment. We pushed hard last year and in prior years to balance our work in a manner that accelerates customer performance improvements and delivers consistent earnings growth. It's not easy but the model works well for our customers and you, our investors. 
So here is our final report card for 2011, all As. But there is no rest. We've been working on 2012 plans for more than a year. We are providing 2012 earnings guidance in a narrow range for the first time in many years at 5% to 7% resulting in earnings at $1.52 to $1.55 a share. As usual, we're building this off our results last year where we were already at the high end of our long-term growth range. So here is a look at the work ahead. We've already faced mild winter weather in January and February, and recall we do not have decoupling for weather in the gas business. Although adverse weather has cost us about a $0.05 a share so far this year, we are able to offset it. We're taking action to address additional mild weather if it's necessary and this is fully consistent with our strategic model. 
So how does it work in 2012? It's the same investment driven model we've used for several years, the same model that drives us for the next 5 years. Our customer-driven investment continues at a pace that grows rate base, EPS, and operating cash flow at about 5% to 7%. But why not invest less? Because there are investments -- these are investments that are needed to meet laws, regulations and responsible service levels for our customers. Then why not invest more? We work hard to prioritize the capital spending in a manner to keep our base rate increases at or below inflation, otherwise we don't think we're serving our customers in a responsible manner and one that would be sustainable for you. Importantly, many people across Michigan worked hard to establish the new State Energy Law in 2008. And we're fortunate to have fair regulation that supports that law. 
For 2012, our electric and gas rate cases are primarily about new capital investment. The investment represents 95% of the gas and 97% of the electric self-implementation levels. The gas case may be at a size that settled but we'll learn more about that later today. Staff positions on both cases reflect ROEs that are below the national average. They also include sales on uncollectible account levels below existing experience. As in our last 3 rounds of rate cases, the commission may choose to strike a balance that provides resources to continue needed investment and reflect existing conditions. 
We're fortunate that they have seen these needs and our commitment to serve customers. We're working diligently to keep our cost and customer rates low, but while incremental power prices are extraordinarily low, well below replacement costs, some customers seek to temporarily leave bundled service. Some of those not within the 10% cap established in the 2008 Energy Law have pressed for a higher cap. Key legislative and administrative leaders have reviewed the situation and chosen so far not to make any change during the period of artificially low prices. When prices return to a level that reflects replacement costs, our base load generation costs will provide clear advantages to all our bundled customers. 
Our model includes strong customer focus and we're pushing hard, in fact very hard to enhance service and minimize prices. We continue to deliver base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. To support this, we reduced O&M in our last 2 rate cases. We expect to keep our base rate case increases below 2% through the next 5 years. Our approach is to bring smaller, routine rate cases annually in order to simplify the process, avoid rate shocks and permit timely recovery of investment, the primary focus of each request. 
In the gas business, we expect that reductions in our GCR will result in savings to customers that more than offset increases over the next 3 years. We don't expect to be as fortunate in the electric utility, but we are continuing to work to slow the growth of fuel and PSCR costs. An important part of the plan to hold down rates includes reducing our O&M cost in a manner that enhances service while eliminating waste. 
In the last 2 years, we've reduced our headcount by 4% and this is a big contributor to our plan that not only offsets inflation but reduces total O&M cost by 4%. 
Over the next 5 years, we expect to lower O&M costs by a further 1% each year more than offsetting inflation costs and productivity. We're in the third year of economic recovery in Michigan which is shown here, weather adjusted electric sales up 2% in 2012. This helps all customers by spreading the impact of needed investment more broadly. During 2011, Michigan added 80,000 private sector jobs. 
Over the last 2 years, unemployment dropped 5 points from 14.1% to 9.3%. While U.S. unemployment dropped a point, Michigan ranked number one among all states in manufacturing growth up 13% and number 2 in construction growth up 3%. U.S. auto production is up 17% so far this year compared to last year. Used car prices are high and that's another signal of improving new car sales ahead. Clearly the revisions to business taxes, the auto recovery and the constructive approach to economic development are working. For example, in the most recent State Business Tax Climate Index update that came from a nonpartisan tax research group, Michigan advanced from 49 to number 7 among all 50 states. Pretty good track record. 
Although last on our list today, an important and unusual to most utilities element of our model includes the use of NOLs to provide -- to avoid the need for equity, not just for this year, not just for next year, but for the next 5 years. We plan routine drift [ph] in another small equity programs but no new block equity offerings over the next 5 years. Now clearly it's an appropriate business case presented itself, we wouldn't hesitate to bring it to you but we are able to self fund planned investments of about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years. 
Cash flow is healthy with 2012 utility operating cash flow at $1.6 billion, up another $125 million. Recall that we accelerated both parent debt funding and companywide pension contributions in 2011, eliminating the need for more pension funding this year or next year. 
We lowered our discount rates at the end of the year to 4.9%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year. We also lowered our expected return from 8% to 7.75%. The adverse earnings impact of about $0.03 a share was more than offset by the effect of our cash contributions to the pension fund. So as we do with parent debt, pre-funding the pension plan provides another strong measure of risk mitigation. 
Here is our routine profit and cash flow sensitivity chart, updated to address 2012. You can use this to easily reach your own estimate of our outlook. Now please note that we expect electric decoupling for energy efficiency to continue but we anticipate decoupling for economic and weather changes to end. We've highlighted that here in our sensitivities. Although we prefer to continue decoupling for economic increases or decreases, this probably provides an upside during the recovery. Please don't forget we'll seek to reinvest any gains should they occur in more reliability. Also please note the ROE sensitivity. We anticipate a reduction from existing authorized levels and you can see some possible impacts here.
So here is a recap of our targets for 2012 with important improvements over 2011. And don't forget the Investor Meeting that's scheduled for the New York Stock Exchange on February 29. You'll have a chance to hear from our executive team and join us in celebrating our 65th anniversary, or 65th year of listing on the New York Stock Exchange as well as our 125th year of proudly serving the people and the businesses of the State of Michigan. So John and I would be delighted now to take your questions operator, if you'd open the call."

And I think the focus ought to be, look at the big items. There is a difference in ROE which I know Dan credits us for evading that a little bit but there is a difference there and I have a funny feeling, there will be some good analysts to configure out our number from these. And on uncollectibles, it's simply recognizing a 3 year history rather than the present experience. So we're hopeful on that particular one that folks will acknowledge where we are today. And maybe do something creative, whether it's a tracker or whatever it maybe as a way of ensuring that we don't over recover on UAs [ph] because that's not our intent. We just want to recover whatever the experience is. On investment, there is some very small pipeline things that are in discussion right now. Generally it's hard to find an example where we've ever been turned down on investments. So as long as there is confidence we're doing the right thing, I think we'll get proper recovery on the investments. So there is not really a big terrible issue there. And on revenue it's a little bit -- this isn't really the mainstream revenue, this is sort of the buy-sells that we do that kind of thing in the gas business. And this is again staff taking a looking at a 3 year history rather our most recent experience. And if you look at what's actually happening today, I think that we can find common ground on that one as well. And O&M is sort of a little bag of a variety of different things. So the impression that you might get there is that we may not be as far apart as it appears and when you think of the size of where we are, it's probably something that could move toward settlement, those things take a little bit of time though. And we'll see, that will up to the staff and the commission and all the other parties too."

And I'll give you an example that kind of relates to that. We work hard to bring the O&M cost down because we don't benefit from that except in the short-term that's a way of creating headroom and helping our customers and offset the recovery we get from the capital investments that we are putting in place for them. This year, we're able to take our O&M costs down by about 4%. That maybe one of the best that we've done when I look through modern history our track record has always been up more closer to inflation levels. But we are blowing the inflation away and we're going to 0 and we're not stopping, we're going down. We told you here that we are looking for the forward years to be flat to 1% down, but as we get closer to each year that's when we work harder to do the things that provide the productivity that make a lot of sense. And I'll give you one example. Hardening the system is something that we've been doing for some time. We put investment in place to put better poles, better wires, better pipes in place and by doing that, when storms and problems like that that are O&M related occur, we don't have as much problem. We don't have as much damage. And I think that a team that's focused on improving all the time finds and surprises itself with how much it can do. So if there are limits, of course there is a point where we can't go much further and therefore do actions that jeopardize the service that our customers would get. Do we put a number on a cap on it? No. And so we'll -- I can tell you this, this will give you a little help. We didn't anticipate $0.05 a bad news in the weather in January and February where we don't have any decoupling on the weather side for the gas business. So that wasn't easy but we've gone off and we've already have all the plans in place to fully accommodate that. We expect that the weather is pretty mild. You don't have the benefit of this but I am looking out the window here in Jackson, Michigan. I wouldn't say put your bathing suit on but it's a little more pleasant than what we might normally see this time of year. So we're putting some work together to figure out what we can do."

This isn't to say that somebody may not introduce the bill to increase the cap or do something different but I think the Governor's interest is more in infrastructure investments, finding a way to make investments in infrastructure which creates jobs and benefits the state in a long-term basis. It also would help the infrastructure that I think he is worried about which is the road infrastructure. I think, as you know, as we go in and do replace pipes and mains and services, it does cause havoc in the roads but after it's completed the roads are replaced. So it may be a nice combination in the future to be able to replace the infrastructure where you have gas mains at the same time have the infrastructure of the roads replaced at the same time."

We have a goal inside the company to try to keep that debt flat or bring it down. I would like to 2 points about it. One is that with all the bonus depreciation that we've been getting each of the last few years including 100% last year. It's been wonderful but it all happens in the utility and creates a bubble at the parent debt because we aren't able to use our NOLs to shelter taxes because they are already sheltered down at the utility. So for that reason you see a little bubble up, we don't like it, but we know it's very temporary and we're still on our trajectory to bring that down as we go through time. So that's our plan. But the second point is the reason we're not bringing it down at an even faster clip is simply because when we invest in the utility, we get that 10% to 11% after-tax return. And when we take out the parent debt, we only get a 4% to 5% after-tax return. So the comparison on the economics is real simple. But we'll talk to you more. Hope you'll be with us too. We'll talk to you more in New York to remind you about the things we do to ensure that we are well protected like thick liquidity and pre-funding and all that so the parent debt won't be an issue. And as we keep growing the utility, the cash flow grows through time and it gets to a very high level which was the point in the slide. So that when your spending comes off a little bit, you can put that to use in more dividend or you can put it in use to parent debt reduction, there will be a lot of wonderful choices that we're creating for ourselves.

Let me begin the presentation today with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we'll close with Q&A. 
First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.37, down $0.14 from 2011. The results were impacted by the warmest winter on record in Michigan, reducing earnings by $0.13 this year and $0.18 compared to the colder than normal weather a year ago. 
The good news is, we've identified a number of actions some of which have already been implemented to offset the adverse weather. Tom will discuss several of these with you later. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share. 
On the regulatory side, our electric and gas rate cases are proceeding on schedule. I'll give you an update on these two in a minute. In early April, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in a DTE case that the Michigan Public Service Commission lacks statutory authority to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism for electric utilities. As the result of this decision, we wrote off a $59 million regulatory asset covering the period from December 2009 through November of 2011. 
The Court's ruling does not affect our 2012 adjusted earnings guidance since the electric decoupling mechanism was only authorized through November of last year. And I also am going to talk about the bill to raise the retail open assess cap in Michigan and give you an overview on the operations for the quarter. 
Many of you are familiar with our rate case timeline. We are nearing the deadline for the Commission to issue a final order in our electric rate case. All of the testimony and briefs are filed and the staff in ALG have filed their recommendations. The final order is due no later than June 8. 
The gas rate case is scheduled for a final order by August 31. Because of the limited size of the case, there's a chance we could settle this case. In March, a bill was introduced to raise the retail open access cap. We are opposed to this bill, which would benefit a relatively small number of business customers at the cost of all other customers. There is wide spread opposition against the bill including the Chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and the Chair of the House Energy and Technology Committee. 
Both have publically voiced their opinion that the 2008 energy law is working with regard to the cap and have no intention of taking action on the bill. If enacted, it would allow all customers on the waiting list to go to ROA, retail open access, and then permit further annual increases in the cap to about 40% by 2016. This would shift up to $400 million of cost to our remaining customers.
We will continue to inform key members of the legislature and the administration of the consequences to our remaining customers if this bill is passed. 
Let me give you a brief update on operations. Major construction continues on our 100 MW Lake Winds Energy Park. Concrete foundations are nearly complete and wind turbine components are being delivered. The facility is scheduled to begin operations later this year. 
Low natural gas prices have resulted in record monthly send-out at our Zeeland natural gas power generation facility. In February the combined cycle portion of the plant set a record capacity factor of 86% compared to 11% for all of 2008. The acquisition of the Zeeland plant in 2007 has been a great addition to our generation fleet and has helped us to maintain a balanced energy portfolio. 
Low natural gas prices will also generate savings for our gas customers. Starting in April, the commodity portion of our customers' bill was reduced by 13%. We project our customers will save more than $100 million over the next 12 months and $300 million over the next two years. 
Ironically, many of our customers who have switched to an alternative supplier are paying more for their gas than our bundled customers. This month, we offered a voluntary separation program to all salaried employees similar to the programs we offered in 2006 and 2009. This decision was driven by our goal to ensure that we are properly staffed to serve our customers effectively and to run our business efficiently. We have informed the union leadership of this program and are in discussions with them to explore a similar program for our union employees. 
Our business model has been working well for several years. It relies on good regulatory and legislative framework and a disciplined execution by the management team. This supports a customer-driven investment plan with customer rate increases that are affordable at about the rate of inflation. With this model we have delivered consistent cash flow and earnings growth in the past and we expect it will continue for many years. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results, if he can get through it with his cold.

Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results. Excluding the decoupling write-off that John just talked about, adjusted earnings were $0.37 a share and this is down $0.14 from last year reflecting the record warm winter. 
On a weather-adjusted basis earnings were $0.50 and that's up $0.04 from last year. Now, we are writing off our electric decoupling regulator asset because we no longer assess recovery as at least 80% probable. Two weeks ago the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not have statutory authority for electric decoupling. Although gas decoupling is expressly addressed in the 2008 energy law and the intent may have been to include the electric business as well, the Appeals Court judge found that in a plain reading of the law, electric decoupling was established.
This appeals case brought by ABATE against the Michigan Public Service Commission regarding the DTE rate case order reduces our confidence in recovery. The standard to maintain such a revenue regulatory asset is high. Please recall that for planning purposes we had assumed that present and future electric decoupling for the economy and weather was discontinued in any event. We were however surprised by the Appeals Court order and have taken the one-time write-off of the anticipated $0.14 recovery as you can see on this chart. 
Now importantly, gas decoupling continues and you see the numbers on the chart for that. And energy optimization incentives also continue for both electric and the gas business as shown above. In our service territory, the first quarter weather was the warmest on record. Personally, I'm hoping the graph shown here that looks like half an ice cream cone, will look more like a full cone later. But kidding aside, we take this very seriously and we do not dismiss weather as an excuse to miss our earnings or our operational goals. 
A few weeks ago we estimated the adverse weather impact at $0.16 when we gave you a look ahead. But as you can see here the final data came in at $0.13. We have a plan in place to offset the $0.13 of adverse profit associated with the warm winter weather. Some of the actions are natural offsets. For example, with lower sales, pressure on customer bills eased and uncollectible accounts declined a bit. 
With less gas flowing through the system, less gas was lost. On the other hand, hard work is also paying off. Our major multi year effort to improve employee safety has resulted in more employees going home safely each day and therefore we have fewer injuries. Fewer injuries reduces the size of our injuries and damages reserved too. More good news. And you can that, all this detail, with the earnings numbers on the right hand side of this slide. 
Although the weather is not the reason we are reshaping and resizing our team with a voluntary restructuring program to better meet the needs of our customers. In total, our recovery actions offset adverse weather of the $0.13 a share. $0.08 or 60% of that work is complete, done, and $0.05 is underway including the voluntary restructuring program. 
Now as you can see here, strong cost discipline, the continuing sale recovery and rate cases help us keep right on track to earn our $1.52 to $1.55 a share for this year. The Michigan economy continues to recover at a faster pace than the nation with unemployment for example down six points from the recession peak but still above 8%. The US unemployment levels are down two points from the recession peak but also still a bit above 8%. 
US auto sales provide an indicator of recovery in Michigan. Sales were up sharply. US production also is up; 18% so far just this year. Finished vehicle inventories remain low at 54 days supply and a 60 to 90-days supply is more normal. This and continuing used car prices bode well for the new car sales ahead. 
As you can see here, the economic recovery in our service territory in Michigan continues in its third year with industrial sales at pre-recession levels last year. Industrial sales were up 10% in 2010, 4% in 2011 and we expect another lift of about 6% this year. Total weather adjusted sales were up 5% over the last three years. As shown at the top of the bar sales were of course higher excluding energy efficiencies and that may be a clearer measure of the underlying economic growth in our service territory. 
The recovery over the same three-year period was about 8% instead of 5%. Perhaps many people including us have been under calling the resiliency of the economic recovery in Michigan. A key aspect of our recovery includes our passion about maintaining responsible customer rate increases at or below the level of inflation. 
Our earnings and cash flow growth is based primarily on capital investment and rate base growth. Our forecast of spending over the 2012 to 2016 period continues at $6.6 billion. We've had lots of opportunities to increase the size of this but have continued to prioritize in a manner to fit in more content without increasing the total. With faster than planned replacement of pipes and poles, quicker implementation of the smart grid and a modest increase in gas generation capacity, we easily could be spending $10 billion. 
This would however require increases in base rates of more than 4% a year, which we don't believe is reasonable or sustainable year in and year out. The precise spending level of $6.6 billion is not critical but the general goal of holding down base rate increases is important to us. 
Our liquidity as a percent of market cap continues at a strong level and it's nearly twice as thick as most of our peers. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we just renewed our $150 million revolver for five years at more attractive terms maturing in 2017. Keeping a thick level of liquidity, pre-funding our parent debt maturities a couple of years in advance and maintaining a strong backup plan continues what some of you have called our healthy belt, suspenders and sky hook approach. 
Recently Fitch upgraded our utility ratings with secure debt rated at A-, up a notch. Moody's has moved the utility and CMS from stable to positive outlook. And we welcome these votes of confidence in the plan. 
And here's our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. This is our sensitivity ready-reckoner chart for 2012. With three of four convertibles now retired, the dilution exposure has been reduced substantially. So we'll drop the sensitivity in the next quarter's chart. 
With more gas requirements contracted our cash flow sensitivity to changes in gas prices is minimized from what we showed you a quarter ago at $60 million per dollar of gas price to $25 million as we show here. Now, we are however adding coal inventory with the shift of economic burn from coal to gas. We expect that higher than planned inventories will adversely impact working capital by about $50 million compared with planned. 
We've taken steps to mitigate this but we do have more work to do. 
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures as shown here. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business, operationally and from a regulatory standpoint. 
Now let me sort of end the formal part of the presentation before we take questions with my own good wishes to Laura and my deep appreciation for her being my business partner over the last decade. 
With her leadership, we avoided the abyss of bankruptcy, totally restructured both consumers and CMS balance sheets and helped restore consistency and integrity. Few companies have been on such a steep roller coaster and then delivered nine years of consistent earnings growth. We thank you, Laura, and we will miss you. 
So, thank you all for joining us today and John and I would be happy to take questions now. So, Grant, if you'd open the lines, we'd appreciate that and apologies again to, everybody, for coughing at you during the call.

But there are other ways that we can get around this and I don't really want - and we're not getting around the law, but other things the regulators can do and I think that's why they're asking for the utilities to respond back to them in the next few weeks to decide what approach do we use. As Tom said, they resolved the - they ensured that the trackers - they supported trackers so there's ways you can track revenue. There's way you can track other things, which is fine.

So there are opportunities. We'll have to see what the Commission decides to do, what DTE decides to do and then we will certainly support what we can in that case.

But even peaking, even the simple cycle has dispatched some coal on a certain, some certain timeframes. So we're seeing that as an advantage that we have the gas plants. A disadvantage that we're really cycling the coal plants a lot more than we have in the past and right now some of the coal plants are out market. So it kind of fell in line with the strategy that we've had is to take some of these older units and mothball them in the next couple of years anyway.

The downside is those coal inventories that I mentioned are a little high but a benefit is our PSCR costs are dropping sharply benefiting from these low gas prices. So you remember we talked a lot about keeping our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. But we said GCR cost and PSCR costs were important to us. GCR cost are obviously negative each year creating lots of headroom for our customers. And PSCR costs, which we've been worried about, they're now half the size we were looking at maybe the last time we talked to you, everyone in New York. 
So there's a lot of benefits that come through this.

But the - also the belief we have that by 2015 when we see some of the environmental rules, math’s and others go into effect, what we’re going to see is capacity prices rise, gas prices begin to trickle up at that point and at that point, there's - we believe that these high efficient coal plants will be in the money.

But all the other assumptions you'd look at, we plan on normal weather, for example, and last year we were cooking. So there would be an upside if that were to happen again.
On the other hand, if it were a very mild summer, we'd have to take a hard look at what we’re doing. That would be a big challenge on top of this mild winter. So I would say look for normal things not extraordinary things. Normal weather, reasonable recovery in our rate cases and the like, as you look for the future numbers. We've tried not to be aggressive anywhere here.
One thing that John and I probably didn’t make really clear is that none of the recovery items we've shown you today cause us to do anything to the business that we think is unusual or make any sense. Sometimes you’ll hear us talk about if we got some upside we'll put some more money in tree trimming or even the other way around. We haven’t touched our forestry program. We haven’t touched our outage program, because we want all of those things to hold their own if we can. We've worked at the things that are all good business decisions.

Let me begin the presentation today with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year.

Let me begin the presentation today with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.37, down $0.14 from 2011. The results were impacted by the warmest winter on record in Michigan, reducing earnings per share by $0.13 this year and $0.18 compared to the colder than normal weather a year ago.
The good news is, we've identified a number of actions some of which have already been implemented to offset the adverse weather. Tom will discuss several of these with you later. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
On the regulatory side, our electric and gas rate cases are proceeding on schedule. I'll give you an update on these 2 in a minute. In early April, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in a DTE case that the Michigan Public Service Commission lacks statutory authority to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism for electric utilities. As the result of this decision, we wrote off a $59 million regulatory asset covering the period from December 2009 through November of 2011.
The Court's ruling does not affect our 2012 adjusted earnings guidance since the electric decoupling mechanism was only authorized through November of last year. And I also am going to talk about the bill to raise the retail open access cap in Michigan and give you an overview on the operations for the quarter.
Many of you are familiar with our rate case timeline. We are nearing the deadline for the Commission to issue a final order in our electric rate case. All of the testimony and briefs are filed and the staff in ALG have filed their recommendations. The final order is due no later than June 8.
The gas rate case is scheduled for a final order by August 31. Because of the limited size of the case, there's a chance we could settle this case. In March, a bill was introduced to raise the retail open access cap. We are opposed to this bill, which would benefit a relatively small number of business customers at the cost of all other customers. There is wide spread opposition against the bill including the Chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and the Chair of the House Energy and Technology Committee.
Both have publically voiced their opinion that the 2008 energy law is working with regard to the cap and have no intention of taking action on the bill. If enacted, it would allow all customers on the waiting list to go to ROA, retail open access, and then permit further annual increases in the cap to about 40% by 2016. This would shift up to $400 million of cost to our remaining customers.
We will continue to inform key members of the legislature and the administration of the consequences to our remaining customers if this bill is passed.
Let me give you a brief update on operations. Major construction continues on our 100 MW Lake Winds Energy Park. Concrete foundations are nearly complete and wind turbine components are being delivered. The facility is scheduled to begin operations later this year.
Low natural gas prices have resulted in record monthly send-out at our Zeeland natural gas power generation facility. In February the combined cycle portion of the plant set a record capacity factor of 86% compared to 11% for all of 2008. The acquisition of the Zeeland plant in 2007 has been a great addition to our generation fleet and has helped us to maintain a balanced energy portfolio.
Low natural gas prices will also generate savings for our gas customers. Starting in April, the commodity portion of our customers' bill was reduced by 13%. We project our customers will save more than $100 million over the next 12 months and $300 million over the next 2 years.
Ironically, many of our customers who have switched to an alternative supplier are paying more for their gas than our bundled customers. This month, we offered a voluntary separation program to all salaried employees similar to the programs we offered in 2006 and 2009. This decision was driven by our goal to ensure that we are properly staffed to serve our customers effectively and to run our business efficiently. We have informed the union leadership of this program and are in discussions with them to explore a similar program for our union employees.
Our business model has been working well for several years. It relies on good regulatory and legislative framework and a disciplined execution by the management team. This supports a customer-driven investment plan with customer rate increases that are affordable at about the rate of inflation. With this model we have delivered consistent cash flow and earnings growth in the past and we expect it will continue for many years.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results, if he can get through it with his cold."

But my apologies to everybody. I'm coming through with a little bronchitis today. Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results.

Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results. Excluding the decoupling write-off that John just talked about, adjusted earnings were $0.37 a share and this is down $0.14 from last year reflecting the record warm winter.
On a weather-adjusted basis earnings were $0.50 and that's up $0.04 from last year. Now, we are writing off our electric decoupling regulatory asset because we no longer assess recovery as at least 80% probable. Two weeks ago the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not have statutory authority for electric decoupling. Although gas decoupling is expressly addressed in the 2008 energy law and the intent may have been to include the electric business as well, the Appeals Court judge found that in a plain reading of the law, electric decoupling was not established.
This appeals case brought by ABATE against the Michigan Public Service Commission regarding the DTE rate case order reduces our confidence in recovery. The standard to maintain such a revenue regulatory asset is high. Please recall that for planning purposes we had assumed that present and future electric decoupling for the economy and weather was discontinued in any event. We were however surprised by the Appeals Court order and have taken the one-time write-off of the anticipated $0.14 recovery as you can see on this chart.
Now importantly, gas decoupling continues and you see the numbers on the chart for that. And energy optimization incentives also continue for both electric and the gas business as shown above. In our service territory, the first quarter weather was the warmest on record. Personally, I'm hoping the graph shown here that looks like half an ice cream cone, will look more like a full cone later. But kidding aside, we take this very seriously and we do not dismiss weather as an excuse to miss our earnings or our operational goals.
A few weeks ago we estimated the adverse weather impact at $0.16 when we gave you a look ahead. But as you can see here the final data came in at $0.13. We have a plan in place to offset the $0.13 of adverse profit associated with the warm winter weather. Some of the actions are natural offsets. For example, with lower sales, pressure on customer bills eased and uncollectible accounts declined a bit.
With less gas flowing through the system, less gas was lost. On the other hand, hard work is also paying off. Our major multiyear effort to improve employee safety has resulted in more employees going home safely each day and therefore we have fewer injuries. Fewer injuries reduces the size of our injuries and damages reserve too. More good news. And you can that, all this detail, with the earnings numbers on the right hand side of this slide.
Although the weather is not the reason we are reshaping and resizing our team with a voluntary restructuring program to better meet the needs of our customers. In total, our recovery actions offset adverse weather of the $0.13 a share. $0.08 or 60% of that work is complete, done, and $0.05 is underway including the voluntary restructuring program.
Now as you can see here, strong cost discipline, the continuing sales recovery and rate cases help us keep right on track to earn our $1.52 to $1.55 a share for this year. The Michigan economy continues to recover at a faster pace than the nation with unemployment for example down 6 points from the recession peak but still above 8%. The US unemployment levels are down 2 points from the recession peak but also still a bit above 8%.
U.S. auto sales provide an indicator of recovery in Michigan. Sales were up sharply. U.S. production also is up; 18% so far just this year. Finished vehicle inventories remain low at 54 day supply and at 60 to 90-day supply is more normal. This and continuing used car prices bode well for the new car sales ahead.
As you can see here, the economic recovery in our service territory in Michigan continues in its third year with industrial sales at pre-recession levels last year. Industrial sales were up 10% in 2010, 4% in 2011 and we expect another lift of about 6% this year. Total weather adjusted sales were up 5% over the last 3 years. As shown at the top of the bar sales were of course higher excluding energy efficiencies and that may be a clearer measure of the underlying economic growth in our service territory.
The recovery over the same 3-year period was about 8% instead of 5%. Perhaps many people including us have been under calling the resiliency of the economic recovery in Michigan. A key aspect of our recovery includes our passion about maintaining responsible customer rate increases at or below the level of inflation.
Our earnings and cash flow growth is based primarily on capital investment and rate base growth. Our forecast of spending over the 2012 to 2016 period continues at $6.6 billion. We've had lots of opportunities to increase the size of this but have continued to prioritize in a manner to fit in more content without increasing the total. With faster than planned replacement of pipes and poles, quicker implementation of the smart grid and a modest increase in gas generation capacity, we easily could be spending $10 billion.
This would however require increases in base rates of more than 4% a year, which we don't believe is reasonable or sustainable year in and year out. The precise spending level of $6.6 billion is not critical but the general goal of holding down base rate increases is important to us.
Our liquidity as a percent of market cap continues at a strong level and it's nearly twice as thick as most of our peers. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we just renewed our $150 million revolver for 5 years at more attractive terms maturing in 2017. Keeping a thick level of liquidity, pre-funding our parent debt maturities a couple of years in advance and maintaining a strong backup plan continues what some of you have called our healthy belt, suspenders and sky hook approach.
Recently Fitch upgraded our utility ratings with secure debt rated at A-, up a notch. Moody's has moved the utility and CMS from stable to positive outlook. And we welcome these votes of confidence in the plan.
And here's our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. This is our sensitivity ready-reckoner chart for 2012. With 3 of 4 convertibles now retired, the dilution exposure has been reduced substantially. So we'll drop the sensitivity in the next quarter's chart.
With more gas requirements contracted our cash flow sensitivity to changes in gas prices is minimized from what we showed you a quarter ago at $60 million per dollar of gas price to $25 million as we show here. Now, we are however adding coal inventory with the shift of economic burn from coal to gas. We expect that higher than planned inventories will adversely impact working capital by about $50 million compared with planned.
We've taken steps to mitigate this but we do have more work to do.
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures as shown here. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business, operationally and from a regulatory standpoint.
Now let me sort of end the formal part of the presentation before we take questions with my own good wishes to Laura and my deep appreciation for her being my business partner over the last decade.
With her leadership, we avoided the abyss of bankruptcy, totally restructured both consumers and CMS balance sheets and helped restore consistency and integrity. Few companies have been on such a steep roller coaster and then delivered 9 years of consistent earnings growth. We thank you, Laura, and we will miss you.
So, thank you all for joining us today and John and I would be happy to take questions now. So, Grant, if you'd open the lines, we'd appreciate that and apologies again to, everybody, for coughing at you during the call."

The underway would be your interesting side because under efficiencies includes the restructuring program that John just described that we're doing.

But there are other ways that we can get around this and I don't really want - and we're not getting around the law, but other things the regulators can do and I think that's why they're asking for the utilities to respond back to them in the next few weeks to decide what approach do we use. As Tom said, they resolved the - they ensured that the trackers - they supported trackers so there's ways you can track revenue. There's way you can track other things, which is fine. And I'm glad to see they endorsed that during the hearing so that'll be a published case, which means that, that should have a lot of substance in the future for how we actually go about looking at this.
So there are opportunities. We'll have to see what the Commission decides to do, what DTE decides to do and then we will certainly support what we can in that case."

We've even seen at times that the - certainly the combined cycle is dispatched ahead of coal at times, particularly some of our coal plans. But even peaking, even the simple cycle has dispatched some coal on a certain, some certain timeframes. So we're seeing that as an advantage that we have the gas plants. A disadvantage that we're really cycling the coal plants a lot more than we have in the past and right now some of the coal plants are out of market. So it kind of fell in line with the strategy that we've had is to take some of these older units and mothball them in the next couple of years anyway."

So I won’t add much to that except to say that we try to self-implement the appropriate numbers so that there isn’t a large refund of any kind and just do the right thing there. But all the other assumptions you'd look at, we plan on normal weather, for example, and last year we were cooking. So there would be an upside if that were to happen again.
On the other hand, if it were a very mild summer, we'd have to take a hard look at what we’re doing. That would be a big challenge on top of this mild winter. So I would say look for normal things not extraordinary things. Normal weather, reasonable recovery in our rate cases and the like, as you look for the future numbers. We've tried not to be aggressive anywhere here.
One thing that John and I probably didn’t make really clear is that none of the recovery items we've shown you today cause us to do anything to the business that we think is unusual or make any sense. Sometimes you’ll hear us talk about if we got some upside we'll put some more money in tree trimming or even the other way around. We haven’t touched our forestry program.

Let me begin the presentation today with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.37, down $0.14 from 2011. The results were impacted by the warmest winter on record in Michigan, reducing earnings per share by $0.13 this year and $0.18 compared to the colder than normal weather a year ago.
The good news is, we've identified a number of actions some of which have already been implemented to offset the adverse weather. Tom will discuss several of these with you later. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
On the regulatory side, our electric and gas rate cases are proceeding on schedule. I'll give you an update on these 2 in a minute. In early April, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in a DTE case that the Michigan Public Service Commission lacks statutory authority to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism for electric utilities. As the result of this decision, we wrote off a $59 million regulatory asset covering the period from December 2009 through November of 2011.
The Court's ruling does not affect our 2012 adjusted earnings guidance since the electric decoupling mechanism was only authorized through November of last year. And I also am going to talk about the bill to raise the retail open access cap in Michigan and give you an overview on the operations for the quarter.
Many of you are familiar with our rate case timeline. We are nearing the deadline for the Commission to issue a final order in our electric rate case. All of the testimony and briefs are filed and the staff in ALG have filed their recommendations. The final order is due no later than June 8.
The gas rate case is scheduled for a final order by August 31. Because of the limited size of the case, there's a chance we could settle this case. In March, a bill was introduced to raise the retail open access cap. We are opposed to this bill, which would benefit a relatively small number of business customers at the cost of all other customers. There is wide spread opposition against the bill including the Chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and the Chair of the House Energy and Technology Committee.
Both have publically voiced their opinion that the 2008 energy law is working with regard to the cap and have no intention of taking action on the bill. If enacted, it would allow all customers on the waiting list to go to ROA, retail open access, and then permit further annual increases in the cap to about 40% by 2016. This would shift up to $400 million of cost to our remaining customers.
We will continue to inform key members of the legislature and the administration of the consequences to our remaining customers if this bill is passed.
Let me give you a brief update on operations. Major construction continues on our 100 MW Lake Winds Energy Park. Concrete foundations are nearly complete and wind turbine components are being delivered. The facility is scheduled to begin operations later this year.
Low natural gas prices have resulted in record monthly send-out at our Zeeland natural gas power generation facility. In February the combined cycle portion of the plant set a record capacity factor of 86% compared to 11% for all of 2008. The acquisition of the Zeeland plant in 2007 has been a great addition to our generation fleet and has helped us to maintain a balanced energy portfolio.
Low natural gas prices will also generate savings for our gas customers. Starting in April, the commodity portion of our customers' bill was reduced by 13%. We project our customers will save more than $100 million over the next 12 months and $300 million over the next 2 years.
Ironically, many of our customers who have switched to an alternative supplier are paying more for their gas than our bundled customers. This month, we offered a voluntary separation program to all salaried employees similar to the programs we offered in 2006 and 2009. This decision was driven by our goal to ensure that we are properly staffed to serve our customers effectively and to run our business efficiently. We have informed the union leadership of this program and are in discussions with them to explore a similar program for our union employees.
Our business model has been working well for several years. It relies on good regulatory and legislative framework and a disciplined execution by the management team. This supports a customer-driven investment plan with customer rate increases that are affordable at about the rate of inflation. With this model we have delivered consistent cash flow and earnings growth in the past and we expect it will continue for many years.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results, if he can get through it with his cold."

But my apologies to everybody. I'm coming through with a little bronchitis today. Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results. Excluding the decoupling write-off that John just talked about, adjuste",1389,"My apologies to every - thanks, John. But my apologies to everybody. I'm coming through with a little bronchitis today. Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results. Excluding the decoupling write-off that John just talked about, adjusted earnings were $0.37 a share and this is down $0.14 from last year reflecting the record warm winter.
On a weather-adjusted basis earnings were $0.50 and that's up $0.04 from last year. Now, we are writing off our electric decoupling regulatory asset because we no longer assess recovery as at least 80% probable. Two weeks ago the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not have statutory authority for electric decoupling. Although gas decoupling is expressly addressed in the 2008 energy law and the intent may have been to include the electric business as well, the Appeals Court judge found that in a plain reading of the law, electric decoupling was not established.
This appeals case brought by ABATE against the Michigan Public Service Commission regarding the DTE rate case order reduces our confidence in recovery. The standard to maintain such a revenue regulatory asset is high. Please recall that for planning purposes we had assumed that present and future electric decoupling for the economy and weather was discontinued in any event. We were however surprised by the Appeals Court order and have taken the one-time write-off of the anticipated $0.14 recovery as you can see on this chart.
Now importantly, gas decoupling continues and you see the numbers on the chart for that. And energy optimization incentives also continue for both electric and the gas business as shown above. In our service territory, the first quarter weather was the warmest on record. Personally, I'm hoping the graph shown here that looks like half an ice cream cone, will look more like a full cone later. But kidding aside, we take this very seriously and we do not dismiss weather as an excuse to miss our earnings or our operational goals.
A few weeks ago we estimated the adverse weather impact at $0.16 when we gave you a look ahead. But as you can see here the final data came in at $0.13. We have a plan in place to offset the $0.13 of adverse profit associated with the warm winter weather. Some of the actions are natural offsets. For example, with lower sales, pressure on customer bills eased and uncollectible accounts declined a bit.
With less gas flowing through the system, less gas was lost. On the other hand, hard work is also paying off. Our major multiyear effort to improve employee safety has resulted in more employees going home safely each day and therefore we have fewer injuries. Fewer injuries reduces the size of our injuries and damages reserve too. More good news. And you can that, all this detail, with the earnings numbers on the right hand side of this slide.
Although the weather is not the reason we are reshaping and resizing our team with a voluntary restructuring program to better meet the needs of our customers. In total, our recovery actions offset adverse weather of the $0.13 a share. $0.08 or 60% of that work is complete, done, and $0.05 is underway including the voluntary restructuring program.
Now as you can see here, strong cost discipline, the continuing sales recovery and rate cases help us keep right on track to earn our $1.52 to $1.55 a share for this year. The Michigan economy continues to recover at a faster pace than the nation with unemployment for example down 6 points from the recession peak but still above 8%. The US unemployment levels are down 2 points from the recession peak but also still a bit above 8%.
U.S. auto sales provide an indicator of recovery in Michigan. Sales were up sharply. U.S. production also is up; 18% so far just this year. Finished vehicle inventories remain low at 54 day supply and at 60 to 90-day supply is more normal. This and continuing used car prices bode well for the new car sales ahead.
As you can see here, the economic recovery in our service territory in Michigan continues in its third year with industrial sales at pre-recession levels last year. Industrial sales were up 10% in 2010, 4% in 2011 and we expect another lift of about 6% this year. Total weather adjusted sales were up 5% over the last 3 years. As shown at the top of the bar sales were of course higher excluding energy efficiencies and that may be a clearer measure of the underlying economic growth in our service territory.
The recovery over the same 3-year period was about 8% instead of 5%. Perhaps many people including us have been under calling the resiliency of the economic recovery in Michigan. A key aspect of our recovery includes our passion about maintaining responsible customer rate increases at or below the level of inflation.
Our earnings and cash flow growth is based primarily on capital investment and rate base growth. Our forecast of spending over the 2012 to 2016 period continues at $6.6 billion. We've had lots of opportunities to increase the size of this but have continued to prioritize in a manner to fit in more content without increasing the total. With faster than planned replacement of pipes and poles, quicker implementation of the smart grid and a modest increase in gas generation capacity, we easily could be spending $10 billion.
This would however require increases in base rates of more than 4% a year, which we don't believe is reasonable or sustainable year in and year out. The precise spending level of $6.6 billion is not critical but the general goal of holding down base rate increases is important to us.
Our liquidity as a percent of market cap continues at a strong level and it's nearly twice as thick as most of our peers. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we just renewed our $150 million revolver for 5 years at more attractive terms maturing in 2017. Keeping a thick level of liquidity, pre-funding our parent debt maturities a couple of years in advance and maintaining a strong backup plan continues what some of you have called our healthy belt, suspenders and sky hook approach.
Recently Fitch upgraded our utility ratings with secure debt rated at A-, up a notch. Moody's has moved the utility and CMS from stable to positive outlook. And we welcome these votes of confidence in the plan.
And here's our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. This is our sensitivity ready-reckoner chart for 2012. With 3 of 4 convertibles now retired, the dilution exposure has been reduced substantially. So we'll drop the sensitivity in the next quarter's chart.
With more gas requirements contracted our cash flow sensitivity to changes in gas prices is minimized from what we showed you a quarter ago at $60 million per dollar of gas price to $25 million as we show here. Now, we are however adding coal inventory with the shift of economic burn from coal to gas. We expect that higher than planned inventories will adversely impact working capital by about $50 million compared with planned.
We've taken steps to mitigate this but we do have more work to do.
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures as shown here. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business, operationally and from a regulatory standpoint.
Now let me sort of end the formal part of the presentation before we take questions with my own good wishes to Laura and my deep appreciation for her being my business partner over the last decade.
With her leadership, we avoided the abyss of bankruptcy, totally restructured both consumers and CMS balance sheets and helped restore consistency and integrity. Few companies have been on such a steep roller coaster and then delivered 9 years of consistent earnings growth. We thank you, Laura, and we will miss you.
So, thank you all for joining us today and John and I would be happy to take questions now. So, Grant, if you'd open the lines, we'd appreciate that and apologies again to, everybody, for coughing at you during the call."

The underway would be your interesting side because under efficiencies includes the restructuring program that John just described that we're doing. And on the economy, we are seeing a stronger tick-up in sales so there's a little piece of sales that's flowing through that we just didn't anticipate and we're still using our approach of being pretty conservative.
We'd rather be wrong and surprised on the favorable side on this sort of thing. But it looked so good that we pretty much had to pick it up.

But there are other ways that we can get around this and I don't really want - and we're not getting around the law, but other things the regulators can do and I think that's why they're asking for the utilities to respond back to them in the next few weeks to decide what approach do we use. As Tom said, they resolved the - they ensured that the trackers - they supported trackers so there's ways you can track revenue. There's way you can track other things, which is fine. And I'm glad to see they endorsed that during the hearing so that'll be a published case, which means that, that should have a lot of substance in the future for how we actually go about looking at this.
So there are opportunities. We'll have to see what the Commission decides to do, what DTE decides to do and then we will certainly support what we can in that case."

For me to start giving you numbers that we've assumed is kind of self-defeating. So I won’t add much to that except to say that we try to self-implement the appropriate numbers so that there isn’t a large refund of any kind and just do the right thing there. But all the other assumptions you'd look at, we plan on normal weather, for example, and last year we were cooking. So there would be an upside if that were to happen again.
On the other hand, if it were a very mild summer, we'd have to take a hard look at what we’re doing. That would be a big challenge on top of this mild winter. So I would say look for normal things not extraordinary things. Normal weather, reasonable recovery in our rate cases and the like, as you look for the future numbers. We've tried not to be aggressive anywhere here.
One thing that John and I probably didn’t make really clear is that none of the recovery items we've shown you today cause us to do anything to the business that we think is unusual or make any sense. Sometimes you’ll hear us talk about if we got some upside we'll put some more money in tree trimming or even the other way around. We haven’t touched our forestry program. We haven’t touched our outage program, because we want all of those things to hold their own if we can. We've worked at the things that are all good business decisions.

257682,212286271,331546,"CMS Energy Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Glenn. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results an",929,"Thanks, Glenn. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as usual, we’ll close with Q&A.
Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.40 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Strong second quarter results give us the opportunity to reinvest back into the system to further improve reliability and customer service. Year-to-date results of $0.77 a share keeps us firmly on track to achieve our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
In June, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized us to increase our electric rates by $118 million and our gas rates by $16 million. A significant portion of the amount authorized reflects our investment in distribution and generation reliability, environmental compliance and technology.
We’ve experienced extremely hot weather in Michigan during the past two months. We set a record peak load for June and broke the all-time record on July 17, beating the previous mark by 2% set in July of 2011.
During this heat wave, our system performed very well and I’ll give you more details of that in a minute and later Tom will discuss the financial impacts from the weather and the recovery of the Michigan economy.
As you know, we settled the gas rate case for the second consecutive time. In part due to the relatively small size of the request. The larger electric rate case was approved at $118 million in line with the amount we self implemented. This case was primarily a recovery of investment costs representing 111% of the final order and lower operating cost, down $38 million from the prior order.
The Commission also adopted our sales forecast to reflect the 10% level of retail open access sales, up from 4% in prior rates. This adjustment increased our gross margin by $48 million. The commission approved a 10.3% ROE for both gas and electric.
Over the past few months, our system has been tested by the hot weather and it performed very well given the extreme conditions. On average, we have 10 days a year with temperatures of 90 degrees or warmer. So far this year, we’ve had 26 days with temperatures over 90 degrees and two days over 100 degrees. 10 of these days were in the second quarter, contributing $0.03 of earnings to the electric business.
For the second consecutive year, we set a new peak load record. This year’s peak load was over 9000 megawatts surpassing the previous mark set last year in July by 2%. The trend line shows that peak demand has grown by 200 megawatts since 2006.
Weather was a key factor as it was last year, but a growing economy also contributed. Weather adjusted sales are up 5% over the past three years led by industrial sales and are expected to grow about 1% annually over the next five years.
To meet the growing demand, we have invested over $640 million to increase capacity and improve reliability over the past five years and we plan to invest another 155 million this year. Continued investments are necessary to meet the future peak loads, I also anticipate the need for additional generation capacity in a few years from now due to the load growth and the environmental rules affecting our coal fleet.
Our system has performed, has improved significantly since 2006. Our peak load increased by 3% and a number of customer interruptions declined by 63%. On this year’s peak day, fewer than 1% of our customers had their service interrupted due to the heat and 99.9% of those customers had their power restored within eight hours. The investments we have made to harden this system and improve operations demonstrate their full value in times like these.
Changing gears, Michigan voters will likely face a lengthy ballot in November. Right now there are seven proposed constitutional amendments expected to be on the ballot. Among them is a proposal to require 25% of the state’s electricity to come from renewable sources by 2025. That proposal also would put a 1% cap on annual rate increases to pay for meeting that standard.
It would cost an estimated $12 billion for Michigan Utilities to meet the standard. A broad bipartisan coalition has been formed to oppose this reckless proposal. That coalition includes labor unions, utilities, businesses, elected officials and community leaders. Consumers Energy and the Utility Workers Union of America which represents about half of our employees are members of that coalition.
Many of you are aware of the Retail Open Access Legislation that was introduced in Michigan on March 21st to raise the cap. On June 13, the chairman of the House Energy and Technology Committee introduced legislation to return to full regulation. The chairman isn't planning on holding hearings planning on either bill.
The success of our business strategy depends on delivering reliable energy which provides value to our customers at an affordable price. A key to providing an affordable price is to continuously manage our cost. Over the past three yeas, we have restructured the business, improved safety, productivity and employee engagement while reducing the workforce by 7%. These improvements help us achieve our self-imposed restrictions to keep base rate at or below the rate of inflation for the next five years. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter.
"
257682,212286271,331546,"CMS Energy Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share,",1464,"Thank John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share, that's up $0.14 or as John mentioned 54% from last year. This included $0.03 for favorable warm weather in June.
Now please remember in the first quarter call, we noted that mild weather hurt us $0.13 a share. We identified recovery actions to fully offset the $0.13 hurt and it is all done. Our first half results are consequently are $0.77 and that's equal to last year. The improvement in this quarter compared with last year reflects planned rate improvements, cost reductions, the continuing economic rebound in our service territory and a better year to year favorable weather. 
Now here's a simple overview of the year so far. We hope you will find it’s a good illustration of our philosophy around meeting our commitments both to our customers and to you our investors. 
In the first quarter, earnings were pummeled by mild weather erasing $0.13 of EPS. We not only committed to recover it all we shared with you the line by line detail to do just that. Some of the recovery was non-utility and a good portion came from natural offsets like lower financing cost in the lower than expected interest rate environment and lower customer bad debts during the mild winter weather where we had lower customer usage. 
Recently, the hot summer including a bid in June and a lot so far in July provided $0.13 of good news. We have no plan to change any of the recovery actions and we are already reinvesting some of the good news to help our customers. 
We've increased tree trimming, we've pulled ahead some generation maintenance and we've accelerated hardening the system. We are looking at even more opportunities to improve this reliability as we go forward. Our customers will be better off and we will deliver our earnings growth commitment. 
There is a different view of the 2012 weather impact shown on the left, recovery actions to offset the poor weather in the first quarter and that's in the top right green box. And examples of reinvestments in reliability that are underway to use some of this hot summer weather today and that's in the bottom right box in yellow. 
If conditions provide further flexibility, we will add more customer investments. We are just kind of old fashioned about delivering our financial commitments and maximizing the benefits for our customers. So our full year earnings guidance remains unchanged at 5% to 7% growth or $1.52 to $1.55 a share. 
Now, this is our traditional waterfall update for the first half now behind us in the second half ahead. Winter weather was a big [hurt] that's dramatically offset this summer. For banking some of the cost savings associated with offsetting the unfavorable mild weather and we are reinvesting gains from the summer heat wave and customer reliability and that's good news for everybody. 
And the economy in Michigan continues its rebound at a pace that's a step or two faster than the US economy. We are bothered by national and global uncertainty but so far the recovery in Michigan continues fueled by constructive more supportive state policies and the sound 2008 energy law. 
So far in the first half, electric weather adjusted sales are up 3% and you can see that in the bottom right hand corner of this slide in a little gray area. Now that's 3% in our service territory. Also industrial sales are up 7.5% and that's on tough comps from strong performance last year. 
Residential sales are up 0.5 a point and commercial sales were up 1%. I know, I know our full year forecast is up 2%. I can hear you guys now. That's in spite of our actual experience of 3% so far this year. We plan conservatively. Further to understand the economy just a bit better if we exclude our energy efficiency work, it adds a full point to sales. 
So as you can see here, our sales growth of 5% over the last three years would be about 8% excluding energy efficiencies. And that gives you a clear picture of the economic growth compared to the past. 
Now looking a bit further out, it's clear that we will need more utility generation capacity especially if the economy continues to do better than expected in our service territory. If we’re not able to economically upgrade our small classic coal plants, we will need to meet growth requirements without that 950 megawatts of capacity.
Our renewable expansion in wind firms and Ludington pump storage plants will not be enough. Its clear gas generation will be the fuel of choice. Our options will include BBAs, purchasing assets and are building new capacity.
Our challenge is to address this need and all the other investment demands without pushing investments beyond our self composed limit that keeps our base customer rates below inflation. That’s a tall order. And the one we continue to balance.
Adding or dropping $500 million over the next five year period impact space rates around 40 to 50 basis points.
Now this of course depends on the benefits associated with that investment. The $6.6 billion of investment can be closer to six or maybe seven but we think at $6.5 billion it's about the right size.
Now if you can see on this slide, our plants keep electric and gas base rate increases shown in blue, well below inflation. Over the next five years, electric base rates are expected to be up about 1% and that’s a third level of the last few years. Gas base rates would be up less than 1% and that’s way lower than in the past.
Total electric rates however are up or expected to be up about 3% a year on average over the next five years. We’re working on reducing fuel cost to hold down total electric rates and you’ll hear a lot more about this in the future.
Total gas rates are expected to be down sharply over the next few years and about 2% on average over the next five years.
A sample of cost reductions to help keep rates down shown on the right box, we reduced the renewable surcharge by $57 million or 85% by negotiating attractive construction contracts and capturing tax benefits. 
As John mentioned, we have reduced headcount over the last three years by 7% and at the same time increased employee engagement by 4% to first quarter peer levels. We introduced sharing of healthcare costs to 70% company, 30% employees and that saves $30 million a year. 
Labor agreements provide for industry leading work practices more in line with what our customers expect. Productivity is up 35% over the last five years and we burned 97% less coals saving our customers $250 million a year. Please note, that these cost savings are designed carefully in a manner to avoid adversely impacting customer service or reliability. 
According to all of our (inaudible) and associates, our O&M costs of first quarter among peers and our overhead cost near top docile. We still believe that additional opportunities are abundant, our O&M costs are planned to be down about 4% in this year alone. 
Our liquidity remain strong and by design we keep a thicker level of liquidity than our peers with prefund parent debt maturities by a year or two in advance, and we sustain a robust backup plan because we keep a level of parent debt that’s just a bit higher than others. 
We deploy our CapEx in utility investments with an after-tax return above 10% instead of retiring more debt at a 3% return. We appreciate and deeply respect the positive outlook that the rating agencies maintain.
And here is our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. For the rest of this year, our profit and cash flow sensitivities are less risky than anywhere at the beginning of the year. 
This reflects having important rate cases behind us for the year and weather turning positively in our favor, not to mention the economic recovery that continues to out pace even our forecast. 
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business both operationally and cooperatively from a regulatory standpoint. We hope you find our performance unless you sleep at night and as always we thank you for joining us today and we thank you for your interest in the company. So John and I would be pleased now to take any of your questions.

Based on the litigation that occurred in the court ruling there have to be some kind of sales tracker, but even though we benefited from the weather this summer, obviously we are doing well this summer, we didn't benefit from the weather this winter because it was so warm.
So I think the type of business that we are, the consistency and the tracking of sales would be the right approach to do, but right now what we have is simply the tracking of the energy optimization.

However, the future really we think is dependent on natural gas generation; I think the fracking is the game changer; going forward we are building, just making clear we talked a little bit about is that we are building renewables now; we are upgrading Ludington pump storage. It’s important for us to keep a balance portfolio which is both, the coal, the renewable as well as the natural gas.

But we are pretty widespread, so we have furniture makers, we have food companies, we have pharmaceuticals, we have quite a widespread. What we are seeing is a layering in, so a lot of the metal benders, auto related and different people had a big rebound already, so you have seen our industrial sales up sharply and that’s why described to 7.5% against big tough comps.
Now what happens is there are other people who do better as you go to the recovery cycle. So furniture makers, they typically do better toward the end of the recovery when company start investing more and upgrading their furniture while we are seeing that. And then you have got folks that are in what I will call it solar panels and a lot of a new tech sort of things, we have a big customer in HSC, they are actually recovering kind of nicely and growing with that segment.
So we a nice spread, I think it’s the way you should about us; we are fortunate to have that and therefore as some companies layer in their growth that they didn’t come back as quickly on during the recovery we continue to see some nice uptick.

Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call.

Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as usual, we’ll close with Q&A.
Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.40 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Strong second quarter results give us the opportunity to reinvest back into the system to further improve reliability and customer service. Year-to-date results of $0.77 a share keeps us firmly on track to achieve our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
In June, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized us to increase our electric rates by $118 million and our gas rates by $16 million. A significant portion of the amount authorized reflects our investment in distribution and generation reliability, environmental compliance and technology.
We’ve experienced extremely hot weather in Michigan during the past 2 months. We set a record peak load for June and broke the all-time record on July 17, beating the previous mark by 2% set in July of 2011.
During this heat wave, our system performed very well and I’ll give you more details of that in a minute and later Tom will discuss the financial impacts from the weather and the recovery of the Michigan economy.
As you know, we settled the gas rate case for the second consecutive time. In part due to the relatively small size of the request. The larger electric rate case was approved at $118 million in line with the amount we self-implemented. This case was primarily a recovery of investment costs representing 111% of the final order and lower operating cost, down $38 million from the prior order.
The Commission also adopted our sales forecast to reflect the 10% level of retail open access sales, up from 4% in prior rates. This adjustment increased our gross margin by $48 million. The Commission approved a 10.3% ROE for both gas and electric.
Over the past few months, our system has been tested by the hot weather and it performed very well given the extreme conditions. On average, we have 10 days a year with temperatures of 90 degrees or warmer. So far this year, we’ve had 26 days with temperatures over 90 degrees and 2 days over 100 degrees. 10 of these days were in the second quarter, contributing $0.03 of earnings to the electric business.
For the second consecutive year, we set a new peak load record. This year’s peak load was over 9,000 megawatts surpassing the previous mark set last year in July by 2%. The trend line shows that peak demand has grown by 200 megawatts since 2006.
Weather was a key factor as it was last year, but a growing economy also contributed. Weather adjusted sales are up 5% over the past 3 years led by industrial sales and are expected to grow about 1% annually over the next 5 years.
To meet the growing demand, we have invested over $640 million to increase capacity and improve reliability over the past 5 years and we plan to invest another $155 million this year. Continued investments are necessary to meet the future peak loads, I also anticipate the need for additional generation capacity in a few years from now due to the load growth and the environmental rules affecting our coal fleet.
Our system has performed, has improved significantly since 2006. Our peak load increased by 3% and a number of customer interruptions declined by 63%. On this year’s peak day, fewer than 1% of our customers had their service interrupted due to the heat and 99.9% of those customers had their power restored within 8 hours. The investments we have made to harden this system and improve operations demonstrate their full value in times like these.
Changing gears, Michigan voters will likely face a lengthy ballot in November. Right now there are 7 proposed constitutional amendments expected to be on the ballot. Among them is a proposal to require 25% of the state’s electricity to come from renewable sources by 2025. That proposal also would put a 1% cap on annual rate increases to pay for meeting that standard.
It would cost an estimated $12 billion for Michigan Utilities to meet the standard. A broad bipartisan coalition has been formed to oppose this reckless proposal. That coalition includes labor unions, utilities, businesses, elected officials and community leaders. Consumers Energy and the Utility Workers Union of America which represents about half of our employees are members of that coalition.
Many of you are aware of the Retail Open Access Legislation that was introduced in Michigan on March 21 to raise the cap. On June 13, the chairman of the House Energy and Technology Committee introduced legislation to return to full regulation. The chairman isn't planning on holding hearings planning on either bill.
The success of our business strategy depends on delivering reliable energy which provides value to our customers at an affordable price. A key to providing an affordable price is to continuously manage our cost. Over the past 3 years, we have restructured the business, improved safety, productivity and employee engagement while reducing the workforce by 7%. These improvements help us achieve our self-imposed restrictions to keep base rate at or below the rate of inflation for the next 5 years. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter."
257682,212286271,334733,"CMS Energy Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share",1453,"Thanks, John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share, that's up $0.14 or as John mentioned 54% from last year. This included $0.03 for favorable warm weather in June.
Now please remember in the first quarter call, we noted that mild weather hurt us $0.13 a share. We identified recovery actions to fully offset the $0.13 hurt and it is all done. Our first half results are consequently are $0.77 and that's equal to last year. The improvement in this quarter compared with last year reflects planned rate improvements, cost reductions, the continuing economic rebound in our service territory and a better year-to-year favorable weather.
Now here's a simple overview of the year so far. We hope you will find it’s a good illustration of our philosophy around meeting our commitments both to our customers and to you our investors.
In the first quarter, earnings were pummeled by mild weather erasing $0.13 of EPS. We not only committed to recover it all we shared with you the line by line detail to do just that. Some of the recovery was non-utility and a good portion came from natural offsets like lower financing cost in the lower than expected interest rate environment and lower customer bad debts during the mild winter weather where we had lower customer usage.
Recently, the hot summer including a bid in June and a lot so far in July provided $0.13 of good news. We have no plan to change any of the recovery actions and we are already reinvesting some of the good news to help our customers.
We've increased tree trimming, we've pulled ahead some generation maintenance and we've accelerated hardening the system. We are looking at even more opportunities to improve this reliability as we go forward. Our customers will be better off and we will deliver our earnings growth commitment.
There is a different view of the 2012 weather impact shown on the left, recovery actions to offset the poor weather in the first quarter and that's in the top-right green box. And examples of reinvestments in reliability that are underway to use some of this hot summer weather today and that's in the bottom right box in yellow.
If conditions provide further flexibility, we will add more customer investments. We are just kind of old fashioned about delivering our financial commitments and maximizing the benefits for our customers. So our full year earnings guidance remains unchanged at 5% to 7% growth or $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
Now, this is our traditional waterfall update for the first half now behind us in the second half ahead. Winter weather was a big hurt, that's dramatically offset this summer. For banking some of the cost savings associated with offsetting the unfavorable mild weather and we are reinvesting gains from the summer heat wave and customer reliability and that's good news for everybody.
And the economy in Michigan continues its rebound at a pace that's a step or 2 faster than the U.S. economy. We are bothered by national and global uncertainty but so far the recovery in Michigan continues, fueled by constructive more supportive state policies and the sound 2008 energy law.
So far in the first half, electric weather adjusted sales are up 3% and you can see that in the bottom right-hand corner of this slide in a little gray area. Now that's 3% in our service territory. Also industrial sales are up 7.5% and that's on tough comps from strong performance last year.
Residential sales are up 0.5% and commercial sales were up 1%. I know, I know our full year forecast is up 2%. I can hear you guys now. That's in spite of our actual experience of 3% so far this year. We plan conservatively. Further to understand the economy just a bit better if we exclude our energy efficiency work, it adds 1% to sales.
So as you can see here, our sales growth of 5% over the last 3 years would be about 8% excluding energy efficiencies. And that gives you a clear picture of the economic growth compared to the past.
Now looking a bit further out, it's clear that we will need more utility generation capacity especially if the economy continues to do better than expected in our service territory. If we’re not able to economically upgrade our small classic coal plants, we will need to meet growth requirements without that 950 megawatts of capacity.
Our renewable expansion in wind firms and Ludington pump storage plants will not be enough. It's clear gas generation will be the fuel of choice. Our options will include BBAs, purchasing assets and are building new capacity.
Our challenge is to address this need and all the other investment demands without pushing investments beyond our self-imposed limit that keeps our base customer rates below inflation. That’s a tall order. And the one we continue to balance.
Adding or dropping $500 million over the next 5-year period impacts space rates around 40 to 50 basis points.
Now this of course depends on the benefits associated with that investment. The $6.6 billion of investment can be closer to $6 billion or maybe $7 billion but we think at $6.5 billion it's about the right size.
Now if you can see on this slide, our plants keep electric and gas base rate increases shown in blue, well below inflation. Over the next 5 years, electric base rates are expected to be up about 1% and that’s a third level of the last few years. Gas base rates would be up less than 1% and that’s way lower than in the past.
Total electric rates however are up or expected to be up about 3% a year on average over the next 5 years. We’re working on reducing fuel cost to hold down total electric rates and you’ll hear a lot more about this in the future.
Total gas rates are expected to be down sharply over the next few years and about 2% on average over the next 5 years.
A sample of cost reductions to help keep rates down shown on the right box. We reduced the renewable surcharge by $57 million or 85% by negotiating attractive construction contracts and capturing tax benefits.
As John mentioned, we have reduced headcount over the last 3 years by 7% and at the same time increased employee engagement by 4% to first quartile peer levels. We introduced sharing of health care costs to 70% company, 30% employees and that saves $30 million a year.
Labor agreements provide for industry-leading work practices more in line with what our customers expect. Productivity is up 35% over the last 5 years and we've burned 97% Western Coal saving our customers $250 million a year. Please note, that these cost savings are designed carefully in a manner to avoid adversely impacting customer service or reliability.
According to Oliver Wyman and associates, our O&M costs are first quartile among peers and our overhead cost near top decile. We still believe that additional opportunities are abundant, our O&M costs are planned to be down about 4% in this year alone.
Our liquidity remains strong and by design we keep a thicker level of liquidity than our peers with prefund parent debt maturities by 1 year or 2 in advance, and we sustain a robust backup plan because we keep a level of parent debt that’s just a bit higher than others.
We deploy our CapEx in utility investments with an after-tax return above 10% instead of retiring more debt at a 3% return. We appreciate and deeply respect the positive outlook that the rating agencies maintain.
And here is our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. For the rest of this year, our profit and cash flow sensitivities are less risky than anywhere at the beginning of the year.
This reflects having important rate cases behind us for the year and weather turning positively in our favor, not to mention the economic recovery that continues to outpace even our forecast.
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business both operationally and cooperatively from a regulatory standpoint. We hope you find our performance unless you sleep at night and as always we thank you for joining us today and we thank you for your interest in the company. So John and I would be pleased now to take any of your questions."

So I don’t that’s likely based on what I see the EPA doing in the near-term.
However, the future really we think is dependent on natural gas generation; I think the fracking is the game-changer; going forward we are building, just making clear we talked a little bit about is that we are building renewables now; we are upgrading Ludington pump storage. It’s important for us to keep a balance portfolio which is both, the coal, the renewable as well as the natural gas. But my expectation is to fill this void we’re going to have in the future it will be natural gas generation."

What he has talked about is energy infrastructure. Do we have the infrastructure moving forward to be able to grow with Michigan's economy.
And as Tom mentioned to you, we’re seeing the industrial sales continue to grow at a pretty rapid pace and maybe even don’t hurt us compared to all the utilities in the country. So he wants to have the growth here and the infrastructure in place to move forward and certainly with Michigan's unemployment, he would like to make sure that the jobs fall in line with that too; the job creation."

I expect that whatever we do in the future, we will continue to be balanced with coal, natural gas. We've got a long-term commitment for a nuclear plant, we've got renewable energy, we have pump storage and we have our energy efficiency programs that we are working on.

Now what happens is there are other people who do better as you go to the recovery cycle.

With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings press release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.
This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our forms 10-K and 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and information and risk factors section discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website.
CMS Energy provides financial results, both on a reported Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and adjusted, or non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years or other items. Certain of these items have the potential to impact favorably or unfavorably the company's reported earnings in 2012.
The company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters and is not providing reported earnings guidance.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to John."

Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results an",929,"Thanks, Glenn. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as usual, we’ll close with Q&A.
Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.40 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Strong second quarter results give us the opportunity to reinvest back into the system to further improve reliability and customer service. Year-to-date results of $0.77 a share keeps us firmly on track to achieve our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
In June, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized us to increase our electric rates by $118 million and our gas rates by $16 million. A significant portion of the amount authorized reflects our investment in distribution and generation reliability, environmental compliance and technology.
We’ve experienced extremely hot weather in Michigan during the past 2 months. We set a record peak load for June and broke the all-time record on July 17, beating the previous mark by 2% set in July of 2011.
During this heat wave, our system performed very well and I’ll give you more details of that in a minute and later Tom will discuss the financial impacts from the weather and the recovery of the Michigan economy.
As you know, we settled the gas rate case for the second consecutive time. In part due to the relatively small size of the request. The larger electric rate case was approved at $118 million in line with the amount we self-implemented. This case was primarily a recovery of investment costs representing 111% of the final order and lower operating cost, down $38 million from the prior order.
The Commission also adopted our sales forecast to reflect the 10% level of retail open access sales, up from 4% in prior rates. This adjustment increased our gross margin by $48 million. The Commission approved a 10.3% ROE for both gas and electric.
Over the past few months, our system has been tested by the hot weather and it performed very well given the extreme conditions. On average, we have 10 days a year with temperatures of 90 degrees or warmer. So far this year, we’ve had 26 days with temperatures over 90 degrees and 2 days over 100 degrees. 10 of these days were in the second quarter, contributing $0.03 of earnings to the electric business.
For the second consecutive year, we set a new peak load record. This year’s peak load was over 9,000 megawatts surpassing the previous mark set last year in July by 2%. The trend line shows that peak demand has grown by 200 megawatts since 2006.
Weather was a key factor as it was last year, but a growing economy also contributed. Weather adjusted sales are up 5% over the past 3 years led by industrial sales and are expected to grow about 1% annually over the next 5 years.
To meet the growing demand, we have invested over $640 million to increase capacity and improve reliability over the past 5 years and we plan to invest another $155 million this year. Continued investments are necessary to meet the future peak loads, I also anticipate the need for additional generation capacity in a few years from now due to the load growth and the environmental rules affecting our coal fleet.
Our system has performed, has improved significantly since 2006. Our peak load increased by 3% and a number of customer interruptions declined by 63%. On this year’s peak day, fewer than 1% of our customers had their service interrupted due to the heat and 99.9% of those customers had their power restored within 8 hours. The investments we have made to harden this system and improve operations demonstrate their full value in times like these.
Changing gears, Michigan voters will likely face a lengthy ballot in November. Right now there are 7 proposed constitutional amendments expected to be on the ballot. Among them is a proposal to require 25% of the state’s electricity to come from renewable sources by 2025. That proposal also would put a 1% cap on annual rate increases to pay for meeting that standard.
It would cost an estimated $12 billion for Michigan Utilities to meet the standard. A broad bipartisan coalition has been formed to oppose this reckless proposal. That coalition includes labor unions, utilities, businesses, elected officials and community leaders. Consumers Energy and the Utility Workers Union of America which represents about half of our employees are members of that coalition.
Many of you are aware of the Retail Open Access Legislation that was introduced in Michigan on March 21 to raise the cap. On June 13, the chairman of the House Energy and Technology Committee introduced legislation to return to full regulation. The chairman isn't planning on holding hearings planning on either bill.
The success of our business strategy depends on delivering reliable energy which provides value to our customers at an affordable price. A key to providing an affordable price is to continuously manage our cost. Over the past 3 years, we have restructured the business, improved safety, productivity and employee engagement while reducing the workforce by 7%. These improvements help us achieve our self-imposed restrictions to keep base rate at or below the rate of inflation for the next 5 years. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter."
257682,212286271,334744,"CMS Energy Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share",1453,"Thanks, John. We had a solid second quarter and we had good operating performance, constructive regulation and helpful weather. Excluding the upfront cost of our successful employee restructuring, adjusted earnings for the second quarter was $0.40 a share, that's up $0.14 or as John mentioned 54% from last year. This included $0.03 for favorable warm weather in June.
Now please remember in the first quarter call, we noted that mild weather hurt us $0.13 a share. We identified recovery actions to fully offset the $0.13 hurt and it is all done. Our first half results are consequently are $0.77 and that's equal to last year. The improvement in this quarter compared with last year reflects planned rate improvements, cost reductions, the continuing economic rebound in our service territory and a better year-to-year favorable weather.
Now here's a simple overview of the year so far. We hope you will find it’s a good illustration of our philosophy around meeting our commitments both to our customers and to you our investors.
In the first quarter, earnings were pummeled by mild weather erasing $0.13 of EPS. We not only committed to recover it all we shared with you the line by line detail to do just that. Some of the recovery was non-utility and a good portion came from natural offsets like lower financing cost in the lower than expected interest rate environment and lower customer bad debts during the mild winter weather where we had lower customer usage.
Recently, the hot summer including a bid in June and a lot so far in July provided $0.13 of good news. We have no plan to change any of the recovery actions and we are already reinvesting some of the good news to help our customers.
We've increased tree trimming, we've pulled ahead some generation maintenance and we've accelerated hardening the system. We are looking at even more opportunities to improve this reliability as we go forward. Our customers will be better off and we will deliver our earnings growth commitment.
There is a different view of the 2012 weather impact shown on the left, recovery actions to offset the poor weather in the first quarter and that's in the top-right green box. And examples of reinvestments in reliability that are underway to use some of this hot summer weather today and that's in the bottom right box in yellow.
If conditions provide further flexibility, we will add more customer investments. We are just kind of old fashioned about delivering our financial commitments and maximizing the benefits for our customers. So our full year earnings guidance remains unchanged at 5% to 7% growth or $1.52 to $1.55 a share.
Now, this is our traditional waterfall update for the first half now behind us in the second half ahead. Winter weather was a big hurt, that's dramatically offset this summer. For banking some of the cost savings associated with offsetting the unfavorable mild weather and we are reinvesting gains from the summer heat wave and customer reliability and that's good news for everybody.
And the economy in Michigan continues its rebound at a pace that's a step or 2 faster than the U.S. economy. We are bothered by national and global uncertainty but so far the recovery in Michigan continues, fueled by constructive more supportive state policies and the sound 2008 energy law.
So far in the first half, electric weather adjusted sales are up 3% and you can see that in the bottom right-hand corner of this slide in a little gray area. Now that's 3% in our service territory. Also industrial sales are up 7.5% and that's on tough comps from strong performance last year.
Residential sales are up 0.5% and commercial sales were up 1%. I know, I know our full year forecast is up 2%. I can hear you guys now. That's in spite of our actual experience of 3% so far this year. We plan conservatively. Further to understand the economy just a bit better if we exclude our energy efficiency work, it adds 1% to sales.
So as you can see here, our sales growth of 5% over the last 3 years would be about 8% excluding energy efficiencies. And that gives you a clear picture of the economic growth compared to the past.
Now looking a bit further out, it's clear that we will need more utility generation capacity especially if the economy continues to do better than expected in our service territory. If we’re not able to economically upgrade our small classic coal plants, we will need to meet growth requirements without that 950 megawatts of capacity.
Our renewable expansion in wind firms and Ludington pump storage plants will not be enough. It's clear gas generation will be the fuel of choice. Our options will include BBAs, purchasing assets and are building new capacity.
Our challenge is to address this need and all the other investment demands without pushing investments beyond our self-imposed limit that keeps our base customer rates below inflation. That’s a tall order. And the one we continue to balance.
Adding or dropping $500 million over the next 5-year period impacts space rates around 40 to 50 basis points.
Now this of course depends on the benefits associated with that investment. The $6.6 billion of investment can be closer to $6 billion or maybe $7 billion but we think at $6.5 billion it's about the right size.
Now if you can see on this slide, our plants keep electric and gas base rate increases shown in blue, well below inflation. Over the next 5 years, electric base rates are expected to be up about 1% and that’s a third level of the last few years. Gas base rates would be up less than 1% and that’s way lower than in the past.
Total electric rates however are up or expected to be up about 3% a year on average over the next 5 years. We’re working on reducing fuel cost to hold down total electric rates and you’ll hear a lot more about this in the future.
Total gas rates are expected to be down sharply over the next few years and about 2% on average over the next 5 years.
A sample of cost reductions to help keep rates down shown on the right box. We reduced the renewable surcharge by $57 million or 85% by negotiating attractive construction contracts and capturing tax benefits.
As John mentioned, we have reduced headcount over the last 3 years by 7% and at the same time increased employee engagement by 4% to first quartile peer levels. We introduced sharing of health care costs to 70% company, 30% employees and that saves $30 million a year.
Labor agreements provide for industry-leading work practices more in line with what our customers expect. Productivity is up 35% over the last 5 years and we've burned 97% Western Coal saving our customers $250 million a year. Please note, that these cost savings are designed carefully in a manner to avoid adversely impacting customer service or reliability.
According to Oliver Wyman and associates, our O&M costs are first quartile among peers and our overhead cost near top decile. We still believe that additional opportunities are abundant, our O&M costs are planned to be down about 4% in this year alone.
Our liquidity remains strong and by design we keep a thicker level of liquidity than our peers with prefund parent debt maturities by 1 year or 2 in advance, and we sustain a robust backup plan because we keep a level of parent debt that’s just a bit higher than others.
We deploy our CapEx in utility investments with an after-tax return above 10% instead of retiring more debt at a 3% return. We appreciate and deeply respect the positive outlook that the rating agencies maintain.
And here is our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. For the rest of this year, our profit and cash flow sensitivities are less risky than anywhere at the beginning of the year.
This reflects having important rate cases behind us for the year and weather turning positively in our favor, not to mention the economic recovery that continues to outpace even our forecast.
We are on target for all of our financial report card measures. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business both operationally and cooperatively from a regulatory standpoint. We hope you find our performance unless you sleep at night and as always we thank you for joining us today and we thank you for your interest in the company. So John and I would be pleased now to take any of your questions."

So I don’t that’s likely based on what I see the EPA doing in the near-term.
However, the future really we think is dependent on natural gas generation; I think the frac-ing is the game-changer; going forward we are building, just making clear we talked a little bit about is that we are building renewables now; we are upgrading Ludington pump storage. It’s important for us to keep a balance portfolio which is both, the coal, the renewable as well as the natural gas. But my expectation is to fill this void we’re going to have in the future it will be natural gas generation."

As you saw in the first quarter when times are tough we are going to do whatever it takes to do right things and not hurt our customers, but deliver the results and we have got a pretty long track record of doing that. But on the other hand when we get the good news and I know not everybody likes hearing this, but we get good news whether it’s weather or whatever it may be we are going to take that opportunity and invest more in our customers and it's just the right thing to do, it will give you a sustainable growth 5% to 7% on the earnings side and better serve customers and therefore happy customers make for a successful company. So we are very much driven that way and please don’t think of it like we are working the numbers, we are actually working the business. So when we talk about what we are doing now, we are doing more pole top maintenance. We are doing things that enhance the reliability with our transformers things that allow us to get work done sooner than we would otherwise have done and that’s good for everybody."

I expect that whatever we do in the future, we will continue to be balanced with coal, natural gas. We've got a long-term commitment for a nuclear plant, we've got renewable energy, we have pump storage and we have our energy efficiency programs that we are working on. But then for the near-term if you look at 5 or 7 years I think the generation that will be built in the state by anybody will be natural gas."

What we are seeing is a layering in, so a lot of the metal benders, auto-related and different people had a big rebound already, so you have seen our industrial sales up sharply and that’s why described to 7.5% against big tough comps. Now what happens is there are other people who do better as you go to the recovery cycle. So furniture makers, they typically do better toward the end of the recovery when company start investing more and upgrading their furniture while we are seeing that.

Thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year and then, as usual, close with Q&A.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54 a share, up a penny from last year. Year-to-date results of $1.31 a share, keeps us on track to achieve our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55. By rightsizing the business over the past three years, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of increased productivity and system efficiencies reducing the workforce by 7% in those years helps us keep our customer base rates at or below the rate of inflation for the next five years.
In September, we filed electric rate case seeking an increase of $148 million. Tom and I will detail some of the features of this case in a minute. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term capital investment plan. I will update you on a few of the major projects as well as our position on a ballot proposal that could result in significantly greater investments in renewable energy.
In just a few years, we see a capacity shortfall. In order to meet our peak load requirements, we will need to fill that shortfall. I will discuss a few of the options we are considering as well as the impact on our financial plan.
As mentioned, we filed a new electric rate case seeking $148 million in rate relief. 85% of the request is made up of capital investments. These investments enable us to deliver safe, reliable energy and keep our O&M cost down. As you can see on the right panel, we continue to bring capital driven cases to the commission. In the future we believe that annual rate cases may be avoided if there is an adjustment mechanism to recover projected investments.
We are also requesting a 10.5% return on equity, up from our current authorized level of 10.3%. Tom will discuss some of the specific mechanisms we have proposed to help streamline future rate cases.
Operationally, we continue to make good progress on our long-term capital investment plan. As you know, we have a disciplined plan which limits our investments to hold customer rates to an affordable price. The Ludington Pumped Storage Project is underway. All six units will be upgraded one at a time during an outage that starts in September and runs until May. The first urban upgrade will be completed in May 2014. When the last outage is completed in 2019, we will have increased the capacity by 300 megawatts and improved the operational efficiency and reliability.
At Lake Winds, we are on scheduled to begin commercial operation of this 101 megawatt wind park later this year, with all of the 56 turbines having been constructed and we are currently in the testing phase.
Our smart meter program is underway on the West side of the state. As we ramp up installations, we expect to have installed 250,000 meters by the end of next year.
Of course we are all aware of the upcoming November 6 elections. In Michigan, we are paying close attention to ballot Proposal 3 that we refer to 25x25. If passed, this proposal would require us to produce 25% of our power from renewables by the year 2025, up from the current requirement of 10% by 2015. You can see on the right panel the consequences of Proposal 3 passing.
Michigan would need at least 5,000 megawatts more wind capacity at a cost of about $12 billion. Michigan would be the only state in the country to pass a constitutional amendment mandating renewable energy. We believe this is the wrong way to implement a renewable energy policy. The 2008 Energy Law has provided constructive framework to implement energy policy including renewable energy standards.
As we look forward a few years, we anticipate a capacity shortfall with a drop of coal plants being retired due to the natural. With the probability that our classic seven coal plants will be mothballed in either 2015 or 2016 and MISO increasing its reserve capacity to potentially 18%, our shortfall could be as high as 1,500 megawatts.
Our renewable energy expansion in wind farms and at the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant will not be enough to close the gap. We will need to add more capacity and it appears that gas generation will be the fuel of choice. We will carefully evaluate all options including purchasing assets or building new capacity in Michigan. I expect we will need to make the decision in 2013.
We talk a lot about the flexibility of our investment plan. Our 2013 to 2017 plan calls for $6.5 billion of investments. With the capacity shortfall on the near horizon, this plan could easily be adjusted to accommodate a new gas generating plant. If we determine buying or building new gas generation is the most economic option for our customers our investment plan may grow by as much as $800 million. Even with this increase to the plan, average customer base rates would be held below 2%.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter.

This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.Ou",1384,"Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for this is our best performance in over 10 years. This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.
Our third-quarter reported results were $0.55 a share or $0.54 excluding a favorable legacy insurance claim. Adjusted earnings were up a $0.01 a share. The utility was up $0.03 with stronger sales and regulatory performance more than offsetting planned investments and accelerated reliability work. Enterprises and the parent were down $0.02 primarily reflecting the Michigan state tax benefit in 2011 not repeated this year.
Now here is a slide that’s become a bit more popular than we expected. It's an update of the version we showed to you in the first half of the year during our last earnings call. As you can see we have offset fully the adverse implications of the mild winter earlier this year. We also have put to use the earnings benefit of the hotter than normal summer by investing more in tree trimming, generating plant maintenance and system hardening.
We have a few more opportunities and are planning those with great care to ensure that our prospects for delivering earnings growth at 5% to 7% are not compromised, while at the same time we reinvest as much as we can for our customers. We don't want to overearn and we don't want to underearn our authorized ROE and we plan to deliver our earnings growth commitment while maximizing every opportunity to improve the conditions for our customers.
Our belief is pretty simple. When our customers win and when you win as investors, we are successful. So here is our performance, year-to-date.
This is the highest level in over 10 years and here is our forecast for the final three months of the year. Now if weather is normal and modest sales growth continues we should be right on target to deliver earnings in the $1.52 to the $1.55 range.
In today's uncertain world some of you ask us about Michigan and its economy. To provide a better perspective here is a comparison of a few economic indicators for the U.S., Michigan and our service territory. While U.S. unemployment peaked in the last recession at about 10% it has come down to around 8%. In Michigan unemployment peaked at 14% and we have seen substantial improvement but it's still high around 9%.
If you look at two major regions in the state, the Central and Western regions, which make up a big part of our service territory, you will see that unemployment reached about 11% and has since declined to about 6.5%. Over the last 12 months employment in these regions has improved by about 2.5% which compares with the overall U.S. growth at 2% and Michigan at 1%. We are fortunate to serve a portion of Michigan that’s economically more attractive than conditions in the state as a whole.
Continuing on with the economy, the Michigan economic index has improved substantially since the middle of 2009. Evidence of the rebound includes U.S. auto sales, up 15% from last year to about 15 million vehicle sales, non-farm payrolls up 46,000 or 1.2% and manufacturing jobs up more than 3% while Michigan has improved from 18 to 12 in the ranking of tax friendly states. We continue to see signs of further improvement although uncertainty has grown during this election cycle.
Here is another slide with which I think you become pretty familiar and it shows our electric sales, weather adjusted, over the last 35 years. Recall that the worst recession we have ever seen was in the early 1980s but the recovery from the most recent recession has been slower. In fact, as we stick with our cautionary approach to forecasting sales, we have lowered our outlook for 2012 to 1.3%.
Now that’s the same as last year's growth. For the first nine months, sales were actually up 2%. Excluding energy efficiency work, the underlying economic growth was about 3% and we forecast about 2.5% for the year. That's about the same growth as over the last two years.
Now let's get back to the net numbers. The net sales improvement forecast at 1.3% for the year includes year-to-date growth of 2%. This continues to be driven by industrial sales growth of 5.7% on top of 3.6% last year and 10% two years ago. Residential and commercial sales lag. They remain flat.
The primary reason we have lowered the growth rate a bit is because industrial customers that rely heavily on products supplying the renewable energy sector have seen a slowing in their growth rates. These are customers that generate little margin for us because they are provided with special rates. Unfortunately we can't share more detail with you but suffice it to say their impact on our profit is minimal.
On a related subject, most of you are aware that we no longer have decoupling for our electric business following an appeals court decision addressing another utility. Because the appeals court judge was clear that tracker like mechanisms are permitted we have requested a revenue adjustment mechanism in our recently filed electric rate case. For the gas business decoupling is still permitted and while we suspended its use temporarily with the most recent gas rates settlement we plan to request continuation in the future.
Now John covered the newly filed electric rate case just a few moments ago. I thought I would discuss some of our proposed process improvements that are reflected in that case. Most of you are familiar with the 2008 Michigan Energy Law that provides for more timely rate making, limited competition, energy optimization and renewable generation.
In our new electric rate case, we have proposed some additional steps to make the process even more efficient and effective. These include a revenue adjustment mechanism consistent with the appeals court decoupling ruling. These also include potential adjustment mechanisms for pension and retiree healthcare as well as uncollectible accounts.
For example, if we are able to make expected progress with uncollectible accounts, this mechanism will permit us to share the benefit with our customers quicker than waiting for another rate case. In addition, we propose a two-year capital investment recovery mechanism, also to provide more efficiency. Should the commission choose to support this mechanism then it's not likely that we will need to request another rate case for two years.
As you know, the bulk of our rate cases are about capital recovery and returning improved levels of O&M to our customers. The capital investment portion of this request is 85% of total. There are other features designed to improve reliability for our customers. For example, we are requesting the resources to shorten our tree trimming cycle from about 14 years to around eight years and that's all good news for our customers. All in all, this rate case is intended to minimize customer volatility and provide more certainty to you as investors.
Talking about stability and certainty, here is the latest look at our liquidity. At mid-year, we were at 32% of market cap, almost twice the level of our peers. S&P and Moody's outlooks for both the parent and the utility are positive and we are grateful for this vote of confidence and the improvement we have made to our cash flow metrics and to our balance sheet.
Here is our traditional cash flow forecast for both the parent and the utility. As you can see, most of the financing is complete and the plants continue on a strong track. This is our earnings and cash flow sensitivity updated for the latest conditions. You can use this tool for assessing both 2012 and 2013 conditions
So we are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for this year and for next. John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we will present on Tuesday, November 13 at 8:15 Mountain Time, 8:15 AM, that is.
We would be pleased now to take your questions. So, operator, would you be kind enough to open the line for those questions. Thank you.

Obviously you went a slightly different route than DTE has with the commission and I am wondering if maybe you could give a little bit of detail around how your revenue mechanism might work?
Then secondly, you mentioned that the capital recovery mechanism would be the main driver of whether or not you are going to be a regular filer. Is that kind of a black-and-white situation? If you don't get the CapEx adjustment but everything else, might that still help you stay up?

Let me just give you a brief background first. We are in the situation where most of our request of the Public Service Commission is all around capital investment. So as John showed you in one of the earlie",801,"Thanks for those questions. Those are good ones. Let me just give you a brief background first. We are in the situation where most of our request of the Public Service Commission is all around capital investment. So as John showed you in one of the earlier slides, which you can go back and look at, in our last three rate cases as well as this one that we are provided for now, the bulk again is capital investment.
So to take your second question first, if we had some form of, I will call it a tracker, but it is more like a revenue adjustment mechanism, that permitted us just to have a plan in place where we would have the normal year covered as we wouldn't have rate case and then the next test year also covered and then there would be a good opportunity for the commission and its staff to audit just like it does on pass-throughs at GCRs, and PSCRs the fact that we followed exactly the plan and any changes that were made to the plan would be accommodated in the audit process later. If we were able to do all of that then there would be no need to come in for a rate case.
Basically what we do is we are typically holding our O&M flat to down a little bit and that's the other reason that you might need a rate case, where if we are in that zone of flat to down the only disappointment is our desire to continue to give our customers more rate relief by passing that O&M through to them. So we are looking at a two year trial. Some people have suggested that maybe a three-year approach would be better. So we wouldn't have to come in for rate cases for three years.
But our view is, let's take it easy. First step, let's do two years. If the commission supports that approach, then yes. We don’t see a need to come back on the electric side for a couple years for another rate case and if they support that we would consider that in our gas business as well and look for an opportunity that might permit us to stay out of rate cases there may be for two or three years.
Mark, don't think of it like freeze. That's not what we are trying to do here. We are just trying to be more efficient and more effective with the rate making process and make it easier for everybody who has to administer it but take no exceptions to doing it with excellence and perfection and I think most people would agree that it's probably nice to avoid the detail of a rate case if you got a simple plan on your capital investment. So yes, it is a little bit of an on-off switch and I think that's a fair comparison.
If we get the support from the commission, we probably won't be back for a couple years. If they would like to us in each year for those capital requests, we would be happy to do that as well.
Now your second question on the revenue mechanism. Do think of it as just a way for us to put something new and different in place now that we don't have electric decoupling. We have it for gas but not for electric. Though since the commission has full authority over tracking type mechanisms, we are asking for this revenue adjustment which would, it's a very simple, the math looks complicated but it's really a simple request. It just says whatever is in our rate case, if the sales are better, whether it's for energy efficiency or whether it's for the economy or whether it's for the weather. Whatever might happen there, then we would share that good news back with our customers. Good for them, good for us and good for you.
If it's the other way and it goes down, same thing. We would share that. So it provides more stability and cost in rates that our customers see and more stability for you as investors. It's really that's straight forward.
Now, when the commission goes through it, I am sure they are going to be thinking carefully about what they would like to do and they have some obvious choices on whether they are going to include weather or the economy or energy efficiency. We are certain though we would look favorably on energy efficiency since they have been strong supporters of what's in the Energy Law on that subject but there will be choices for them and we will share our thoughts and then they will make the final decision and we will be happy with whatever they conclude. Thanks

Couple of things that you should note. Every newspaper that has done an editorial in Michigan so far has been opposed to Proposal 3 and that will influence voters. Particularly those that are undecided. We think we have got most of the momentum in our favor but there is a lot of undecided voters with a lot of ballot initiatives on the ballot this year.

On the electric side of the business, quarter ago we wrote off the decoupling business. So just, you get a nice pure look at that. Just think of what we have in there, its weather or economy, it's just good and bad. So the big picture on that is, it was really warm in the summer and you see that flowing through all the numbers that we gave you.
Now on the gas side of the business, a little bit different, because we had decoupling in place. When we got to our settlement we agreed to suspend it until the next case. So you are going to get decoupling for the prior year in your gas numbers and then you won't have it when you come to the new years. Also remember, on the gas side, we never had decoupling for weather. We had for the economy and for energy efficiency. So this mild weather that we had in the first quarter of the year, even early in the spring, all that flows through.
So when you look at something like slide number 12 and you see $0.13 of bad news it says around March 31 but that's really dipping into April just a little bit. That’s primarily the weather flow through on the gas side. Then you look at the hot summer there's a lot of ups and downs in there but in the red part through July 23, $0.13 that's really most of that good news of hot weather. If that helps you, I will stop there but we can go further if you would like.

We have a great deal of respect, as do many, for the rating agencies and we spend a lot of time trying to give them a look for five plus years out on what the business looks like and any time there's anything happening we give them detail on those five years to keep them up to speed. We put absolutely no pressure on them regarding ratings and I know you don't want to hear that others don't like to hear that but here's why.
It's our view, as they do a good job and make they will make the call when they think it's appropriate to make the call. Consequently we are very happy that both S&P and Moody's do have the parent and utility on a positive outlook. We are grateful for that but we are not pushing them to make a change. We just want them to see the data and do the right thing.
One little pieces of logic is this simple. I would rather have them make an upgrade when they believe they are comfortable with it so that their look is or at least 50-50 in the future then have you is investors be concerned that the rating that we have has little more downside than it does upside. I would rather be the other way.
So, as a board and as a management team, we are very focused on having a strong healthy balance sheet that supports the business today and going forward and we are hopeful that the rating agencies will take a view that that merits having a credit rating that's more positive than it is today but they will get there when they do.
So our job is to run the business well and improve it every day and their job is to assess it and share that with you and I think they have sent you a signal and I have no predictions to offer as to what they might do and when they would do that but obviously they will do that on their own. Hope that color helps you a little bit because we do view it as an important subject.

So we make sure that our customer rates don't go higher than the level of inflation.
That's driver number one and therefore you would have a sustainable growth plan that goes for years and years. So the first choice is, do we do it or not? The second choice is, can we create some offsets and if we can there may be no need to do anything different on our equity plan. But the third piece is if it turns out we can put all of this in and go to $7.3 billion and we know we can keep our rates below inflation doing that then we might possibly look at equity.

We are way far away from that. We don't see the need to change our description to you that there's no need to issue equity other than the continuous equity program we have over the next several years.
So we are probably in good shape. If however we decided that it would be good to issue equity to support this it certainly wouldn't be this year and it wouldn't be next year and then the question is would it be needed in '14 or '15. Uncertain.
So we are still sending the message that we don't need equity. We will be managing the numbers as we go through to see if we can maintain that but if the growth is going to be that much faster and that much bigger we are not bashful about coming to you with a good business proposition.

As that market gets richer on the energy prices and capacity prices there will be opportunities to lock-in contracts there that would be more profitable than what we might do today.
So we are running along with the market at a pretty low level of results and I think you should anticipate that that’s something that will improve as we go through time. Again, put it in context, it's 5% of our business. Maybe it will grow a little bit more than that as we go in the future but it's not the core of our business. Our utility is the bulk and will always remain the bulk of our business.

That process would take, I think, legislatively nine months is required.
So to put it in scope that's what it looks like. So if we had a no-go decision it would be well into 2013, if not early in '14, and part of it really is dependent, I think, one of the other people asked the question too, what are the environmental rules going to be?
And as Tom talked about our CapEx spend, a lot of our capital expenditures are based on environmental controls for our plants. If things were accelerated, changed, delayed, that may also, or if new technology develops, it may enable us to use different forms of technology to reach the same outcome. So that will allow us to readjust our capital base.
But the timing wise I give you that time. End of the year, we would pretty much have an idea. Early next year, we would have an idea, specifically that we would be able to move forward with. Because I think that’s the timing. If it is a gas plant, we are going to need about three years to get through that process.

So from an investor standpoint, it actually is an investment opportunity both renewable energy and backup for capacity.

We brought our numbers down a little bit from the last quarter when we showed you this but what I want to do is offer again what we are seeing so far actually. Because it's kind of like gas prices and things like that, it's the actuals that are the solid numbers and our guesses are just that. Therefore we try to be conservative. They are not shown on the slide. I did mention them but I want to repeat them.
For the first nine months of the year the growth compared to the first nine months of the year ago was flat on residential and flat on commercial. So we are staying conservative there. The industrial side was actually up 5.7% for an overall growth of just about 2%. That's what we are looking at. But we said, there seems to be some uncertainty in this election period and that makes us want to be conservative.
Then there is another event going on that unfortunately we can't talk a lot about but I mentioned that some of our renewable type of customers are struggling in this political environment that's going on. So their numbers, we think should be a bit lower. I can't say much more than that. We tried to factor that into our fourth quarter. They get special contracts. So there is not profit margin to speak of there but we brought that number down to 1.3% in total which is about where we were last year for growth and not that far off where we were for 2010.
We are going to give you more in 2013 when we get out to our guidance early in the year and maybe we will talk about it more as we get to the end of the year but we felt for the rest of this year, we just want to be conservative. We don't want to plan for something that's better than it turns out and if it turns out better, great. Usually that's a help in one way or another.
So those are the facts about the nine months and that's the guidance for the year. So even though the first nine months are up about 2%, we are saying that for the full year we should be about 1.3%, the industrial will still be pretty good in that, and we still think residential and commercial will be following, as people's confidence grow and the economy continues to grow. Does that help you enough for now?

We are well on our way to achieve those targets. We have made the investments at Lake Winds. We are working on Cross Winds, the other major utilities in Michigan are doing the same thing.
So we were moving towards that end. Your point about, is there more political demand for renewable energy, I think was a good way to state it. I think there's certain people that have a political view that want more renewable energy than others. I will tell you, our view here at the company, my view personally, I like renewable energy. We support it. But I want to balance portfolio.
It is more expensive for our customers, renewable energy is more expensive particularly compared to baseload with gas today. It's an intermittent resources and with our first wind park that we just built we find that people like to have renewable energy until you actually locate it. Then it becomes a little bit more of a challenge when you start getting into sighting and zoning and some of the issues that we run into and if you are familiar with Michigan we are basically a peninsula and to hit the targets that would be required by 25x25, it's likely we would have to go offshore with wind, which is another issue that becomes a huge political issue and a local zoning issue too.

Thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year, and then, as usual, we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54 a share, up a penny from last year. Year-to-date results of $1.31 a share, keeps us on track to achieve our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55. By rightsizing the business over the past 3 years, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of increased productivity and system efficiencies. Reducing the workforce by 7% in those years helps us keep our customer base rates at or below the rate of inflation for the next 5 years.
In September, we filed electric rate case seeking an increase of $148 million. Tom and I will detail some of the features of this case in a minute. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term capital investment plan. I will update you on a few of the major projects, as well as our position on a ballot proposal that could result in significantly greater investments in renewable energy.
In just a few years, we see a capacity shortfall. In order to meet our peak load requirements, we will need to fill that shortfall. I will discuss a few of the options we are considering as well as the impact on our financial plan.
As mentioned, we filed a new electric rate case seeking $148 million in rate relief. 85% of the request is made up of capital investments. These investments enable us to deliver safe, reliable energy and keep our O&M costs down. As you can see on the right panel, we continue to bring capital-driven cases to the commission. In the future we believe that annual rate cases may be avoided if there is an adjustment mechanism to recover projected investments.
We are also requesting a 10.5% return on equity, up from our current authorized level of 10.3%. Tom will discuss some of the specific mechanisms we have proposed to help streamline future rate cases.
Operationally, we continue to make good progress on our long-term capital investment plan. As you know, we have a disciplined plan which limits our investments to hold customer rates to an affordable price. The Ludington Pumped Storage Project is underway. All 6 units will be upgraded one at a time during an outage that starts in September and runs until May. The first urban upgrade will be completed in May 2014. When the last outage is completed in 2019, we will have increased the capacity by 300 megawatts and improved the operational efficiency and reliability.
At Lake Winds, we are on schedule to begin commercial operation of this 101 megawatt wind park later this year, with all of the 56 turbines having been constructed and we are currently in the testing phase.
In our smart reader program-- our smart meter program is underway on the West side of the state. As we ramp up installations, we expect to have installed 250,000 meters by the end of next year.
Of course we are all aware of the upcoming November 6 elections. In Michigan, we are paying close attention to ballot Proposal 3, that we refer to as 25x25. If passed, this proposal would require us to produce 25% of our power from renewables by the year 2025, up from the current requirement of 10% by 2015. You can see on the right panel the consequences of Proposal 3 passing.
Michigan would need at least 5,000 megawatts more of wind capacity at a cost of about $12 billion. Michigan would be the only state in the country to pass a constitutional amendment mandating renewable energy. We believe this is the wrong way to implement a renewable energy policy. The 2008 Energy Law has provided a constructive framework to implement energy policy including renewable energy standards.
As we look forward a few years, we anticipate a capacity shortfall with a drop of coal plants being retired due to natural  oil. With the probability that our classic seven coal plants will be mothballed in either 2015 or 2016 and MISO increasing its reserve capacity to potentially 18%, our shortfall could be as high as 1,500 megawatts.
Our renewable energy expansion in wind farms and at the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant will not be enough to close the gap. We will need to add more capacity and it appears that gas generation will be the fuel of choice. We will carefully evaluate all options including purchasing assets or building new capacity in Michigan. I expect we will need to make the decision in 2013.
We talk a lot about the flexibility of our investment plan. Our 2013 to 2017 plan calls for $6.5 billion of investments. With the capacity shortfall on the near horizon, this plan could easily be adjusted to accommodate a new gas-generating plant. If we determine buying or building new gas generation is the most economic option for our customers our investment plan may grow by as much as $800 million. Even with this increase to the plan, average customer base rates would be held below 2%.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter."

This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell, it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.",1381,"Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today, for this is our best performance in over 10 years. This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell, it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.
Our third-quarter reported results were $0.55 a share or $0.54, excluding a favorable legacy insurance claim. Adjusted earnings were up a $0.01 a share. The utility was up $0.03 with stronger sales and regulatory performance more than offsetting planned investments and accelerated reliability work. Enterprises and the parent were down $0.02 primarily reflecting the Michigan state tax benefit in 2011 not repeated this year.
Now here is a slide that’s become a bit more popular than we expected. It's an update of the version we showed to you in the first half of the year during our last earnings call. As you can see, we have offset fully the adverse implications of the mild winter earlier this year. We also have put to use the earnings benefit of the hotter-than-normal summer by investing more in tree trimming, generating plant maintenance and system hardening.
We have a few more opportunities and are planning those with great care to ensure that our prospects for delivering earnings growth at 5% to 7% are not compromised, while at the same time we reinvest as much as we can for our customers. We don't want to overearn and we don't want to underearn our authorized ROE and we plan to deliver our earnings growth commitment while maximizing every opportunity to improve the conditions for our customers.
Our belief is pretty simple. When our customers win and when you win as investors, we are successful. So here is our performance, year-to-date.
This is the highest level in over 10 years, and here is our forecast for the final 3 months of the year. Now if weather is normal and modest sales growth continues we should be right on target to deliver earnings in the $1.52 to the $1.55 range.
In today's uncertain world, some of you ask us about Michigan and its economy. To provide a better perspective here is a comparison of a few economic indicators for the U.S., Michigan and our service territory. While U.S. unemployment peaked in the last recession at about 10%, it has come down to around 8%. In Michigan, unemployment peaked at 14% and we have seen substantial improvement, but it's still high-- around 9%.
If you look at two major regions in the state, the Central and Western regions, which make up a big part of our service territory, you will see that unemployment reached about 11% and has since declined to about 6.5%. Over the last 12 months employment in these regions has improved by about 2.5% which compares with the overall U.S. growth at 2% and Michigan at 1%. We are fortunate to serve a portion of Michigan that’s economically more attractive than conditions in the state as a whole.
Continuing on with the economy, the Michigan economic index has improved substantially since the middle of 2009. Evidence of the rebound includes U.S. auto sales, up 15% from last year to about 15 million vehicle sales, non-farm payrolls up 46,000 or 1.2% and manufacturing jobs up more than 3%, while Michigan has improved from 18 to 12 in the ranking of tax friendly states. We continue to see signs of further improvement, although uncertainty has grown during this election cycle.
Here is another slide with which I think you have become pretty familiar with, and it shows our electric sales, weather adjusted, over the last 35 years. Recall that the worst recession we have ever seen was in the early 1980s but the recovery from the most recent recession has been slower. In fact, as we stick with our cautionary approach to forecasting sales, we have lowered our outlook for 2012 to 1.3%.
Now that’s the same as last year's growth. For the first 9 months, sales were actually up 2%. Excluding energy efficiency work, the underlying economic growth was about 3% and we forecast about 2.5% for the year. That's about the same growth as over the last two years.
Now let's get back to the net numbers. The net sales improvement forecast at 1.3% for the year includes year-to-date growth of 2%. This continues to be driven by industrial sales growth of 5.7% on top of 3.6% last year and 10% 2 years ago. Residential and commercial sales lag. They remain flat.
The primary reason we have lowered the growth rate a bit is because industrial customers that rely heavily on products supplying the renewable energy sector have seen a slowing in their growth rates. These are customers that generate little margin for us because they are provided with special rates. Unfortunately we can't share more detail with you, but suffice it to say, their impact on our profit is minimal.
On a related subject, most of you are aware that we no longer have decoupling for our electric business following an appeals court decision addressing another utility. Because the appeals court judge was clear that tracker-like mechanisms are permitted, we have requested a revenue adjustment mechanism in our recently filed electric rate case. For the gas business, decoupling is still permitted and while we suspended its use temporarily with the most recent gas rates settlement we plan to request continuation in the future.
Now, John covered the newly filed electric rate case just a few moments ago. I thought I would discuss some of our proposed process improvements that are reflected in that case. Most of you are familiar with the 2008 Michigan Energy Law that provides for more timely rate making, limited competition, energy optimization and renewable generation.
In our new electric rate case, we have proposed some additional steps to make the process even more efficient and effective. These include a revenue adjustment mechanism consistent with the appeals court decoupling ruling. These also include potential adjustment mechanisms for pension and retiree healthcare, as well as uncollectible accounts.
For example, if we are able to make expected progress with uncollectible accounts, this mechanism will permit us to share the benefit with our customers quicker than waiting for another rate case. In addition, we propose a 2-year capital investment recovery mechanism, also to provide more efficiency. Should the commission choose to support this mechanism, then it's not likely that we will need to request another rate case for 2 years.
As you know, the bulk of our rate cases are about capital recovery and returning improved levels of O&M to our customers. The capital investment portion of this request is 85% of total. There are other features designed to improve reliability for our customers. For example, we are requesting the resources to shorten our tree trimming cycle from about 14 years to around 8 years, and that's all good news for our customers. All in all, this rate case is intended to minimize customer volatility and provide more certainty to you as investors.
Talking about stability and certainty, here is the latest look at our liquidity. At mid-year, we were at 32% of market cap, almost twice the level of our peers. S&P and Moody's outlooks for both the parent and the utility are positive, and we are grateful for this vote of confidence and the improvement we have made to our cash flow metrics and to our balance sheet.
Here is our traditional cash flow forecast for both the parent and the utility. As you can see, most of the financing is complete and the plans continue on a strong track. This is our earnings and cash flow sensitivity updated for the latest conditions. You can use this tool for assessing both 2012 and 2013 conditions
So we are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets, as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for this year and for next. John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we will present on Tuesday, November 13 at 8:15 Mountain Time-- 8:15 AM, that is.

Obviously, you went a slightly different route than DTE has with the commission, and I am wondering if maybe you could give a little bit of detail around how your revenue mechanism might work?
Then secondly, you mentioned that the capital recovery mechanism would be the main driver of whether or not you are going to be a regular filer. Is that kind of a black-and-white situation? If you don't get the CapEx adjustment but everything else, might that still help you stay up?"

Let me just give you a brief background first. We are in the situation where most of our request of the Public Service Commission is all around capital investment. So as John showed you in one of the earlie",799,"Thanks for those questions. Those are good ones. Let me just give you a brief background first. We are in the situation where most of our request of the Public Service Commission is all around capital investment. So as John showed you in one of the earlier slides, which you can go back and look at, in our last 3 rate cases, as well as this one that we are provided for now, the bulk again is capital investment.
So to take your second question first, if we had some form of, I will call it a tracker, but it is more like a revenue adjustment mechanism, that permitted us just to have a plan in place where we would have the normal year covered as we wouldn't have in the rate case, and then the next test year also covered and then there would be a good opportunity for the commission and its staff to audit just like it does on pass-throughs at GCRs, and PSCRs the fact that we followed exactly the plan and any changes that were made to the plan would be accommodated in the audit process later. If we were able to do all of that, then there would be no need to come in for a rate case.
Basically what we do is we are typically holding our O&M flat to down a little bit and that's the other reason that you might need a rate case, where if we are in that zone of flat to down, the only disappointment is our desire to continue to give our customers more rate relief by passing that O&M through to them. So we are looking at a 2-year trial. Some people have suggested that maybe a 3-year approach would be better. So we wouldn't have to come in for rate cases for 3 years.
But our view is, let's take it easy. First step, let's do 2 years. If the commission supports that approach, then yes. We don’t see a need to come back on the electric side for a couple years for another rate case and if they support that we would consider that in our gas business as well and look for an opportunity that might permit us to stay out of rate cases there may be for 2 or 3 years.
Mark, don't think of it like freeze. That's not what we are trying to do here. We are just trying to be more efficient and more effective with the rate-making process and make it easier for everybody who has to administer it but take no exceptions to doing it with excellence and perfection, and I think most people would agree that it's probably nice to avoid the detail of a rate case if you've got a simple plan on your capital investment. So yes, it is a little bit of an on-off switch, and I think that's a fair comparison.
If we get the support from the commission, we probably won't be back for a couple years. If they would like to us in each year for those capital requests, we would be happy to do that as well.
Now your second question on the revenue mechanism. Do think of it as just a way for us to put something new and different in place now that we don't have electric decoupling. We have it for gas, but not for electric. Though since the commission has full authority over tracking type mechanisms, we are asking for this revenue adjustment-which would, it's a very simple-- the math looks complicated but it's really a simple request. It just says whatever is in our rate case, if the sales are better, whether it's for energy efficiency or whether it's for the economy or whether it's for the weather. Whatever might happen there, then we would share that good news back with our customers. Good for them, good for us and good for you.
If it's the other way and it goes down, same thing. We would share that. So it provides more stability and cost in rates that our customers see, and more stability for you as investors. It's really that's straightforward.
Now, when the commission goes through it, I am sure they are going to be thinking carefully about what they would like to do, and they have some obvious choices on whether they are going to include weather, or the economy, or energy efficiency. We are certain though we would look favorably on energy efficiency since they have been strong supporters of what's in the Energy Law on that subject but there will be choices for them and we will share our thoughts and then they will make the final decision and we will be happy with whatever they conclude.

On the electric side of the business, quarter ago we wrote off the decoupling business. So just-- you get a nice pure look at that. Just think of what we have in there, its weather or economy, it's just good and bad. So the big picture on that is, it was really warm in the summer and you see that flowing through all the numbers that we gave you.
Now on the gas side of the business, a little bit different, because we had decoupling in place. When we got to our settlement we agreed to suspend it until the next case. So you are going to get decoupling for the prior year in your gas numbers and then you won't have it when you come to the new years. Also remember, on the gas side, we never had decoupling for weather. We had it for the economy and for energy efficiency. So this mild weather that we had in the first quarter of the year, even early in the spring, all that flows through.
So when you look at something like Slide # 12 and you see $0.13 of bad news, it says around March 31 but that's really dipping into April just a little bit. That’s primarily the weather flow through on the gas side. Then you look at the hot summer there's a lot of ups and downs in there but in the red part through July 23, $0.13 that's really most of that good news of hot weather. If that helps you, I will stop there, but we can go further if you would like."

You will have job when you need it. Just kidding. Let me just remind, because I think most everyone on the call has heard us say this, John and I, before, and I want to remind you of our approach.
We have a great deal of respect, as do many, for the rating agencies and we spend a lot of time trying to give them a look for 5-plus years out on what the business looks like and any time there's anything happening we give them detail on those 5 years to keep them up to speed. We put absolutely no pressure on them regarding ratings and I know you don't want to hear that others don't like to hear that but here's why.
It's our view, as they do a good job and make they will make the call when they think it's appropriate to make the call. Consequently, we are very happy that both S&P and Moody's do have the parent and utility on a positive outlook. We are grateful for that, but we are not pushing them to make a change. We just want them to see the data and do the right thing.
One little pieces of logic is this simple. I would rather have them make an upgrade when they believe they are comfortable with it, so that their look is or at least 50-50 in the future, then have you as investors be concerned that the rating that we have has little more downside than it does upside. I would rather be the other way.
So, as a board and as a management team, we are very focused on having a strong healthy balance sheet that supports the business today and going forward and we are hopeful that the rating agencies will take a view that that merits having a credit rating that's more positive than it is today, but they will get there when they do.
So our job is to run the business well and improve it every day, and their job is to assess it and share that with you and I think they have sent you a signal and I have no predictions to offer as to what they might do and when they would do that; obviously they will do that on their own. Hope that color helps you a little bit because we do view it as an important subject."

Once we do that, yes, then you can think for your modeling that you could at $800 million into the rate base from that standpoint. That’s what we think a unit of the optimal size will be, but what I want to make sure and clear and set the tone for everyone, we are still evaluating this right now.
This is more of a heads up for you. We have room to do it. It will affect the plan somewhat but it is certainly something that we can afford but we need to make sure that we do have the plan in place to know that is the right choice. It changes our balance of the portfolio a little bit in our fleet but based on natural gas prices going forward, I think that is the right thing to do, which keeps us well-balanced, but a little heavier on natural gas than we are today.

I would just preface the discussion on equity with, just add to what john just said that the range of spending he just showed you in the little bubble, $6.5 billion to $7.3 billion, is a range because we may be able to offset some of that with other things we would do differently in order to constantly focused on how to keep that number around $7 billion so we make sure that our customer rates don't go higher than the level of inflation.
That's driver number one and therefore you would have a sustainable growth plan that goes for years and years. So the first choice is, do we do it or not? The second choice is, can we create some offsets, and if we can, there may be no need to do anything different on our equity plan. But the third piece is if it turns out we can put all of this in and go to $7.3 billion and we know we can keep our rates below inflation doing that then we might possibly look at equity. That’s the first time you heard me say that in a while but I don't want you to be too concerned because, remember, it is sort of the backup plan to many decisions yet to be made.
We have always said if we ever had a good business proposition that was accretive out the gate, kept the earnings growing the way you like to see it, then we wouldn't be bashful about coming to you. We are way far away from that. We don't see the need to change our description to you that there's no need to issue equity other than the continuous equity program we have over the next several years.
So we are probably in good shape. If, however, we decided that it would be good to issue equity to support this it certainly wouldn't be this year and it wouldn't be next year and then the question is would it be needed in '14 or '15. Uncertain.
So we are still sending the message that we don't need equity. We will be managing the numbers as we go through to see if we can maintain that, but if the growth is going to be that much faster and that much bigger, we are not bashful about coming to you with a good business proposition."

So to put it in scope that's what it looks like. So if we had a no-go decision it would be well into 2013, if not early in '14, and part of it really is dependent, I think, one of the other people asked the question too, what are the environmental rules going to be?
And as Tom talked about our CapEx spend, a lot of our capital expenditures are based on environmental controls for our plants. If things were accelerated, changed, delayed, that may also-- or if new technology develops, it may enable us to use different forms of technology to reach the same outcome. So that will allow us to readjust our capital base.
But timing-wise I give you that time. End of the year, we would pretty much have an idea. Early next year, we would have an idea, specifically that we would be able to move forward with.

So we would need some back up to that to be able to provide our customers the reliability that they expect.
So from an investor standpoint, it actually is an investment opportunity, both renewable energy and backup for capacity.

We brought our numbers down a little bit from the last quarter when we showed you this but what I want to do is offer again what we are seeing so far actually. Because it's kind of like gas prices and things like that, it's the actuals that are the solid numbers and our guesses are just that, and terefore we try to be conservative. They are not shown on the slide. I did mention them but I want to repeat them.
For the first 9 months of the year the growth compared to the first 9 months of the year ago was flat on residential and flat on commercial. So we are staying conservative there. The industrial side was actually up 5.7% for an overall growth of just about 2%. That's what we are looking at. But we said, there seems to be some uncertainty in this election period and that makes us want to be conservative.
Then there is another event going on that, unfortunately, we can't talk a lot about, but I mentioned that some of our renewable type of customers are struggling in this political environment that's going on. So their numbers, we think should be a bit lower. I can't say much more than that. We tried to factor that into our fourth quarter. They get special contracts. So there is not profit margin to speak of there, but we brought that number down to 1.3% in total, which is about where we were last year for growth and not that far off from where we were for 2010.
We are going to give you more in 2013 when we get out to our guidance early in the year and maybe we will talk about it more as we get to the end of the year, but we felt for the rest of this year, we just want to be conservative. We don't want to plan for something that's better than it turns out; and if it turns out better, great. Usually that's a help in one way or another.
So those are the facts about the 9 months and that's the guidance for the year. So even though the first 9 months are up about 2%, we are saying that for the full year we should be about 1.3%, the industrial will still be pretty good in that, and we still think residential and commercial will be following, as people's confidence grow and the economy continues to grow. Does that help you enough for now?"

So we were moving towards that end. Your point about, is there more political demand for renewable energy, I think was a good way to state it. I think there's certain people that have a political view that want more renewable energy than others. I will tell you, our view here at the company, my view personally, I like renewable energy. We support it. But I want to balance portfolio.
It is more expensive for our customers, renewable energy is more expensive, particularly compared to baseload with gas today. It's an intermittent resource, and with our first wind park that we just built we find that people like to have renewable energy until you actually locate it. Then it becomes a little bit more of a challenge when you start getting into sighting and zoning and some of the issues that we run into and if you are familiar with Michigan, we are basically a peninsula and to hit the targets that would be required by 25x25, it's likely we would have to go offshore with wind, which is another issue that becomes a huge political issue, and a local zoning issue, too."

We haven't seen anything come to fruition yet but I do think there's opportunities there. But usually what we get into is it's more smaller scale. We tend to believe, we would rather have large, a wind farm compared to a turbine on one-off, or solar panels and so forth. But we are working with them. If we find the opportunity we will certainly advance it."

Thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year, and then, as usual, we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54 a share, up a penny from last year. Year-to-date results of $1.31 a share, keeps us on track to achieve our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55. By rightsizing the business over the past 3 years, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of increased productivity and system efficiencies. Reducing the workforce by 7% in those years helps us keep our customer base rates at or below the rate of inflation for the next 5 years.
In September, we filed electric rate case seeking an increase of $148 million. Tom and I will detail some of the features of this case in a minute. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term capital investment plan. I will update you on a few of the major projects, as well as our position on a ballot proposal that could result in significantly greater investments in renewable energy.
In just a few years, we see a capacity shortfall. In order to meet our peak load requirements, we will need to fill that shortfall. I will discuss a few of the options we are considering as well as the impact on our financial plan.
As mentioned, we filed a new electric rate case seeking $148 million in rate relief. 85% of the request is made up of capital investments. These investments enable us to deliver safe, reliable energy and keep our O&M costs down. As you can see on the right panel, we continue to bring capital-driven cases to the commission. In the future we believe that annual rate cases may be avoided if there is an adjustment mechanism to recover projected investments.
We are also requesting a 10.5% return on equity, up from our current authorized level of 10.3%. Tom will discuss some of the specific mechanisms we have proposed to help streamline future rate cases.
Operationally, we continue to make good progress on our long-term capital investment plan. As you know, we have a disciplined plan which limits our investments to hold customer rates to an affordable price. The Ludington Pumped Storage Project is underway. All 6 units will be upgraded one at a time during an outage that starts in September and runs until May. The first urban upgrade will be completed in May 2014. When the last outage is completed in 2019, we will have increased the capacity by 300 megawatts and improved the operational efficiency and reliability.
At Lake Winds, we are on schedule to begin commercial operation of this 101 megawatt wind park later this year, with all of the 56 turbines having been constructed and we are currently in the testing phase.
In our smart reader program-- our smart meter program is underway on the West side of the state. As we ramp up installations, we expect to have installed 250,000 meters by the end of next year.
Of course we are all aware of the upcoming November 6 elections. In Michigan, we are paying close attention to ballot Proposal 3, that we refer to as 25x25. If passed, this proposal would require us to produce 25% of our power from renewables by the year 2025, up from the current requirement of 10% by 2015. You can see on the right panel the consequences of Proposal 3 passing.
Michigan would need at least 5,000 megawatts more of wind capacity at a cost of about $12 billion. Michigan would be the only state in the country to pass a constitutional amendment mandating renewable energy. We believe this is the wrong way to implement a renewable energy policy. The 2008 Energy Law has provided a constructive framework to implement energy policy including renewable energy standards.
As we look forward a few years, we anticipate a capacity shortfall with a drop of coal plants being retired due to natural  oil. With the probability that our classic seven coal plants will be mothballed in either 2015 or 2016 and MISO increasing its reserve capacity to potentially 18%, our shortfall could be as high as 1,500 megawatts.
Our renewable energy expansion in wind farms and at the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant will not be enough to close the gap. We will need to add more capacity and it appears that gas generation will be the fuel of choice. We will carefully evaluate all options including purchasing assets or building new capacity in Michigan. I expect we will need to make the decision in 2013.
We talk a lot about the flexibility of our investment plan. Our 2013 to 2017 plan calls for $6.5 billion of investments. With the capacity shortfall on the near horizon, this plan could easily be adjusted to accommodate a new gas-generating plant. If we determine buying or building new gas generation is the most economic option for our customers our investment plan may grow by as much as $800 million. Even with this increase to the plan, average customer base rates would be held below 2%.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to talk about the results for the quarter."

This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell, it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.",1381,"Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today, for this is our best performance in over 10 years. This represents a decade of consistently improving results and as you can tell, it’s a track record that we are proud to deliver to you.
Our third-quarter reported results were $0.55 a share or $0.54, excluding a favorable legacy insurance claim. Adjusted earnings were up a $0.01 a share. The utility was up $0.03 with stronger sales and regulatory performance more than offsetting planned investments and accelerated reliability work. Enterprises and the parent were down $0.02 primarily reflecting the Michigan state tax benefit in 2011 not repeated this year.
Now here is a slide that’s become a bit more popular than we expected. It's an update of the version we showed to you in the first half of the year during our last earnings call. As you can see, we have offset fully the adverse implications of the mild winter earlier this year. We also have put to use the earnings benefit of the hotter-than-normal summer by investing more in tree trimming, generating plant maintenance and system hardening.
We have a few more opportunities and are planning those with great care to ensure that our prospects for delivering earnings growth at 5% to 7% are not compromised, while at the same time we reinvest as much as we can for our customers. We don't want to overearn and we don't want to underearn our authorized ROE and we plan to deliver our earnings growth commitment while maximizing every opportunity to improve the conditions for our customers.
Our belief is pretty simple. When our customers win and when you win as investors, we are successful. So here is our performance, year-to-date.
This is the highest level in over 10 years, and here is our forecast for the final 3 months of the year. Now if weather is normal and modest sales growth continues we should be right on target to deliver earnings in the $1.52 to the $1.55 range.
In today's uncertain world, some of you ask us about Michigan and its economy. To provide a better perspective here is a comparison of a few economic indicators for the U.S., Michigan and our service territory. While U.S. unemployment peaked in the last recession at about 10%, it has come down to around 8%. In Michigan, unemployment peaked at 14% and we have seen substantial improvement, but it's still high-- around 9%.
If you look at two major regions in the state, the Central and Western regions, which make up a big part of our service territory, you will see that unemployment reached about 11% and has since declined to about 6.5%. Over the last 12 months employment in these regions has improved by about 2.5% which compares with the overall U.S. growth at 2% and Michigan at 1%. We are fortunate to serve a portion of Michigan that’s economically more attractive than conditions in the state as a whole.
Continuing on with the economy, the Michigan economic index has improved substantially since the middle of 2009. Evidence of the rebound includes U.S. auto sales, up 15% from last year to about 15 million vehicle sales, non-farm payrolls up 46,000 or 1.2% and manufacturing jobs up more than 3%, while Michigan has improved from 18 to 12 in the ranking of tax friendly states. We continue to see signs of further improvement, although uncertainty has grown during this election cycle.
Here is another slide with which I think you have become pretty familiar with, and it shows our electric sales, weather adjusted, over the last 35 years. Recall that the worst recession we have ever seen was in the early 1980s but the recovery from the most recent recession has been slower. In fact, as we stick with our cautionary approach to forecasting sales, we have lowered our outlook for 2012 to 1.3%.
Now that’s the same as last year's growth. For the first 9 months, sales were actually up 2%. Excluding energy efficiency work, the underlying economic growth was about 3% and we forecast about 2.5% for the year. That's about the same growth as over the last two years.
Now let's get back to the net numbers. The net sales improvement forecast at 1.3% for the year includes year-to-date growth of 2%. This continues to be driven by industrial sales growth of 5.7% on top of 3.6% last year and 10% 2 years ago. Residential and commercial sales lag. They remain flat.
The primary reason we have lowered the growth rate a bit is because industrial customers that rely heavily on products supplying the renewable energy sector have seen a slowing in their growth rates. These are customers that generate little margin for us because they are provided with special rates. Unfortunately we can't share more detail with you, but suffice it to say, their impact on our profit is minimal.
On a related subject, most of you are aware that we no longer have decoupling for our electric business following an appeals court decision addressing another utility. Because the appeals court judge was clear that tracker-like mechanisms are permitted, we have requested a revenue adjustment mechanism in our recently filed electric rate case. For the gas business, decoupling is still permitted and while we suspended its use temporarily with the most recent gas rates settlement we plan to request continuation in the future.
Now, John covered the newly filed electric rate case just a few moments ago. I thought I would discuss some of our proposed process improvements that are reflected in that case. Most of you are familiar with the 2008 Michigan Energy Law that provides for more timely rate making, limited competition, energy optimization and renewable generation.
In our new electric rate case, we have proposed some additional steps to make the process even more efficient and effective. These include a revenue adjustment mechanism consistent with the appeals court decoupling ruling. These also include potential adjustment mechanisms for pension and retiree healthcare, as well as uncollectible accounts.
For example, if we are able to make expected progress with uncollectible accounts, this mechanism will permit us to share the benefit with our customers quicker than waiting for another rate case. In addition, we propose a 2-year capital investment recovery mechanism, also to provide more efficiency. Should the commission choose to support this mechanism, then it's not likely that we will need to request another rate case for 2 years.
As you know, the bulk of our rate cases are about capital recovery and returning improved levels of O&M to our customers. The capital investment portion of this request is 85% of total. There are other features designed to improve reliability for our customers. For example, we are requesting the resources to shorten our tree trimming cycle from about 14 years to around 8 years, and that's all good news for our customers. All in all, this rate case is intended to minimize customer volatility and provide more certainty to you as investors.
Talking about stability and certainty, here is the latest look at our liquidity. At mid-year, we were at 32% of market cap, almost twice the level of our peers. S&P and Moody's outlooks for both the parent and the utility are positive, and we are grateful for this vote of confidence and the improvement we have made to our cash flow metrics and to our balance sheet.
Here is our traditional cash flow forecast for both the parent and the utility. As you can see, most of the financing is complete and the plans continue on a strong track. This is our earnings and cash flow sensitivity updated for the latest conditions. You can use this tool for assessing both 2012 and 2013 conditions
So we are on track to deliver on all of our financial targets, as shown here. We feel good about our prospects for this year and for next. John and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI conference where we will present on Tuesday, November 13 at 8:15 Mountain Time-- 8:15 AM, that is.
We would be pleased now to take your questions. So, Operator, would you be kind enough to open the line for those questions."

Obviously, you went a slightly different route than DTE has with the commission, and I am wondering if maybe you could give a little bit of detail around how your revenue mechanism might work? Then secondly, you mentioned that the capital recovery mechanism would be the main driver of whether or not you are going to be a regular filer. Is that kind of a black-and-white situation? If you don't get the CapEx adjustment but everything else, might that still help you stay up?"

We are in the situation where most of our request of the Public Service Commission is all around capital investment. So as John showed you in one of the earlier slides, which you can go back and look at, in our last 3 rate cases, as well as this one that we are provided for now, the bulk again is capital investment. So to take your second question first, if we had some form of, I will call it a tracker, but it is more like a revenue adjustment mechanism, that permitted us just to have a plan in place where we would have the normal year covered as we wouldn't have in the rate case, and then the next test year also covered and then there would be a good opportunity for the commission and its staff to audit just like it does on pass-throughs at GCRs, and PSCRs the fact that we followed exactly the plan and any changes that were made to the plan would be accommodated in the audit process later. If we were able to do all of that, then there would be no need to come in for a rate case. Basically what we do is we are typically holding our O&M flat to down a little bit and that's the other reason that you might need a rate case, where if we are in that zone of flat to down, the only disappointment is our desire to continue to give our customers more rate relief by passing that O&M through to them. So we are looking at a 2-year trial. Some people have suggested that maybe a 3-year approach would be better. So we wouldn't have to come in for rate cases for 3 years. But our view is, let's take it easy. First step, let's do 2 years. If the commission supports that approach, then yes. We don’t see a need to come back on the electric side for a couple years for another rate case and if they support that we would consider that in our gas business as well and look for an opportunity that might permit us to stay out of rate cases there may be for 2 or 3 years. Mark, don't think of it like freeze. That's not what we are trying to do here. We are just trying to be more efficient and more effective with the rate-making process and make it easier for everybody who has to administer it but take no exceptions to doing it with excellence and perfection, and I think most people would agree that it's probably nice to avoid the detail of a rate case if you've got a simple plan on your capital investment. So yes, it is a little bit of an on-off switch, and I think that's a fair comparison. If we get the support from the commission, we probably won't be back for a couple years. If they would like to us in each year for those capital requests, we would be happy to do that as well. Now your second question on the revenue mechanism. Do think of it as just a way for us to put something new and different in place now that we don't have electric decoupling. We have it for gas, but not for electric. Though since the commission has full authority over tracking type mechanisms, we are asking for this revenue adjustment-which would, it's a very simple-- the math looks complicated but it's really a simple request. It just says whatever is in our rate case, if the sales are better, whether it's for energy efficiency or whether it's for the economy or whether it's for the weather. Whatever might happen there, then we would share that good news back with our customers. Good for them, good for us and good for you. If it's the other way and it goes down, same thing. We would share that. So it provides more stability and cost in rates that our customers see, and more stability for you as investors. It's really that's straightforward.
Now when the commission goes through it, I am sure they are going to be thinking carefully about what they would like to do, and they have some obvious choices on whether they are going to include weather, or the economy, or energy efficiency. We are certain though we would look favorably on energy efficiency since they have been strong supporters of what's in the Energy Law on that subject but there will be choices for them and we will share our thoughts and then they will make the final decision and we will be happy with whatever they conclude.

So you are going to get decoupling for the prior year in your gas numbers and then you won't have it when you come to the new years. Also remember, on the gas side, we never had decoupling for weather. We had it for the economy and for energy efficiency. So this mild weather that we had in the first quarter of the year, even early in the spring, all that flows through. So when you look at something like Slide # 12 and you see $0.13 of bad news, it says around March 31 but that's really dipping into April just a little bit. That’s primarily the weather flow through on the gas side. Then you look at the hot summer there's a lot of ups and downs in there but in the red part through July 23, $0.13 that's really most of that good news of hot weather. If that helps you, I will stop there, but we can go further if you would like."

I think that should be a key goal of management and the board.

You will have job when you need it. Just kidding. Let me just remind, because I think most everyone on the call has heard us say this, John and I, before, and I want to remind you of our approach. We have a great deal of respect, as do many, for the rating agencies and we spend a lot of time trying to give them a look for 5-plus years out on what the business looks like and any time there's anything happening we give them detail on those 5 years to keep them up to speed. We put absolutely no pressure on them regarding ratings and I know you don't want to hear that others don't like to hear that but here's why. It's our view, as they do a good job and make they will make the call when they think it's appropriate to make the call. Consequently, we are very happy that both S&P and Moody's do have the parent and utility on a positive outlook. We are grateful for that, but we are not pushing them to make a change. We just want them to see the data and do the right thing. One little pieces of logic is this simple. I would rather have them make an upgrade when they believe they are comfortable with it, so that their look is or at least 50-50 in the future, then have you as investors be concerned that the rating that we have has little more downside than it does upside. I would rather be the other way. So as a board and as a management team, we are very focused on having a strong healthy balance sheet that supports the business today and going forward and we are hopeful that the rating agencies will take a view that that merits having a credit rating that's more positive than it is today, but they will get there when they do. So our job is to run the business well and improve it every day, and their job is to assess it and share that with you and I think they have sent you a signal and I have no predictions to offer as to what they might do and when they would do that; obviously they will do that on their own. Hope that color helps you a little bit because we do view it as an important subject."

That’s what we think a unit of the optimal size will be, but what I want to make sure and clear and set the tone for everyone, we are still evaluating this right now. This is more of a heads up for you. We have room to do it. It will affect the plan somewhat but it is certainly something that we can afford but we need to make sure that we do have the plan in place to know that is the right choice. It changes our balance of the portfolio a little bit in our fleet but based on natural gas prices going forward, I think that is the right thing to do, which keeps us well-balanced, but a little heavier on natural gas than we are today.

I would just preface the discussion on equity with, just add to what john just said that the range of spending he just showed you in the little bubble, $6.5 billion to $7.3 billion, is a range because we may be able to offset some of that with other things we would do differently in order to constantly focused on how to keep that number around $7 billion so we make sure that our customer rates don't go higher than the level of inflation. That's driver number one and therefore you would have a sustainable growth plan that goes for years and years. So the first choice is, do we do it or not? The second choice is, can we create some offsets, and if we can, there may be no need to do anything different on our equity plan. But the third piece is if it turns out we can put all of this in and go to $7.3 billion and we know we can keep our rates below inflation doing that then we might possibly look at equity. That’s the first time you heard me say that in a while but I don't want you to be too concerned because, remember, it is sort of the backup plan to many decisions yet to be made. We have always said if we ever had a good business proposition that was accretive out the gate, kept the earnings growing the way you like to see it, then we wouldn't be bashful about coming to you. We are way far away from that. We don't see the need to change our description to you that there's no need to issue equity other than the continuous equity program we have over the next several years. So we are probably in good shape. If, however, we decided that it would be good to issue equity to support this it certainly wouldn't be this year and it wouldn't be next year and then the question is would it be needed in '14 or '15. Uncertain. So we are still sending the message that we don't need equity. We will be managing the numbers as we go through to see if we can maintain that, but if the growth is going to be that much faster and that much bigger, we are not bashful about coming to you with a good business proposition."

If things were accelerated, changed, delayed, that may also-- or if new technology develops, it may enable us to use different forms of technology to reach the same outcome. So that will allow us to readjust our capital base. But timing-wise I give you that time. End of the year, we would pretty much have an idea.

We brought our numbers down a little bit from the last quarter when we showed you this but what I want to do is offer again what we are seeing so far actually. Because it's kind of like gas prices and things like that, it's the actuals that are the solid numbers and our guesses are just that, and therefore we try to be conservative. They are not shown on the slide. I did mention them but I want to repeat them. For the first 9 months of the year the growth compared to the first 9 months of the year ago was flat on residential and flat on commercial. So we are staying conservative there. The industrial side was actually up 5.7% for an overall growth of just about 2%. That's what we are looking at. But we said, there seems to be some uncertainty in this election period and that makes us want to be conservative. Then there is another event going on that, unfortunately, we can't talk a lot about, but I mentioned that some of our renewable type of customers are struggling in this political environment that's going on. So their numbers, we think should be a bit lower. I can't say much more than that. We tried to factor that into our fourth quarter. They get special contracts. So there is not profit margin to speak of there, but we brought that number down to 1.3% in total, which is about where we were last year for growth and not that far off from where we were for 2010. We are going to give you more in 2013 when we get out to our guidance early in the year and maybe we will talk about it more as we get to the end of the year, but we felt for the rest of this year, we just want to be conservative. We don't want to plan for something that's better than it turns out; and if it turns out better, great. Usually that's a help in one way or another. So those are the facts about the 9 months and that's the guidance for the year. So even though the first 9 months are up about 2%, we are saying that for the full year we should be about 1.3%, the industrial will still be pretty good in that, and we still think residential and commercial will be following, as people's confidence grow and the economy continues to grow.

So I guess what I am sort of wondering is, if there is a potential for renewable generation, how you are putting that you plan? Do you follow me because like you said, if there is a higher requirement, one would think that perhaps you would focused more on ""renewables"". Do you follow what I am saying?"

We have a law in place today that requires us to get the 10% renewable energy by 2015. It also has energy efficiency standards and other things that are associated with it to reduce, like electric sales by 5%, or gas sales by about 4% by 2015. We are well on our way to achieve those targets. We have made the investments at Lake Winds. We are working on Cross Winds, the other major utilities in Michigan are doing the same thing. So we were moving towards that end. Your point about, is there more political demand for renewable energy, I think was a good way to state it. I think there's certain people that have a political view that want more renewable energy than others. I will tell you, our view here at the company, my view personally, I like renewable energy. We support it. But I want to balance portfolio. It is more expensive for our customers, renewable energy is more expensive, particularly compared to baseload with gas today. It's an intermittent resource, and with our first wind park that we just built we find that people like to have renewable energy until you actually locate it. Then it becomes a little bit more of a challenge when you start getting into sighting and zoning and some of the issues that we run into and if you are familiar with Michigan, we are basically a peninsula and to hit the targets that would be required by 25x25, it's likely we would have to go offshore with wind, which is another issue that becomes a huge political issue, and a local zoning issue, too."

I was just wondering, combined heat and power, you working with the industrial customers, are there any opportunities there, perhaps, as a means to deal with the renewable or the environmental desires of some and perhaps a way of meeting your capacity needs or the system capacity needs for your service territory? Is that something that’s kicking up? We are hearing about a lot of other states pursuing it more aggressively. I am just wondering if there's anything going on there with you guys?"

The smaller ones, we do some one-off things with our smaller customers, but the bigger customers, you are right. We have talked to them about it. We will continue to work with them about opportunities to satisfy their need for renewable energy along with our need for renewable energy. We haven't seen anything come to fruition yet but I do think there's opportunities there. But usually what we get into is it's more smaller scale. We tend to believe, we would rather have large, a wind farm compared to a turbine on one-off, or solar panels and so forth. But we are working with them. If we find the opportunity we will certainly advance it."
