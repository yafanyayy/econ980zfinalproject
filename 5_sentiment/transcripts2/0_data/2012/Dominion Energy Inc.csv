For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment.

We complet",2189,"Good morning. For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record setting safety performance. We completed several major capital projects in our strategic growth plan and made significant progress in the construction of several others. We also worked to secure the contractual commitments and regulatory approvals necessary for the next round of projects that should sustain our growth plan for the foreseeable future. 
We delivered operating earnings per share within our guidance range in the face of a sluggish yet improving economy, weak commodity prices and mild weather, particularly in the fourth quarter. Shareholders were rewarded in 2011 with a total return of 29.4%, which exceeded the returns for most of our industry peers, as well as the overall market. 
Our strategic growth plan consists of investments in new infrastructure in all of our regulated lines of business. At Dominion Generation, it involves the construction of new generation to reduce the existing capacity deficit of Virginia Power, to meet the expected growth in demand from our service territory and replace the generating capacity that is being retired in order to comply with new EPA regulations. 
At Dominion Virginia Power, it involves the modernization of the 500 kV loop that has been the backbone of our electric transmission system, as well as upgrades in new service lines to support demand form new customers, including data centers and to maintain reliability to portions of our service area affected by generation plant retirements. 
At Dominion Energy, it involves the construction of the gathering, processing and transmission infrastructure that will be needed to facilitate the natural gas production from Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. It also includes the systematic replacement of much of the pipeline at work at Dominion East Ohio. This plan involves about $11.6 billion of new plant investment in identified projects over the next 5 years, providing the foundation for our 5% to 6% expected growth in earnings per share beginning this year, which we again affirm today. 
2011 was a year of significant progress at Dominion Generation. Construction of over 90 megawatts Bear Garden Power Station was completed on-time and on budget. The plant began commercial operations on May 23 and had a 126 day continuous run. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 90% complete as of the end of last year. It is on schedule for commercial operations by the middle of this year. This $1.8 billion project is also on time and on budget. Our next large generation construction project is the Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant, which is expected to provide approximately 1,300 megawatts of capacity. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with Corporation State Corporation Commission last May and the hearing was held last month. In order for this commission must be issued no later than next Thursday. If regulatory approvals are received, construction will begin this spring. And the plant should be completed by the end of 2014 at a cost of roughly $1.1 billion. We expect to file the Warren County project with a similar size combined cycle plant for completion in mid- to late 2016. This plant was identified in our 2011 integrated resource plan and will be necessary to offset the reduction in capacity caused by the retirements of older coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations due to the HAPs rule from the EPA. 
Local conditional use permits have already been obtained for potential sites in Chesterfield and Brunswick Counties for the proposed facility. We will make a determination on a specific site this quarter and expect to file for CPCN and Rider with the commission either late this year or early next. Other growth projects at Generation include the conversions of older coal-fired units to burn other fuels. We plan to convert Units 3 and 4 at our station from coal to natural gas. copy engineering and procurement contract for the project last quarter and expect to file a CPCN request with the commission this summer.
We are also converting 3 of our smaller coal units to burn wood. The hearing for this conversions was held in December, and we expect the commission order in March. If approved, work on the $165 million project should be complete next year. 
Dominion Virginia Power completed 2 large 500kV transmission lines during 2011. The Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk were both completed on time and on budget. Work began last year on the Mount Storm-to-Doubs line and will be performed during the spring and fall of the next 3 years at an estimated cost of about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects totaling about $600 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its own growth program in 2011. Construction of the $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer. And the project should be in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as Ellisburg was received in the third quarter of last year, both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012. 
Last year, we announced the Natrium processing project. Construction has begun on Phase I, which is fully contracted and is designed to process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Phase I should cost about $500 million and should be in service by December. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which would be in service for the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our potential liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian basin. On October 3, we filed for approval to export up to equivalent of 365 Bcf per year for 25-year term to non free trade agreement countries. Our filing supports our belief that the project level of many positive economic benefits and we are hopeful for a dealer approval later this year. 
I will now turn to operating results for the year beginning with safety.
Both Dominion Generation and the Dominion Energy reported record or improving safety performance. While some hydrogen generation the best on record incident rate of only 0.33 for 2011, well below their previous record of 0.62 set  last year. Our nuclear business unit had only 5 OSHA records in 2011, yielding an incident rate of just 0.12, it's best on record. But Dominion's East Ohio and Dominion Hope also had the fewest number of reported OSHA recordables in their history. At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work contributed to an increase in both OSHA recordables and loss time restricted duty incidents. However our transmission business went 165 consecutive days without an injury. Our service company has best year ever with only 1 OSHA recordable. Safety continues to be one of our core values at Dominion and we are pleased with our improvement. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well last year. Our Fossil & Hydro utility fleet achieved next forced outage rate of 3.8% with our large coal units surpassing their previous record with the rate of only 3.18%. The peak season equivalent availability of 96% was the highest in the last 3 years. The overall capacity factor for our nuclear fleet declined, just above 90% in 2010 to 85% in 2011. Several natural events contributed to the decline. A tornado last spring touched down in the at our plant and an earthquake that shook the entire East Coast caused both units to be offline for about 80 days. Capacity upgrades for 3 of our 4 nuclear units at Virginia Power have been completed and the final upgrade of 21 megawatts North Anna Unit 1 will be completed during its refueling outage this spring. Dominion Virginia Power had a challenging year in 2011. Hurricane Irene resulted in the loss of power to almost 1.3 million customers. The second-largest restoration effort in company history was completed in less than 9 days at a cost of about $108 million. As compared to Hurricane Isabel in 2003, approximately 2/3 number of customers were affected. However, restoration was completed in half the time and about ½ the cost.
Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. In July, we set a new record system peak load of 20,061 megawatts exceeding the previous record, which had been set in August of 2007. Additionally, PJM's updated forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years, or an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is just 6.2%, well below the national average of 8.5% and is actually only 5% in populist Northern Virginia. Weather adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.6% for 2011, and actually 1.8% if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. Our estimates for weather normalized sales growth in 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. For Dominion Energy, development activity by producers of the Marcellus and Utica Shales continue to grow providing the foundation for it infrastructure projects that are a key component of our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, there were 51 new horizontal Utica well permits issued in Ohio, more than doubling the number in effect at the end of the third quarter. 10 different producers have permitted Utica wells, up from 7 at the end of September and 6 of those producers are currently drilling. Actually, every single Utica well online in the state of Ohio is tied into the wet gas gathering system at Dominion East Ohio.
Producer activity in the Marcellus and Utica formations is occurring despite low natural gas prices due to the economic value of the liquids contained in the gas ring. Our Hastings extraction plant achieved an all-time record reliability factor of 99.3%, leading to an all-time record fractionation volume of over 180 million gallons of NGLs in 2011. After a binding open season held in early November, DTI executed agreements with 3 of the customers of Phase I at Natrium to transport the 185,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation from Natrium to Texas Eastern. You can expect a number of announcements related to various DTI growth projects over the course of this year. 
Regulatory calendar was also fairly active last year, the first biennial review in Virginia statute took place in 2011. The State Corporation Commission issued its order on November 30, determining that earnings from Virginia Power's base rate revenues produced an earned rate of return on common equity in excess of 12.4% in order to refund the customers $78 million. Furthermore, the commission set a return in equity to be used in the second abiding review of 10.9%, which under Virginia's law allows the company turn up to 11.2% before triggering any potential refunds or rate reductions. We are seeking clarification from the commission as to whether the new rate will apply to the entire 24-month period covered by the second review or whether the new rate only became effective as of the date of the commission's order as all of the parties and agreed to in the settlement agreement from the going rate case. 
Our GAAP earnings for 2011, which comprises ½ of the next review period were significantly below the authorized level due to the write-off of the value of our coal units that are being retired, restoration cost related to Hurricane Irene, the inspection costs at brought on by the earthquake and the impairment charge on the value of our care emissions allowances. Furthermore,  the commission's treatment of severance costs related to our 2010 voluntary separation program actually shifted about $100 million of expenses into 2011 further lowering the earned ROE computed for regulatory purposes. 
Finally, I want to comment on our dividend. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which subject to further declarations by the board equates to an annual rate of $2.11 per share. The new rate represents about 65% payout in the midpoint of our earnings guidance range for 2012 and reflects the board's confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets. Last month, our board affirmed our 60% to 65% targeted payout ratio therefore pending board approval, you can expect future dividend increases in line with our earnings growth per share or about 5% to 6% annually.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations for the year. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."

Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year and largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, where at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Oper",1519,"Good morning, everyone. Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year and largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, where at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Operating earnings were $3.05 per share for the year and $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter. Mild weather, particularly in December, reduced earnings by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.45 for the year. 
During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the value of our coal units at our Chesapeake, Yorktown and North Branch Power Stations which will be retired primarily as a result of new EPA emissions regulations.
These charges account for most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter. Other factors for the year include restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, merchant plant retirements, operations and the net impact from the SCC's order in the biannual review. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the fourth quarter was $232 million, which was below the bottom of our guidance range. This was driven primarily by warmer than normal weather plus higher than expected storm restoration expenses. EBIT for Dominion Energy was $258 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Greater than expected earnings from Producer Services and lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission were positive factors. Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $229 million for the fourth quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower merchant generation margins due to lower commodity prices and extended outage at Millstone Unit 3 were principal factors in the lower results. Offsetting lower results from our operating segments were lower interest expense and lower income taxes, both of which came in better than expected. 
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $3.5 billion for 2011, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper outstanding at the end of the year was $1.8 billion resulting in available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Last September, we extended the maturity of our credit facilities to September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity base please see Pages 13 and 26 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to our financing plans. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of tenure notes at Virginia Power. This issue was a carryover from our 2011 financing plan. Excluding that issue, we plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, fairly evenly split between Dominion and. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debts. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings. 
As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment and other stock purchase programs, which will raise about $300 million of new equity. Since our existing SEC shelf registration expires at the end of this month, we plan to file a new universal shelf with the SEC later today to cover financing needs for the next several years. Included in this shelf registration will be the ability to issue common stock through an after money or ATM program. We do not expect to issue any shares under this program this year or to simply creating the flexibility to use this program in future years. When we choose to issue equity above amount raised through our dividend reinvestment an other stock purchase plans. 
Now, to earnings guidance. As Tom said earlier, we expect our operating earnings to grow 5% to 6% this year. Based on our operating earnings of $3.05 per share in 2011, this it would imply an operating earnings range of roughly $3.20 to $3.25 per share for 2012 assuming normal weather. Incorporating some degree of sensitivity to weather and other factors to that range, results in operating earnings guidance for 2012 of $3.10 to $3.35 per share. 
In Slide 8, we have highlighted the principal drivers, positive and negative, to our 5% to 6% growth in 2012. As you can see, interest expense EPCO revenues, rate adjustment clauses and gas transmission and distribution all expected to provide significant growth. On the downside, DD&A and merchant generation margins are negative drivers year-over-year. 
Let me spend a few moments going over these drivers.
First, on Slide 9 is the breakdown of our merchant generation channels. In confirming our growth guidance on our last call, we anticipated a merchant margin reduction in 2012 of about $0.13 to $0.16 per share, mainly driven by the shutdown of our State Line coal units this quarter. However, as shown in the middle of this slide, we currently see an initial challenge of $0.06 to $0.08 based on the recent drop off in our open positions. We plan to offset the additional margin weakness by reducing operating expenses as shown on Slide 10. Our total annual operating and maintenance budget is approximately $3.2 billion. We plan to reduce that by 2% to 3%. I've highlighted a few areas that we are focused on. First, we will have a number of natural offsets due to current depressed 1x and lower margins at our coal units. We expect to have lower variable operating, environment and maintenance costs due to reduced production. We are also evaluating planned maintenance outage schedules and other routine maintenance in all of our businesses to meet this challenge. Finally, we will be closely managing our employee and contractor levels. If you review our expense level performance over the last several years, we believe cost management is a significant strength for us. 
Moving to interest expense on Slide 11. We expect year-over-year interest expense to drop by approximately $30 million as we continue to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Recent swaps and the replacement of maturing debt are expected to be the main drivers. 
On Slide 12, we outlined our anticipated VEPCO sales and revenue growth. Year-over-year sales should grow between 2% to 2.5% with data centers providing nearly half of the uplift. Outside of data centers, our projected sales are estimated to grow only 1% to 1.3%. This may turn out to be conservative.
Moving to rate adjustment clause revenue growth on Slide 13. You can see the transmission, Virginia City and Warren County should provide most of the incremental growth based on the capital spend in these areas. 
And finally on Slide 14, we provide a breakdown of our gas business growth drivers. These projects continue to support of the Utica and Marcellus infrastructure needs. All of these projects have been outlined in the growth plan for some time. We hope the breakdown will truly be helpful and provide the details of how we will grow this year. 
Moving to operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2012, our guidance for the first quarter is $0.85 to $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Please note, we have one additional first quarter nuclear outage in Virginia than last year. A more detailed layout of our earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012 can be found in our earnings guidance kit, which will be posted on our website later today. 
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges Millstone in 2012, increasing the hedging percentage to 80%. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains about $0.04 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is about $0.07 per share. 
As shown on Page 28 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about ¼ of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in pricing in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for 2011 were within the guidance range. Mild weather, particularly in December, led to an operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 that were at the bottom of the ranges given last October. Our operating earnings guidance for 2012 is $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. First quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.85 to $1 per share. And finally, while recent declines in commodity prices present a challenge, we are confident that for control of operating expenses in taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we are well-positioned to meet our growth targets. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

So there is -- we didn't think it was clear from the order that was entered in December whether they were going to do what that settlement agreement called for, which is that the first biannual review ROE, which is 11.9% apply to the first 11 months of the biannual review and the new ROE to the second 13 months or whether they apply to the new ROE to the entire 24 months.

But you also look at the economic activity that is created by the issuance of the permit, new jobs, tax revenues, things like that, that will occur upstream from the facility, with the pipeline operations, processing facilities, drilling jobs, the job that spin-off of that to support functions, et cetera. The study we filed shows that they are very significant beneficial impacts and economic activity from allowing the permit to be issued. But they'll consider that. They'll certainly consider other people's views. They'll look at what the potential is far impacts on gas prices out the to the future.

We expect to have it later this year.

For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record-setting safety performance. We complet",2227,"Good morning. For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record-setting safety performance. We completed several major capital projects in our strategic growth plan and made significant progress in the construction of several others. We also worked to secure the contractual commitments and regulatory approvals necessary for the next round of projects that should sustain our growth plan for the foreseeable future. 
We delivered operating earnings per share within our guidance range in the face of a sluggish, yet improving economy, weak commodity prices and mild weather, particularly in the fourth quarter. Shareholders were rewarded in 2011 with a total return of 29.4%, which exceeded the returns for most of our industry peers as well as the overall market. 
Our strategic growth plan consists of investments in new infrastructure in all of our regulated lines of business. At Dominion Generation, it involves the construction of new generation to reduce the existing capacity deficit of Virginia Power to meet the expected growth in demand from our service territory and to replace the generating capacity that is being retired, in order to comply with new EPA regulations. 
At Dominion Virginia Power, it involves the modernization of the 500 kV loop that has been the backbone of our electric transmission system, as well as upgrades in new service lines to support demand from new customers, including data centers, and to maintain reliability to portions of our service area affected by generation plant retirements. 
At Dominion Energy, it involves the construction of the gathering, processing and transmission infrastructure that will be needed to facilitate the natural gas production from Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. It also includes the systematic replacement of much of the pipeline at work at Dominion East Ohio. All told, this plan involves about $11.6 billion of new plant investment and identified projects over the next 5 years, providing the foundation for our 5% to 6% expected growth in earnings per share beginning this year, which we again affirm today. 
2011 was a year of significant progress at Dominion Generation. Construction of our 90-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station was completed on time and on budget. The plant began commercial operations on May 23 and had a 126-day continuous run. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 95% complete as of the end of last year and is on schedule for commercial operations by the middle of this year. This $1.8 billion project is also on time and on budget. 
Our next large-generation construction project is the Warren County three-on-one combined cycle plant, which is expected to provide approximately 1,300 megawatts of capacity. The CPCN and Rider applications were filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission last May, and the hearing was held last month. An order from this commission must be issued no later than next Thursday. If regulatory approvals are received, construction will begin this spring. And the plant should be completed by the end of 2014 at a cost of roughly $1.1 billion. 
We expect to file the Warren County project with a similar size  combined cycle plant for completion in mid to late 2016. This plant was identified in our 2011 integrated resource plan and will be necessary to offset the reduction in capacity caused by the retirements of older coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations due to the HAPs MACTs [ph] rule from the EPA. 
Local conditional use permits have already been obtained for potential sites in Chesterfield and Brunswick Counties for the proposed facility. We will make a determination on a specific site this quarter and expect to file for a CPCN and rate rider with the commission, either late this year or early next. 
Other growth projects at Generation include the conversions of older coal-fired units to burn other fuels. We plan to convert Units 3 and 4 at our Bremo station from coal to natural gas. The company issued an RFP for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the project last quarter and expect to file a CPCN request with the commission this summer.  We are also converting 3 of our smaller coal units to burn wood. The hearing for this conversions was held in December, and we expect the commission order in March. If approved, work on the $165 million project should be complete next year. 
Dominion Virginia Power completed 2 large 500kV transmission lines during 2011. The Meadow Brook to Loudon and Carson to Suffolk lines were both completed on time and on budget. Work began last year on the modernization of the Mt. Storm to Doubs line and will be performed during the spring and fall of the next 3 years at an estimated cost of about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects totaling about $600 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its own growth program in 2011. Construction of the $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer, and the project should be in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as Ellisburg to Craigs was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012. 
Last year, we announced the Natrium processing project. Construction has begun on Phase I, which is fully contracted and is designed to process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Phase I should cost about $500 million and should be in service by December. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which would be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian Basin. On October 3, we filed for approval to export up to an equivalent of 365 Bcf per year for 25-year term to non-free-trade agreement countries. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits, and we are hopeful for DOE approval later this year. 
I will now turn to operating results for the year, beginning with safety.
Both Dominion Generation and the Dominion Energy reported record or improving safety performance. Fossil & Hydro generation completed a best on-record incident rate of only 0.33 for 2011, well below their previous record of 0.62 set last year. Our nuclear business unit had only 5 OSHA recordables in 2011, yielding an incident rate of just 0.12, it's best on record. Both Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Hope also had the fewest number of OSHA recordables in their history. 
At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work contributed to an increase in both OSHA recordables and lost-time, restricted-duty incidents. However our transmission business went 165 consecutive days without an injury. Our service company has best year ever with only one OSHA recordable. Safety continues to be one of our core values at Dominion, and we are pleased with our improvement. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well last year. Our Fossil & Hydro utility fleet achieved a net forced outage rate of 3.8%, with our large coal units surpassing their previous record with the rate of only 3.18%. The peak season equivalent availability of 96% was the highest in the last 3 years. The overall capacity factor for our nuclear fleet declined from just above 90% in 2010 to 85% in 2011. 
Several natural events contributed to the decline. A tornado last spring touched down in the switchyard at our Surry plant, and an earthquake that shook the entire East Coast caused both North Anna units to be offline for about 80 days.  Capacity upgrades for 3 of our 4 nuclear units at Virginia Power have been completed, and the final upgrade of 21 megawatts at North Anna Unit 1 will be completed during its refueling outage this spring. 
Dominion Virginia Power had a challenging year in 2011. Hurricane Irene resulted in the loss of power to almost 1.3 million customers. The second-largest restoration effort in company history was completed in less than 9 days at a cost of about $108 million. As compared to Hurricane Isabel in 2003, approximately 2/3 the number of customers were affected. However, restoration was completed in half the time and about 1/2 the cost.
Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. In July, we set a new record system peak load of 20,061 megawatts, exceeding the previous record, which had been set in August of 2007. Additionally, PJM's updated forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years, or an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts.  Unemployment in Virginia is just 6.2%, well below the national average of 8.5% and is actually only 5% in populist Northern Virginia. 
Weather adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.6% for 2011, and actually 1.8%, if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. Our estimate for weather-normalized sales growth in 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power, with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
For Dominion Energy, development activities by producers in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions continue to grow, providing the foundation for the infrastructure projects that are a key component of our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, there were 51 new horizontal Utica well permits issued in Ohio, more than doubling the number in effect at the end of the third quarter. 10 different producers have permitted Utica wells, up from 7 at the end of September, and 6 of those producers are currently drilling. Actually, every single Utica well online in the state of Ohio is tied into the wet gas gathering system at Dominion East Ohio.
Producer activity in the Marcellus and Utica formations is occurring despite low natural gas prices due to the economic value of the liquids contained in the gas stream. Our Hastings extraction plant achieved an all-time record reliability factor of 99.3%, leading to an all-time record fractionation volume of over 180 million gallons of NGLs in 2011. After a binding open season held in early November, DTI executed precedent agreements with 3 of the customers at Phase I at Natrium to transport 185,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation from Natrium to Texas Eastern. You can expect a number of announcements related to various DTI growth projects over the course of this year. 
A regulatory calendar was also fairly active last year. The first biannual review on the Virginia's re-regulation statute took place in 2011. The State Corporation Commission issued its order on November 30, determining that earnings from Virginia Power's base rate revenues produced an earned rate of return on common equity in excess of 12.4% in order to refund the customers with $78 million. Furthermore, the commission set a return on equity to be used in the second binding review of 10.9%, which under Virginia's law allows the company to earn up to 11.4% before triggering any potential refunds or rate reductions. We are seeking clarification from the commission as to whether the new rate will apply to the entire 24-month period covered by the second review, or whether the new rate only became effective as of the date of the commission's order as all of the parties had agreed to in the settlement agreement from the going-in rate case. 
Our GAAP earnings for 2011, which comprises 1/2 of the next review period, were significantly below the authorized level due to the write-off of the value of our coal units that are being retired, restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, the inspection costs at North Anna brought on by the earthquake and the impairment charge on the value of our CAIR emissions allowances. Furthermore,  the commission's treatment of severance costs related to our 2010 voluntary separation plan actually shifted about $100 million of expenses into 2011, further lowering the earned ROE computed for regulatory purposes. 
Finally, I want to comment on our dividend. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which subject to further declarations by the board, equates to an annual rate of $2.11 per share. The new rate represents about a 65% payout at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range for 2012, and reflects the board's confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets. Last month, our board affirmed our 60% to 65% targeted payout ratio, therefore pending board approval, you can expect future dividend increases in line with our growth and earnings per share or about 5% to 6% annually.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations for the year. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."

And largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, we're at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Ope",1517,"Good morning, everyone. Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year. And largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, we're at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Operating earnings were $3.05 per share for the year and $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter. Very mild weather, particularly in December, reduced earnings by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter. 
GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.45 for the year.  During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the value of our coal units at our Chesapeake, Yorktown and North Branch Power Stations which will be retired primarily as result of new EPA emissions regulations.  These charges account for most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter. Other factors for the year include restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, merchant plant retirements, Kewaunee operations and the net impact from the SCC's order and the biannual review. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the fourth quarter was $232 million, which was below the bottom of our guidance range. This variance was driven primarily by warmer-than-normal weather plus higher-than-expected storm restoration expenses. EBIT for Dominion Energy was $258 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Greater-than-expected earnings from Producer Services and lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $229 million for the fourth quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower merchant generation margins due to lower commodity prices and extended outage at Millstone Unit 3 were principal factors in the lower results. Offsetting lower results from our operating segments were lower interest expense and lower income taxes, both of which came in better than expected. 
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $3.5 billion for 2011, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper outstanding at the end of the year was $1.8 billion, resulting in available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Last September, we extended the maturity of our credit facilities to September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 26 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to our financing plans. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at Virginia Power. This issue was a carryover from our 2011 financing plan. Excluding that issue, we plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, fairly evenly split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings. 
As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment and other stock purchase programs, which will raise about $300 million of new equity. Since our existing SEC shelf registration expires at the end of this month, we plan to file a new universal shelf with the SEC later today to cover financing needs for the next several years. Included in this shelf registration will be the ability to issue common stock through an at-the-money or ATM program. We do not expect to issue any shares under this program this year or to simply creating the flexibility to use this program in future years, when we choose to issue equity above amount raised through our dividend reinvestment an other stock purchase plans. 
Now to earnings guidance. As Tom said earlier, we expect our operating earnings to grow 5% to 6% this year. Based on our operating earnings of $3.05 per share in 2011, this would imply an operating earnings range of roughly $3.20 to $3.25 per share for 2012, assuming normal weather. Incorporating some degree of sensitivity to weather and other factors to that range, results in operating earnings guidance for 2012 of $3.10 to $3.35 per share. 
On Slide 8, we have highlighted the principal drivers, positive and negative, to our 5% to 6% growth in 2012. As you can see, interest expense, VEPCO revenues, rate adjustment clauses and gas transmission and distribution our expected to provide significant growth. On the downside, DD&A and merchant generation margins are negative drivers year-over-year.  Let me spend a few moments going over these drivers. 
First, on Slide 9 is the breakdown of our merchant generation challenge. In confirming our growth guidance on our last call, we anticipated a merchant margin reduction in 2012 of about $0.13 to $0.16 per share, mainly driven by the shutdown of our State Line coal units this quarter. However, as shown in the middle of this slide, we currently see an initial challenge of $0.06 to $0.08 based on the recent drop off in our open NEPOOL positions. 
We plan to offset the additional margin weakness by reducing operating expenses as shown on Slide 10. Our total annual operating and maintenance budget is approximately $3.2 billion. We plan to reduce that by 2% to 3%. I've highlighted a few areas that we will focus on. First, we will have a number of natural offsets due to the current depressed 1x and lower margins at our coal units. We expect to have lower variable operating, environmental and maintenance costs due to reduced production. We are also evaluating planned maintenance outage schedules and other routine maintenance in all of our businesses to meet this challenge. Finally, we'll be closely managing our employee and contractor levels.  If you review our expense level performance over the last several years, we believe cost management is a significant strength for us. 
Moving to interest expense on Slide 11. We expect year-over-year interest expense to drop by approximately $30 million as we continue to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Recent swaps and the replacement of maturing debt are expected to be the main drivers. 
On Slide 12, we outlined our anticipated VEPCO sales and revenue growth. Year-over-year sales should grow between 2% to 2.5% with data centers providing nearly half of the uplift. Outside of data centers, our projected sales are estimated to grow only 1% to 1.3%. This may turn out to be conservative.
Moving to rate adjustment clause revenue growth on Slide 13. You can see the transmission. Virginia City and Warren County should provide most of the incremental growth based on the capital spend in these areas. 
And finally on Slide 14, we provide a breakdown of our gas business growth drivers. These growth projects continue to support of the Utica and Marcellus infrastructure needs. All of these projects have been outlined in the growth plan for some time. We hope the breakdown will truly be helpful and provide the details of how we will grow this year. 
Moving to operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter is $0.85 to $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Please note, we have one additional first quarter nuclear outage in Virginia than last year. A more detailed layout of our earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012 can be found in our earnings guidance kit, which will be posted on our website later today. 
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedged positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, increasing the hedging percentage to 80%. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains about $0.04 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is about $0.07 per share. 
As shown on Page 28 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in pricing in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for 2011 were within the guidance range. Mild weather, particularly in December, led to an operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 that were at the bottom of the ranges given last October. Our operating earnings guidance for 2012 is $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. First quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.85 to $1 per share. 
And finally, while recent declines in commodity prices present a challenge, we are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we are well positioned to meet our growth targets. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

What matters is getting the non-NAFTA country permit, which is presently under consideration. When you file for that permit, you have to file an economic impact study with it, which we did and is available for review, and you look at a typical economic impact study what -- they're looking at what are the potential impacts on the price of natural gas, if this permit is allowed. But you also look at the economic activity that is created by the issuance of the permit: New jobs, tax revenues. Things like that, that will occur upstream from the facility: a new pipeline operations, processing facilities, drilling jobs, the jobs that spin off of that to support functions, et cetera. The study we filed shows that there are very significant beneficial impacts and economic activity from allowing the permit to be issued, so they'll consider that. They'll certainly consider other people's views. They'll look at what the potential is for impacts on gas prices out into the future. I think if you look at all of it in a balanced way, with all the gas that's available in this country now, and particularly in this region, we think it is likely the permit will be issued. We expect to have it later this year. And if you look at just the map, if you're going to export gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, I think it's pretty likely that's going to happen through the Cove Point facility, just because of the close -- how close we are to the region."

267105,145793398,212335,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2012",2012-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record-setting safety performance. We complet",2223,"Good morning. For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record-setting safety performance. We completed several major capital projects in our strategic growth plan and made significant progress in the construction of several others. We also worked to secure the contractual commitments and regulatory approvals necessary for the next round of projects that should sustain our growth plan for the foreseeable future. 
We delivered operating earnings per share within our guidance range in the face of a sluggish, yet improving economy, weak commodity prices and mild weather, particularly in the fourth quarter. Shareholders were rewarded in 2011 with a total return of 29.4%, which exceeded the returns for most of our industry peers as well as the overall market. 
Our strategic growth plan consists of investments in new infrastructure in all of our regulated lines of business. At Dominion Generation, it involved the construction of new generation to reduce the existing capacity deficit of Virginia Power to meet the expected growth in demand from our service territory and to replace the generating capacity that is being retired, in order to comply with new EPA regulations. 
At Dominion Virginia Power, it involves the modernization of the 500 kV loop that has been the backbone of our electric transmission system, as well as upgrades in new service lines to support demand from new customers, including data centers, and to maintain reliability to portions of our service area affected by generation plant retirements. 
At Dominion Energy, it involves the construction of the gathering, processing and transmission infrastructure that will be needed to facilitate the natural gas production from Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. It also includes the systematic replacement of much of the pipeline network at Dominion East Ohio. All told, this plan involves about $11.6 billion of new plant investment and identified projects over the next 5 years, providing the foundation for our 5% to 6% expected growth in earnings per share beginning this year, which we again affirm today. 
2011 was a year of significant progress at Dominion Generation. Construction of our 90-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station was completed on time and on budget. The plant began commercial operations on May 23 and had a 126-day continuous run. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 95% complete as of the end of last year and is on schedule for commercial operations by the middle of this year. This $1.8 billion project is also on time and on budget. 
Our next large-generation construction project is the Warren County three-on-one combined cycle plant, which is expected to provide approximately 1,300 megawatts of capacity. The CPCN Rider applications were filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission last May, and the hearing was held last month. An order from this commission must be issued no later than next Thursday. If regulatory approvals are received, construction will begin this spring. And the plant should be completed by the end of 2014 at a cost of roughly $1.1 billion. 
We expect to file the Warren County project with a similar size combined cycle plant for completion in mid to late 2016. This plant was identified in our 2011 integrated resource plan and will be necessary to offset the reduction in capacity caused by the retirements of older coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations due to the HAPs MACTs [ph] rule from the EPA. 
Local conditional use permits have already been obtained for potential sites in Chesterfield and Brunswick Counties for the proposed facility. We will make a determination on a specific site this quarter and expect to file for a CPCN and rate rider with the commission, either late this year or early next. 
Other growth projects at Generation include the conversions of older coal-fired units to burn other fuels. We plan to convert Units 3 and 4 at our Bremo station from coal to natural gas. The company issued an RFP for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the project last quarter and expect to file a CPCN request with the commission this summer.  We are also converting 3 of our smaller coal units to burn wood. The hearing for this conversions was held in December, and we expect the commission order in March. If approved, work on the $165 million project should be complete next year. 
Dominion Virginia Power completed 2 large 500kV transmission lines during 2011. The Meadow Brook to Loudon and Carson to Suffolk lines were both completed on time and on budget. Work began last year on the modernization of the Mt. Storm to Doubs line and will be performed during the spring and fall of the next 3 years at an estimated cost of about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects totaling about $600 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its own growth program in 2011. Construction of the $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer, and the project should be in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as Ellisburg to Craigs was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012. 
Last year, we announced the Natrium processing project. Construction has begun on Phase I, which is fully contracted and is designed to process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Phase I should cost about $500 million and should be in service by December. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which would be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. 
With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian Basin. On October 3, we filed for approval to export up to an equivalent of 365 Bcf per year for 25-year term to non-free-trade agreement countries. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits, and we are hopeful for DOE approval later this year. 
I will now turn to operating results for the year, beginning with safety.
Both Dominion Generation and the Dominion Energy reported record or improving safety performance. Fossil & Hydro generation completed a best on-record incident rate of only 0.33 for 2011, well below their previous record of 0.62 set last year. Our nuclear business unit had only 5 OSHA reportables in 2011, yielding an incident rate of just 0.12, its best on record. Both Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Hope also had the fewest number of OSHA reportables in their history. 
At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work contributed to an increase in both OSHA reportables and lost-time, restricted-duty incidents. However our transmission business went 165 consecutive days without an injury. Our service company has best year ever with only one OSHA reportable. Safety continues to be one of our core values at Dominion, and we are pleased with our improvement. 
Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well last year. Our Fossil & Hydro utility fleet achieved a net forced outage rate of 3.8%, with our large coal units surpassing their previous record with the rate of only 3.18%. The peak season equivalent availability of 96% was the highest in the last 3 years. The overall capacity factor for our nuclear fleet declined from just above 90% in 2010 to 85% in 2011. 
Several natural events contributed to the decline. A tornado last spring touched down in the switchyard at our Surry plant, and an earthquake that shook the entire East Coast caused both North Anna units to be offline for about 80 days.  Capacity upgrades for 3 of our 4 nuclear units at Virginia Power have been completed, and the final upgrade of 21 megawatts at North Anna Unit 1 will be completed during its refueling outage this spring. 
Dominion Virginia Power had a challenging year in 2011. Hurricane Irene resulted in the loss of power to almost 1.3 million customers. The second-largest restoration effort in company history was completed in less than 9 days at a cost of about $108 million. As compared to Hurricane Isabel in 2003, approximately 2/3 the number of customers were affected. However, restoration was completed in half the time and about 1/2 the cost.
Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. In July, we set a new record system peak load of 20,061 megawatts, exceeding the previous record, which had been set in August of 2007. Additionally, PJM's updated forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years, or an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts.  Unemployment in Virginia is just 6.2%, well below the national average of 8.5% and is actually only 5% in populist Northern Virginia. 
Weather adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.6% for 2011, and actually 1.8%, if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. Our estimate for weather-normalized sales growth in 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power, with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
For Dominion Energy, development activities by producers in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions continue to grow, providing the foundation for the infrastructure projects that are a key component of our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, there were 51 new horizontal Utica well permits issued in Ohio, more than doubling the number in effect at the end of the third quarter. 10 different producers have permitted Utica wells, up from 7 at the end of September, and 6 of those producers are currently drilling. Actually, every single Utica well online in the state of Ohio is tied into the wet gas gathering system at Dominion East Ohio.
Producer activity in the Marcellus and Utica formations is occurring despite low natural gas prices due to the economic value of the liquids contained in the gas stream. Our Hastings extraction plant achieved an all-time record reliability factor of 99.3%, leading to an all-time record fractionation volume of over 180 million gallons of NGLs in 2011. After a binding open season held in early November, DTI executed precedent agreements with 3 of the customers at Phase I at Natrium to transport 185,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation from Natrium to Texas Eastern. You can expect a number of announcements related to various DTI growth projects over the course of this year. 
Our regulatory calendar was also fairly active last year. The first biannual review on the Virginia's re-regulation statute took place in 2011. The State Corporation Commission issued its order on November 30, determining that earnings from Virginia Power's base rate revenues produced an earned rate of return on common equity in excess of 12.4% in order to refund to customers $78 million. Furthermore, the commission set a return on equity to be used in the second binding review of 10.9%, which under Virginia's law allows the company to earn up to 11.4% before triggering any potential refunds or rate reductions. We are seeking clarification from the commission as to whether the new rate will apply to the entire 24-month period covered by the second review, or whether the new rate only became effective as of the date of the commission's order as all of the parties had agreed to in the settlement agreement from the going-in rate case. 
Our GAAP earnings for 2011, which comprises 1/2 of the next review period, were significantly below the authorized level due to write-off of the value of our coal units that are being retired, restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, the inspection costs at North Anna brought on by the earthquake and the impairment charge on the value of our CAIR emissions allowances. Furthermore,  the commission's treatment of severance costs related to our 2010 voluntary separation plan actually shifted about $100 million of expenses into 2011, further lowering the earned ROE computed for regulatory purposes. 
Finally, I want to comment on our dividend. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which subject to further declarations by the board, equates to an annual rate of $2.11 per share. The new rate represents about a 65% payout at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range for 2012, and reflects the board's confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets. Last month, our board affirmed our 60% to 65% targeted payout ratio, therefore pending board approval, you can expect future dividend increases in line with our growth and earnings per share or about 5% to 6% annually.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations for the year. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and I now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,145793398,212335,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2012",2012-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year. And largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, we're at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Ope",1515,"Good morning, everyone. Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year. And largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, we're at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Operating earnings were $3.05 per share for the year and $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter. Very mild weather, particularly in December, reduced earnings by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter. 
GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.45 for the year.  During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the value of our coal units at our Chesapeake, Yorktown and North Branch Power Stations which will be retired primarily as result of new EPA emissions regulations.  These charges account for most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter. Other factors for the year include restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, merchant plant retirements, Kewaunee operations and the net impact from the SCC's order and the biannual review. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the fourth quarter was $232 million, which was below the bottom of our guidance range. This variance was driven primarily by warmer-than-normal weather plus higher-than-expected storm restoration expenses. EBIT for Dominion Energy was $258 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Greater-than-expected earnings from Producer Services and lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission were positive factors. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $229 million for the fourth quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower merchant generation margins due to lower commodity prices and extended outage at Millstone Unit 3 were principal factors in the lower results. Offsetting lower results from our operating segments were lower interest expense and lower income taxes, both of which came in better than expected. 
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $3.5 billion for 2011, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper outstanding at the end of the year was $1.8 billion, resulting in available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Last September, we extended the maturity of our credit facilities to September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 26 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to our financing plans. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at Virginia Power. This issue was a carryover from our 2011 financing plan. Excluding that issue, we plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, fairly evenly split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings. 
As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment and other stock purchase programs, which will raise about $300 million of new equity. Since our existing SEC shelf registration expires at the end of this month, we plan to file a new universal shelf with the SEC later today to cover financing needs for the next several years. Included in this shelf registration will be the ability to issue common stock through an at-the-money or ATM program. We do not expect to issue any shares under this program this year. We're simply creating the flexibility to use this program in future years, when we choose to issue equity above amount raised through our dividend reinvestment in other stock purchase plans. 
Now to earnings guidance. As Tom said earlier, we expect our operating earnings to grow 5% to 6% this year. Based on our operating earnings of $3.05 per share in 2011, this would imply an operating earnings range of roughly $3.20 to $3.25 per share for 2012, assuming normal weather. Incorporating some degree of sensitivity to weather and other factors to that range, results in operating earnings guidance for 2012 of $3.10 to $3.35 per share. 
On Slide 8, we have highlighted the principal drivers, positive and negative, to our 5% to 6% growth in 2012. As you can see, interest expense, VEPCO revenues, rate adjustment clauses and gas transmission and distribution are expected to provide significant growth. On the downside, DD&A and merchant generation margins are negative drivers year-over-year.  Let me spend a few moments going over these drivers. 
First, on Slide 9 is the breakdown of our merchant generation challenge. In confirming our growth guidance on our last call, we anticipated a merchant margin reduction in 2012 of about $0.13 to $0.16 per share, mainly driven by the shutdown of our State Line coal units this quarter. However, as shown in the middle of this slide, we currently see an initial challenge of $0.06 to $0.08 based on the recent drop off in our open NEPOOL positions. 
We plan to offset the additional margin weakness by reducing operating expenses as shown on Slide 10. Our total annual operating and maintenance budget is approximately $3.2 billion. We plan to reduce that by 2% to 3%. I've highlighted a few areas that we will focus on. First, we will have a number of natural offsets due to current depressed 1x and lower margins at our coal units. We expect to have lower variable operating, environmental and maintenance costs due to reduced production. We are also evaluating planned maintenance outage schedules and other routine maintenance in all of our businesses to meet this challenge. Finally, we'll be closely managing our employee and contractor levels.  If you review our expense level performance over the last several years, we believe cost management is a significant strength for us. 
Moving to interest expense on Slide 11. We expect year-over-year interest expense to drop by approximately $30 million as we continue to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Recent swaps and the replacement of maturing debt are expected to be the main drivers. 
On Slide 12, we outlined our anticipated VEPCO sales and revenue growth. Year-over-year sales should grow between 2% to 2.5% with data centers providing nearly half of the uplift. Outside of data centers, our projected sales are estimated to grow only 1% to 1.3%. This may turn out to be conservative.
Moving to rate adjustment clause revenue growth on Slide 13. You can see the transmission Virginia City and Warren County should provide most of the incremental growth based on the capital spend in these areas. 
And finally on Slide 14, we provide a breakdown of our gas business growth drivers. These growth projects continue to support of the Utica and Marcellus infrastructure needs. All of these projects have been outlined in the growth plan for some time. We hope the breakdown will truly be helpful and provide the details of how we will grow this year. 
Moving to operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter is $0.85 to $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Please note, we have one additional first quarter nuclear outage in Virginia than last year. A more detailed layout of our earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012 can be found in our earnings guidance kit, which will be posted on our website later today. 
As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedged positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, increasing the hedging percentage to 80%. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains about $0.04 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is about $0.07 per share. 
As shown on Page 28 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in pricing in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for 2011 were within the guidance range. Mild weather, particularly in December, led to an operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 that were at the bottom of the ranges given last October. Our operating earnings guidance for 2012 is $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. First quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.85 to $1 per share. 
And finally, while recent declines in commodity prices present a challenge, we are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we are well positioned to meet our growth targets.

It's accelerating in the wet gas, which supports -- and there's not enough facilities in Ohio or West Virginia or Pennsylvania to handle all the wet gas that's coming online.

So there's a -- we didn't think it was clear from the order that was entered in December whether they were going to do what that settlement agreement called for, which was that the first biannual review ROE, which was 11.9% apply to the first 11 months of the biannual review, and the new ROE to the second 13 months, or whether they were going to apply to the new ROE to the entire 24 months.

When you file for that permit, you have to file an economic impact study with it, which we did and is available for review, and you look at a typical economic impact study what -- they're looking at what are the potential impacts on the price of natural gas, if this permit is allowed. But you also look at the economic activity that is created by the issuance of the permit: New jobs, tax revenues. Things like that, that will occur upstream from the facility: a new pipeline operations, processing facilities, drilling jobs, the jobs that spin off of that to support functions, et cetera. The study we filed shows that there are very significant beneficial impacts and economic activity from allowing the permit to be issued, so they'll consider that. They'll certainly consider other people's views. They'll look at what the potential is for impacts on gas prices out into the future. I think if you look at all of it in a balanced way, with all the gas that's available in this country now, and particularly in this region, we think it is likely the permit will be issued. We expect to have it later this year.

Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record reduced earnings by $0.11 pe",1237,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services. Offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher completion from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. For Dominion Virginia Power EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was about the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail. First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from whether, the mild weather had $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.
Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. To offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken earlier in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but the income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Power Station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate be between 36% and 37%.
Moving in the cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.
For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and debt. This amount includes the replacement about $1.5 billion and maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 that offerings and made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates of approximately 50% of our 2013 rates as part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.
In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. we were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels have validated our view of the value of the securities.
In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included in less than $0.01 cent of weather held. While its still early in the quarter at least the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. Although weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. But it's too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include, sales growth at Virginia Power. Higher writer related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.
At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather have added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, for our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge position on page 29 of our earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remained at 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in our New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.
As shown on Slide 8 since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output that prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk of associated with achieving our earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize our financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. While this were all able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines commodity prices to a reductions in our operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target. And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year and 80% of 2013.
We are confident that through controlled operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we'll remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."
267105,183645039,289701,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 10",1485,"Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever. Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity site of over 90% in both our works and Manchester power stations achieve record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 in our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activity which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over at 98% complete at the end of the first quarter. 2 major milestones were reached by the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and writer applications for the Warren County Power Station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The 3-on-1 combined cycle units will produce over 1,300-megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is schedule for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers. The company advanced plants for another 1,300-megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in the plan Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing ore units are necessitated by the half smack rolled issued by EPA last December. The projected end service state is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and were also offered significant value to customers.
Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines for Mitsubishi heavy industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering and construction began expect to file the CPCN and our writer applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year. 
Also in March, the Commission approve the applications for the conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin while the commercial operating is anticipated prior to the end of 2013. Dominion has identified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the offer Virginia coast in an area 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.
Our growth projects for our electric transmission continues to move forward. The rebuild of the Mount Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that it would take the line out of service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycle and should advance the projected closing of the project for mid-2013 to the end of 2014.
Mount Storm-to-Doubs is just a one of the many growth charges in various stages at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancement to at least the end of the decade. 
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. Court approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the to-Craig project was received in third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November. 
Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in the service by this December. Even with the depressed natural gas prices, we remained confident that wet gas line from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rates from dry to wet shale plays to capture the outlook from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.
We are in discussions with multiple provisions for bonuses for the possible construction of Phase II of Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We're pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project at the end of March we signed binding proceeding agreements with 2 companies 1 of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.
We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25 year term to non-free-trade agreement country. By filing supports overly, the project will have many cost of economic benefit. And we're hopeful for the ROE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval to project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost assessment for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in service date in 2017. As with any project of this magnitude we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities at a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to fracking process in general. We have reviewed the various revelations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impact. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that involves Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years to an increase of nearly 4,000-megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.
New connection for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather adjusted sales for Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a stronger contributor to all growth. 
On a regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for the customers more than offsetting any writer related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission writer update which we're also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.
To further conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectations. We continue to move forward with our growth plan and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

So you can facility up to export and leave a quarter of Appalachian production left for domestic consumption. So you've got export $750 million a day through this building or customer if we want. So the shale is not that much larger. The economic study that we filed with the permit for the non-NAFTA countries shows enormous economic benefits to cover County, Maryland, all of Maryland, all of the Ohio basin, the Appalachian basin, the Ohio River basin that all will be, all of the job or tax revenues, it's many, many tens of millions of dollars. This project by itself will increase or help our balance of trade by couple of percentage point on an annual basis. So there are -- the economic argument are pretty straightforward and they're almost overwhelming. But it is beneficial to the United States, the region, Maryland, Carbon County to allow us to be built. So that's why we're confident that it will be approved. It doesn't hurt of course, to have a counter-party, at least a counter-party from Japan."

Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by",1242,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher contribution from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter. 
Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail. 
First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from whether, the mild weather had a $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.  Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. Helping to offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken early in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but the income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Fairless Works power station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.  For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes store replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates on approximately 50% of our 2013 needs. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.
In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. We were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels help validate our view on the value of the securities.
In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included less than $0.01 of weather help. While it is still early in the quarter, at least through the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. However, weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. But it's too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include, sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.
At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, to our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remained to 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.
As shown on Slide 8, since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. In addition to this we're able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines in commodity prices to reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target. 
And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year in 80% of 2013.  We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we'll remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever. 
Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity factor of over 90% and both our Fairless Works and Manchester power stations achieve record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 at our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activities which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning. 
The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 98% complete, excuse me, at the end of the first quarter. Two major milestones were reached on the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and Rider applications for the Warren County power station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The three-on-one combined cycle unit will produce over 1,300 megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers. 
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing ore units are necessitated by the HAP's MACT rule issued by EPA last December. The projected end service date is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and will also offer significant value to customers.
Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering procurement and construction bids and expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year. 
Also in March, the commission approved the applications for conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin with commercial ops anticipated prior to the end of 2013. 
Dominion has notified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the Virginia Coast in an area of 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.
Our growth projects for our electric transmission continue to move forward. The rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that when it takes the line out of the service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycle and should advance the projected closing of the project from mid-2015 to the end of 2014.
Mt. Storm-to-Doubs is just one of the many growth projects in various stages of development at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancements through at least the end of the decade. 
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. Court approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs project was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November. 
Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be in the service by this December. Even with depressed natural gas prices, we remain confident that wet gas lines from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rates from dry to wet shale plays to capture the uplift from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.
We are in discussions with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We're pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. At the end of March we signed binding precedent agreements with 2 companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned project capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons of land on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.
We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25 year term to non free trade agreement country. Our filing supports overly that the project will have many positive economic benefit and we're hopeful for DOE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval of the project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost assessment for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an end service date in 2017. 
As with any project of this magnitude, we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities on a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to frac-ing process in general. We have reviewed the various regulations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impact. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years to an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.
New connects for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter of 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather-adjusted sales for Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
On a regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for customers more than offsetting any Rider related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission Rider update which we also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.
To further conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectation. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

That's why we think it is attractive as it is. But it can't be used for both at the same time all the time. But there are -- there's 2 parts of the period, you can load and offload. At the pier, there's different pipes going out to the pier. There are multiple tanks. There is a vaporization facility. There will be a liquefaction facility. So the parties who will have these contacts will have -- certain of them will be allowed to import, certain of them will be allowed to export and we think you should be thinking about it that way rather than segmenting."

At that time, we're going to assess where we are. Now, I would say this though on a broader basis, if we were contemplating -- if we had been contemplating building a merchant nuclear power station, I think I would have been able to give you a much shorter answer to your question about North Anna 3. But we're not. We believe that it is best for our customers for the long-term to have a balanced fuel mix. And by long-term I'm talking over the next 50 or 60 years. Having 4 nuclear power stations in Virginia is one of the reasons why we have among the lowest rates in the United States, and among the lowest on the East Coast. So we think it's important to keep all that in context as you make those kind of decisions. I believe North Anna 3 will be built by our company I don't know what it will be in 2015 or 2018 or 2020, but we will. North Anna and surely its existing units will have to retire in 2030 through that decade and we're going to need to have additional power in the state to keep a balanced portfolio. So I would give you 2 different answers. One, if we're a merchant, I would have just said what's North Anna 3? I don't know what you're talking about. But we are not. We are in a regulated environment where it's important for our customers to have a balanced fuel mix."

267105,183645039,290698,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by",1241,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher contribution from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter. 
Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail. 
First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from whether, the mild weather had a $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.  Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. Helping to offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken early in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but the income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Fairless Works power station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.  For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes store replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates on approximately 50% of our 2013 needs. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.
In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. We were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels help validate our view on the value of the securities.
In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included less than $0.01 of weather help. While it is still early in the quarter, at least through the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. However, weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. But it's too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include, sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.
At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, to our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remains at 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.
As shown on Slide 8, since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Our business units were able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines in commodity prices to reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target. 
And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year and 80% of 2013.  We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 uni",1496,"Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever. 
Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity factor of over 90% and both our Fairless Works and Manchester power stations achieved record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 at our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activities which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning. 
The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 98% complete, excuse me, at the end of the first quarter. Two major milestones were reached on the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and Rider applications for the Warren County power station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The three-on-one combined cycle unit will produce over 1,300 megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers. 
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing oil units are necessitated by the HAP's MACT rule issued by EPA last December. The projected end service date is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and will also offer significant value to customers.
Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering procurement and construction bids and expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year. 
Also in March, the commission approved the applications for conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin with commercial ops anticipated prior to the end of 2013. 
Dominion has notified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the Virginia Coast in an area of 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.
Our growth projects for our electric transmission continue to move forward. The rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that when it takes the line out of the service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycles and should advance the projected closing of the project from mid-2015 to the end of 2014.
Mt. Storm-to-Doubs is just one of the many growth projects in various stages of development at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancements through at least the end of the decade. 
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. Court approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs project was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November. 
Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be into service by this December. Even with depressed natural gas prices, we remain confident that wet gas lines from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rates from dry to wet shale plays to capture the uplift from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.
We are in discussions with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We're pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. At the end of March we signed binding precedent agreements with 2 companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned project capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons of land on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.
We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25 year term to non free trade agreement country. Our filing supports overly that the project will have many positive economic benefit and we're hopeful for DOE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval of the project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost assessment for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an end service date in 2017. 
As with any project of this magnitude, we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities on a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to frac-ing process in general. We have reviewed the various regulations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impact. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years for an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.
New connects for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter of 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather-adjusted sales for Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
On the regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for customers more than offsetting any Rider related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission Rider update which we also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.
To further conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectation. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year.

I believe North Anna 3 will be built by our company I don't know what it will be in 2015 or 2018 or 2020, but we will. North Anna and surely its existing units will have to retire in 2030 through that decade and we're going to need to have additional power in the state to keep a balanced portfolio. So I would give you 2 different answers. One, if we're a merchant, I would have just said what's North Anna 3? I don't know what you're talking about. But we are not. We are in a regulated environment where it's important for our customers to have a balanced fuel mix."

267105,183645039,290807,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by",1241,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher contribution from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter. 
Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail. 
First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from whether, the mild weather had a $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.  Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. Helping to offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken early in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but the income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Fairless Works power station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.  For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes store replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates on approximately 50% of our 2013 needs. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.
In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. We were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels help validate our view on the value of the securities.
In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included less than $0.01 of weather help. While it is still early in the quarter, at least through the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. However, weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. But it's too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include, sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.
At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, to our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remains at 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.
As shown on Slide 8, since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Our business units were able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines in commodity prices to reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target. 
And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year and 80% of 2013.  We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 uni",1496,"Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever. 
Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity factor of over 90% and both our Fairless Works and Manchester power stations achieved record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 at our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activities which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning. 
The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 98% complete, excuse me, at the end of the first quarter. Two major milestones were reached on the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and Rider applications for the Warren County power station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The three-on-one combined cycle unit will produce over 1,300 megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers. 
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing oil units are necessitated by the HAP's MACT rule issued by EPA last December. The projected end service date is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and will also offer significant value to customers.
Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering procurement and construction bids and expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year. 
Also in March, the commission approved the applications for conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin with commercial ops anticipated prior to the end of 2013. 
Dominion has notified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the Virginia Coast in an area of 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.
Our growth projects for our electric transmission continue to move forward. The rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that when it takes the line out of the service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycles and should advance the projected closing of the project from mid-2015 to the end of 2014.
Mt. Storm-to-Doubs is just one of the many growth projects in various stages of development at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancements through at least the end of the decade. 
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. Court approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs project was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November. 
Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be into service by this December. Even with depressed natural gas prices, we remain confident that wet gas lines from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rates from dry to wet shale plays to capture the uplift from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.
We are in discussions with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We're pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. At the end of March we signed binding precedent agreements with 2 companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned project capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons of land on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.
We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25 year term to non free trade agreement country. Our filing supports overly that the project will have many positive economic benefit and we're hopeful for DOE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval of the project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost assessment for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an end service date in 2017. 
As with any project of this magnitude, we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities on a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to frac-ing process in general. We have reviewed the various regulations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impact. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years for an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.
New connects for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter of 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather-adjusted sales for Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
On the regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for customers more than offsetting any Rider related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission Rider update which we also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.
To further conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectation. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

As far as overall, I think there are 13 or 14, I think, the number has grown to, permits that people are seeking. And it sort of reminds me of what's going on in the late 90s about how many people were going to build gas fire for our power plants all over in the United States. And then later about how many people were going to build import facilities all over the United States. And there were many, many announcements made, many, many, many permits sought and a handful actually happened. So I don't really know, Paul, 4, 5, 6 billion a day maybe would be allowed to be exported or could actually come to -- whether allowed or not, actually built, fully built.

So you've got -- then we'll export $750 million a day through this facility, for our customer if we want. So there is an abundance of gas in the region. Shale has made that much larger.

But we're not. We believe that it is best for our customers for the long-term to have a balanced fuel mix. And by long-term I'm talking over the next 50 or 60 years. Having 4 nuclear power stations in Virginia is one of the reasons why we have among the lowest rates in the United States, and among the lowest on the East Coast. So we think it's important to keep all that in context as you make those kind of decisions. I believe North Anna 3 will be built by our company I don't know what it will be in 2015 or 2018 or 2020, but we will. North Anna and surely its existing units will have to retire in 2030 through that decade and we're going to need to have additional power in the state to keep a balanced portfolio. So I would give you 2 different answers. One, if we're a merchant, I would have just said what's North Anna 3? I don't know what you're talking about. But we are not.

We've had a very cooperative relationship with the Sierra Club all through that time. We've been very good partners with each other. We hope to continue to be, as we move into the liquefaction. I'll let them speak for themselves but the agreement allows us to use the existing footprint and we're repairing on LNG operations to perform liquefaction exercises and to deliver liquefied natural gas for the terminal. I don't think there's really a lot of confusion about it. It's pretty clear in black and white. I'll let them speak for themselves. We would much rather as we do with all stake holders in which we're going to have an impact. We like to work out cooperative arrangements. We always have with the Sierra Club. We hope that we can as we go along here but we have the right to build it and we're going to proceed accordingly."

267105,183645039,324801,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by",1241,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher contribution from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter. 
Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail. 
First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from weather, the mild weather had a $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.  Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. Helping to offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken early in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Fairless Works power station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.  For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates on approximately 50% of our 2013 needs. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.
In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. We were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels help validate our view on the value of the securities.
In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included less than $0.01 of weather help. While it is still early in the quarter, at least through the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. However, weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. So it is too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include: sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins. 
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.
At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, to our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remains at 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.
As shown on Slide 8, since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets. 
So let me summarize my financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Our business units were able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target. 
And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year and 80% of 2013.  We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 uni",1490,"Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever. 
Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity factor of over 90% and both our Fairless Works and Manchester power stations achieved record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 at our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activities which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning. 
The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 98% complete at the end of the first quarter. Two major milestones were reached on the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and Rider applications for the Warren County power station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The three-on-one combined cycle unit will produce over 1,300 megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers. 
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing oil units are necessitated by the HAP's MACT rule issued by EPA last December. The projected in-service date is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and will also offer significant value to customers.
Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering procurement and construction bids and expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year. 
Also in March, the commission approved the applications for conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin with commercial ops anticipated prior to the end of 2013. 
Dominion has notified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the Virginia Coast in an area of 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.
Our growth projects for our electric transmission continue to move forward. The rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that when it takes the line out of service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycles and should advance the projected closing of the project from mid-2015 to the end of 2014.
Mt. Storm-to-Doubs is just one of the many growth projects in various stages of development at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancements through at least the end of the decade. 
Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs project was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November. 
Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be into service by this December. Even with depressed natural gas prices, we remain confident that wet gas lines from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rigs from dry to wet shale plays to capture the uplift from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.
We are in discussions with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We are pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. At the end of March we signed binding precedent agreements with 2 companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned project capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.
We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25-year term to non-free-trade agreement country. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefit and we are hopeful for DOE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval of the project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost estimate for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in-service date in 2017.
As with any project of this magnitude, we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities on a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to frac-ing process in general. We have reviewed the various regulations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impacts. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years for an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.
New connects for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter of 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather-adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. 
On the regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for customers more than offsetting any Rider-related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission Rider update which we also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectation. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. 
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

So as we work through the course of this time, you'll see that portion of the contract will be used for export. It's too early -- we're not at a point where we're going to start talking about what the earnings profile is from this facility because as of today we still haven't locked down the cost, financing, exact timing. It's not, when you look across our website and look at what our 5-year growth plan is and the growth CapEx, it still shows nothing related to Cove Point's liquefaction facility.

And so the bad debt level got lower, that's passed on to customers, but your revenue stream also was reduced, so it's a net 0. So if you look at the quarter, really quarter-over-quarter, operating expenses were down about $0.04 or about $37 million, which was very positive for us.

But we're not. We believe that it is best for our customers for the long term to have a balanced fuel mix. And by long term, I'm talking over the next 50 or 60 years. Having 4 nuclear power stations in Virginia is one of the reasons why we have among the lowest rates in the United States, and among the lowest on the East Coast. So we think it's important to keep all that in context as you make those kind of decisions. I believe North Anna 3 will be built by our company. I don't know if it will be in 2015 or 2018 or 2020. But we will -- North Anna and Surry's existing units will have to retire in 2030 through that decade. And we're going to need to have nuclear power in the state to keep a balanced portfolio.

Those measures include our first quarter 2012 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2012, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 in pages 34 to 40 in our earnings release kit.
Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter, as well as our guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Tom will update our operating and regulatory activities, as well as review the progress we have made on our growth plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick."
267105,214009403,336401,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 pe",1219,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 per share when compared to normal. Recall that in the first quarter, mild weather reduced operating earnings by $0.11 per share. So for the first 6 months of 2012, mild weather has reduced our earnings by a total of $92 million or $0.16 per share compared to normal. 
There are 2 other items I would like to highlight in our second quarter operating earnings. First, the unregulated retail business had a very strong quarter, with results about $0.05 better than expectations. This was driven by $0.02 of better margins and a $0.03 gain on some mark-to-market contracts that will roll off largely over the next 12 months. Secondly, we've excluded $74 million from pretax operating earnings from major storm cost related to the late June storm activity that resulted in over $1 million of our customers being without power. While restoration activity continued into July, we recognized the entire estimated cost to restore service in the second quarter, consistent with our accounting for past major storm events. Tom will provide more operating details on the storm later in the call. GAAP earnings were $0.45 per share in the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the quarter were the cost related to the late June storm activity and charges related to some of our merchant generation plants, which have been or are in the process of being sold. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $282 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by stronger than expected results at Dominion Retail. Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $186 million, which was at the midpoint of its guidance range. Results from Producer Services were below expectations given the overall weakness in the natural gas markets but were offset by lower O&M expenses. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $312 million for the second quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower ancillary service revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses. Year to date across our businesses, we reduced operating and maintenance expenses by the equivalent of $0.08 per share, more than offsetting the headwinds from lower commodity prices. On a consolidated basis interest expenses came in as expected, income taxes were below our estimates. State tax benefits, as well as resolution of some IRS audit issues help reduced our overall effective income tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 35.5% to 36.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.74 billion for the first half of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper and Letters of Credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and demand and when netted against short-term cash and investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion, and $2 billion of debt this year, with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of $1.5 billion of maturing debt. We have already locked in Treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have now hedged most of our anticipated 2013 need as well. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the third quarter within a range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.95 per share for the third quarter of 2011, which included about $0.06 per share of weather help. Compared to third quarter of last year, positive drivers for the third quarter include sales growth at Virginia Power, higher writer revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather and a lower merchant generation margin.
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the full year, we would expect earnings to fall within a range of $3.20 to $3.25 per share, or 5% to 6% above original operating earnings for 2011. I mentioned earlier that mild weather in the first half of the year has reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share. However, weather in the month of July was a little better than normal and a hot August and September can reduce some of the full year weather impact as well. We will discuss our range in more detailed on our third quarter call after we see the summer results. As a reminder, our growth plan is predicated on normal weather and you can expect our guidance for future years to be based on 5% to 6% above weather normalized earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge position at Page 29 of our earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we've added to our hedges at breakpoint for 2013. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is still only $0.05 per share. As shown on the Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significant above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the second quarter were near the midpoint of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.05 per share compared to normal. We've excluded $0.08 per share from operating earnings due to the significant June storm activity. We are able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by the decline in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is $0.90 to $1 per share. Our annual operating guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we've locked in all of our anticipated merchant margins for 2013. We are confident that control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest-rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our weather normalized growth targets. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

More than 1 million of",1417,"Good morning. What has been a particularly mild weather year in Virginia changed quickly in late June when a series of powerful storms with winds in excess of 80 miles per hour move through the state in northeastern North Carolina. More than 1 million of our customers lost power, making it the third largest storm event in the company's history behind only Hurricane Isabel and Irene. Our employees with help from utilities as far away from Florida and Quebec conducted a multi-day restoration effort in 100-plus degree weather. On behalf of our customers and our shareholders, I offer them thanks and I also thank our customers for there patience and understanding. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. The year-to-date net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages was 100%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the first half of the year was an impressive 93%. State Line Power Station was shutdown in late March. On June 26, we sold the plant to BTU Solutions, a company that provides demolition services for generation facilities. On June 29, we executed an agreement to sell the sale on Harbor Power Station to Footprint Power who will operate the station until it is removed from service in June of 2014. Footprint is planning to re-purpose the site including the potential development of a natural gas fired power station. Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on budget and on schedule following 4 years of construction. Virginia City is one of the cleanest, if not the cleanest, coal-fired power stations in the country and it may well be one of the last to be built in the United States given recent EPA regulations. The groundbreaking for the 1,329-megawatt Warren County three-on-one cycle plant occurred on May 31. Procurement of equipment and materials is about 50% complete and foundation work is well underway. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014. The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatts three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have cost similar to the Warren County plant. Both will offer significant value to customers. Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Power Systems of America for the Brunswick facility. We have signed a natural gas firm transformation proceeding agreement with Transco and have signed a fully wrapped engineering procurement and construction contract with Floor. We expect to file a CPC and writer applications with the State Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of this year. On May 22, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved the air permits for the company's conversion of the AltaVista, Southampton and Hopewell power stations for coal biomass allowing commencement of construction activities. Completion is expected in the second quarter of next year for AltaVista and the third quarter for the other 2 plans. Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. Construction of our Appalachian Gateway Project is nearly complete and the project should be in service, on schedule by next month. The Northeast Expansion project, as well as the Ellsberg project are expected to be in service this November. Construction is well underway on Phase I of the nature and processing plant and associated pipelines. We continue to work toward a December in service date. Producer activity remains robust in Ohio. 112 wells are drilled or are being drilled and 295 permits have been issued. This represents a 15% increase in both metrics since just last quarter. 
On June 11, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed House Bill 487, which provides regulatory certainty for existing dry gas gathering pipelines that are converted to wet gathering service. The bill allows Dominion East Ohio to exempt those converted facilities from future PUC rate regulation. In conjunction with previous Ohio legislation to exempt gathering investment from utility regulation, these provisions ensure that the company has an opportunity to earn predictable, sustainable returns on existing and new investments used to provide wet gathering service without incurring regulatory approval delays. We are currently working with multiple producers to reach agreements to gather their gas. In addition to gathering, we recently conducted a nonbinding open season to transport gas from the outlet of Ohio processing plants to interconnect with downstream international interstate pipelines. Multiple shippers displayed interest totaling 1.1 BCF per day. Investments to build facilities needed to support this activity will be better known once binding shipper commitments are reached. 
On our last earnings call, we announced that we were moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. In June, we requested and received approval to use the FERC prefiling process for environmental review. We expect the FERC certificate to be granted within 18 to 24 months. We also filed in Maryland State Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for October and we expect a decision later this year. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who last month filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. We're confident in our ability to construct and operate a liquefaction plant at Cove Point. We continue to make progress in our negotiations to reach terminal service agreements. Those agreements are expected to be finalized later this year. Front end engineering and design studies are progressing as well. We will provide a cost estimate for the project later this year as these studies become more defined. Subject to successful completion of the studies, execution of terminal services agreement and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017. As part of its ongoing business, Dominion Transmission recently extended a contract for 49 BCF of general storage service for a 10 year period at maximum tariff rates. This is an example of the continued strong demand for our gas storage services. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Weather adjusted sales increased 1.1% for the first quarter and 1% for the second quarter. New connects for the second quarter were well above last year's level and data center growth continues. In fact, new connects in the first half of 2012 are about 20% higher than the first 2 quarters of 2011. While we continued positive growth segments in our Virginia service territory, we now expect weather normalized sales growth for 2012 will be between 1% and 2% rather than our original estimate of 2% to 2.5%. On the regulatory front, at the end of the first quarter, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. We request for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of expected fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. The hearing will be held in October and we expect a decision by year end. Last month, reaps were filed in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal on the effective date for the Return on Equity established by the Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biannual review. The effective date issue will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September and we should get a final decision in November. The appeal will determine if the top end of the return on equity collar will be used for the biannual review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. On our last call, we indicated that Virginia Power's Return on Equity, computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate making, was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results for the entire first half of 2012, BAPCo similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 18 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biannual review is still less than 9%.
So to conclude, all of our 3 business units performed well and together delivered results but given the mild whether met our expectations. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings per share growth beginning this year. 
Thank you and we are now ready for your questions."

I think what you're referring to probably from the last review was the Early Retirement Program where they carried it over and part of it over the second biannual review. That was not completely out of line with prior, they've matched it to the retirement but the effect of that of course was to bring over $100 million of that BSP into the second biannual review. There won't be any discretionary issues around that. That cost is there according to the Commission's own rulings. So I think when you take a look at what we've been dealing with, I think all of these costs are appropriately included in the biannual review period. Their expense as they have been according to all Commission -- prior Commission President and I expect we'll see of course we don't know what we learn, we see how mobile over the next 2 quarters but that's where we stand today."

267105,214009403,336695,"Dominion Resources, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 pe",1223,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 per share when compared to normal. Recall that in the first quarter, mild weather reduced operating earnings by $0.11 per share; so for the first 6 months of 2012, mild weather has reduced our earnings by a total of $92 million or $0.16 per share compared to normal.
There are 2 other items I would like to highlight in our second quarter operating earnings. First, our unregulated retail business had a very strong quarter, with results about $0.05 better than expectations. This was driven by $0.02 of better margins and a $0.03 gain on some mark-to-market contracts that will roll off largely over the next 12 months. Secondly, we've excluded $74 million from pretax operating earnings from major storm costs related to the late June storm activity that resulted in over 1 million of our customers being without power. While restoration activity continued into July, we recognized the entire estimated cost to restore service in the second quarter, consistent with our accounting for past major storm events. Tom will provide more operating details on the storm later in the call.
GAAP earnings were $0.45 per share in the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the quarter were the costs related to the late June storm activity and charges related to some of our merchant generation plants, which have been or are in the process of being sold. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $282 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by stronger-than-expected results at Dominion Retail. Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $186 million, which was at the midpoint of its guidance range. Results from Producer Services were below expectations given the overall weakness in the natural gas markets but were offset by lower O&M expenses. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $312 million for the second quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower ancillary service revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses.
Year to date, across our businesses, we reduced operating and maintenance expenses by the equivalent of $0.08 per share, more than offsetting the headwinds from lower commodity prices. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in as expected. Money income taxes were below our estimates. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 35.5% to 36.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.74 billion for the first half of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion, and $2 billion of debt this year, with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion of maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have now hedged most of our anticipated 2013 need as well. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the third quarter within a range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.95 per share for the third quarter of 2011, which included about $0.06 per share of weather help. Compared to the third quarter of last year, positive drivers for the third quarter include sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather and a lower merchant generation margin.
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the full year, we would expect earnings to fall within a range of $3.20 to $3.25 per share or about 5% to 6% above original operating earnings for 2011. I mentioned earlier that mild weather in the first half of the year has reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share. However, weather in the month of July was a little better than normal, and a hot August and September can reduce some of the full year weather impact as well. We will discuss our range in more detail on our third quarter call after we see the summer results.
As a reminder, our growth plan is predicated on normal weather, and you can expect our guidance for future years to be based on 5% to 6% above weather normalized earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge position at Page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we've added to our hedges at Brayton Point for 2013. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is still only $0.05 per share.
As shown on the Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the second quarter were near the midpoint of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.05 per share compared to normal. We've excluded $0.08 per share from operating earnings due to the significant June storm activity. We are able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by the declines in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is $0.90 to $1 per share. Our annual operating guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we've locked in nearly all of our anticipated merchant margins for 2013. We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our weather normalized growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

What had been a particularly mild weather year in Virginia changed quickly in late June when a series of powerful storms with winds in excess of 80 miles per hour moved through the state in Northeastern North Carolina. More than 1 million of our customers lost power, making it the third largest storm event in the company's history behind only Hurricane Isabel and Irene. Our employees with help from utilities as far away as Florida and Quebec conducted a multi-day restoration effort in 100-plus degree weather. On behalf of our customers and our shareholders, I offer them thanks, and I also thank our customers for their patience and understanding.
Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 100%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the first half of the year was an impressive 93%.
State Line Power Station was shutdown in late March. On June 26, we sold the plant to BTU Solutions, a company that provides demolition services for generation facilities. On June 29, we executed an agreement to sell the Salem Harbor Power Station to Footprint Power who will operate the station until it is removed from service in June of 2014. Footprint is planning to re-purpose the site including the potential development of a natural-gas-fired power station.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on budget and on schedule, following 4 years of construction. Virginia City is one of the cleanest, if not, the cleanest coal-fired power stations in the country, and it may well be one of the last to be built in the United States given recent EPA regulations. The groundbreaking for the 1,329-megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant occurred on May 31. Procurement of equipment and materials is about 50% complete, and foundation work is well underway. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014.
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. Both will offer significant value to customers. Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Power Systems of America for the Brunswick facility. We have signed a natural gas firm transportation precedent agreement with Transco and have signed a fully wrapped engineering procurement and construction contract with Fluor. We expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of this year.
On May 22, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved the air permits for the company's conversion of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass, allowing commencement of construction activities. Completion is expected in the second quarter of next year for Altavista and the third quarter for the other 2 plants.
Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. Construction of our Appalachian Gateway Project is nearly complete, and the project should be in service on schedule by next month. The Northeast Expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs Project are expected to be in service this November. Construction is well underway on Phase I of the nature and processing plant and associated pipelines. We continue to work toward a December in-service date. Producer activity remains robust in Ohio. 112 wells are drilled or are being drilled, and 295 permits have been issued. This represents a 15% increase in both metrics since just last quarter.
On June 11, Ohio Governor, John Kasich, signed House Bill 487, which provides regulatory certainty for existing dry gas gathering pipelines that are converted to wet gathering service. The bill allows Dominion East Ohio to exempt those converted facilities from future PUC rate regulation. In conjunction with previous Ohio legislation to exempt new gathering investments from utility regulation, these provisions ensure that the company has an opportunity to earn predictable, sustainable returns on existing and new investments used to provide wet gathering service without incurring regulatory approval delays. We are currently working with multiple producers to reach agreements to gather their gas. In addition to gathering, we recently conducted a nonbinding open season to transport gas from the outlet of Ohio processing plants to interconnect with downstream interstate pipelines. Multiple shippers displayed interest totaling over 1.1 Bcf per day. Investments to build the facilities needed to support this activity will be better known once binding shipper commitments are reached.
On our last earnings call, we announced that we were moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. In June, we requested and received approval to use the FERC prefiling process for environmental review. We expect the FERC certificate to be granted within 18 to 24 months. We also filed in Maryland State Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for October, and we expect a decision later this year. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who, last month, filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. We're confident in our ability to construct and operate a liquefaction plant at Cove Point. We continue to make progress on our negotiations to reach terminal service agreements. Those agreements are expected to be finalized later this year.
Front-end engineering and design studies are progressing as well. We will provide a cost estimate for the project later this year as those studies become more defined. Subject to successful completion of the studies, execution of terminal services agreement and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017.
As part of its ongoing business, Dominion Transmission recently extended a contract for 49 Bcf of general storage service for a 10-year period at maximum tariff rates. This is an example of a continued strong demand for our gas storage services.
Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Weather adjusted sales increased 1.1% for the first quarter and 1% for the second quarter. New connects for the second quarter were well above last year's level, and data center growth continues. In fact, new connects in the first half of 2012 are about 20% higher than the first 2 quarters of 2011. While we see continued positive growth signals in our Virginia service territory, we now expect that weather normalized sales growth for 2012 will be between 1% and 2% rather than our original estimate of 2% to 2.5%.
On the regulatory front, at the end of the first quarter, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of expected fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. The hearing will be held in October, and we expect the decision by year end.
Last month, briefs were filed in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by the Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biennial review. The effective date issue will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September, and we should get a final decision in November. The appeal will determine if the top end of the return on equity collar will be used for the biennial review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. On our last call, we indicated that Virginia Power's return on equity, computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate making, was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results for the entire first half of 2012, VEPCO's similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 18 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biennial review is still less than 9%.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results but given the mild whether, met our expectations. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings per share growth beginning this year.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

And that's -- there won't be any discretionary issues around that. That cost is there according to the commission's own rulings.

So first of all, we think there's certainly a very good chance that prices will continue to improve '14 and beyond. But in addition to that, we will continue to look at, as we did in '13, in interest rate environment where we can protect ourselves with low interest rates through hedges in the out years to give us some help versus what we might be thinking about today. We're also continuing to look at expenses, which a lot of folks asked us early in the year whether we could offset the commodity headwinds in '12 with reduced O&M expenses. I think if you look at the first 2 quarters and what we expect the rest of the year, we've been able to do that. So we have a number of things that we're looking at for '14 and beyond, but again, if you look at power prices alone, they've improved dramatically just in several months, and we would hope they continue to improve."

I think that shows us that developers and homebuilders are getting back out. They're turning dirt, and we're starting to see that activity in the form of new connects. Now it does take some time for new connect demand growth to really show up in our numbers, but that's a good early indicator. Generally speaking, the industrial loads are all looking strong. We've had some consolidations of industrial customers here in our service territory, but the overall economic strength is very good. I would say if you look for where there's some softness in our numbers, it's probably widely distributed among kind of the commercial sector. And I don't think that it's coming as any real surprise given the overall economy throughout the country. But it's really distributed among a lot of various types of commercial accounts, whether it's laundromats or whether it's welding shops, those type of places. But we expect when the economy strengthens that, that's going to come back very well. So I'm seeing good early strong indicators, industrial growth, the data centers still connecting. Just attended grand opening of a new data center yesterday. We plan to connect 9 this year. That's still on pace, so as I look at things going forward, we have a strong economy. It's widely distributed, and all the areas are really doing pretty well."

Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 pe",1223,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 per share when compared to normal. Recall that in the first quarter, mild weather reduced operating earnings by $0.11 per share; so for the first 6 months of 2012, mild weather has reduced our earnings by a total of $92 million or $0.16 per share compared to normal.
There are 2 other items I would like to highlight in our second quarter operating earnings. First, our unregulated retail business had a very strong quarter, with results about $0.05 better than expectations. This was driven by $0.02 of better margins and a $0.03 gain on some mark-to-market contracts that will roll off largely over the next 12 months. Secondly, we've excluded $74 million from pretax operating earnings from major storm costs related to the late June storm activity that resulted in over 1 million of our customers being without power. While restoration activity continued into July, we recognized the entire estimated cost to restore service in the second quarter, consistent with our accounting for past major storm events. Tom will provide more operating details on the storm later in the call.
GAAP earnings were $0.45 per share in the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the quarter were the costs related to the late June storm activity and charges related to some of our merchant generation plants, which have been or are in the process of being sold. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $282 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by stronger-than-expected results at Dominion Retail. Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $186 million, which was at the midpoint of its guidance range. Results from Producer Services were below expectations given the overall weakness in the natural gas markets but were offset by lower O&M expenses. Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $312 million for the second quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower ancillary service revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses.
Year to date, across our businesses, we reduced operating and maintenance expenses by the equivalent of $0.08 per share, more than offsetting the headwinds from lower commodity prices. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in as expected. Money income taxes were below our estimates. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 35.5% to 36.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.74 billion for the first half of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion of maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have now hedged most of our anticipated 2013 need as well. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the third quarter within a range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.95 per share for the third quarter of 2011, which included about $0.06 per share of weather help. Compared to the third quarter of last year, positive drivers for the third quarter include sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather and a lower merchant generation margin.
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the full year, we would expect earnings to fall within a range of $3.20 to $3.25 per share or about 5% to 6% above original operating earnings for 2011. I mentioned earlier that mild weather in the first half of the year has reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share. However, weather in the month of July was a little better than normal, and a hot August and September can reduce some of the full year weather impact as well. We will discuss our range in more detail on our third quarter call after we see the summer results.
As a reminder, our growth plan is predicated on normal weather, and you can expect our guidance for future years to be based on 5% to 6% above weather normalized earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge position on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we've added to our hedges at Brayton Point for 2013. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is still only $0.05 per share.
As shown on the Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the second quarter were near the midpoint of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.05 per share compared to normal. We've excluded $0.08 per share from operating earnings due to the significant June storm activity. We are able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by the declines in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is $0.90 to $1 per share. Our annual operating guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we've locked in nearly all of our anticipated merchant margins for 2013. We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our weather normalized growth targets.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

What has been a particularly mild weather year in Virginia changed quickly in late June when a series of powerful storms with winds in excess of 80 miles per hour moved through the state and Northeastern North Carolina. More than 1 million of our customers lost power, making it the third largest storm event in the company's history behind only Hurricanes Isabel and Irene. Our employees with help from utilities as far away as Florida and Quebec conducted a multi-day restoration effort in 100-plus degree weather. On behalf of our customers and our shareholders, I offer them thanks, and I also thank our customers for their patience and understanding.
Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 100%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the first half of the year was an impressive 93%.
State Line Power Station was shutdown in late March. On June 26, we sold the plant to BTU Solutions, a company that provides demolition services for generation facilities. On June 29, we executed an agreement to sell the Salem Harbor Power Station to Footprint Power who will operate the station until it is removed from service in June of 2014. Footprint is planning to re-purpose the site including the potential development of a natural-gas-fired power station.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on budget and on schedule, following 4 years of construction. Virginia City is one of the cleanest, if not, the cleanest coal-fired power stations in the country, and it may well be one of the last to be built in the United States given recent EPA regulations. The groundbreaking for the 1,329-megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant occurred on May 31. Procurement of equipment and materials is about 50% complete, and foundation work is well underway. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014.
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. Both will offer significant value to customers. Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Power Systems of America for the Brunswick facility. We have signed a natural gas firm transportation precedent agreement with Transco and have signed a fully wrapped engineering procurement and construction contract with Fluor. We expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of this year.
On May 22, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved the air permits for the company's conversion of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass, allowing commencement of construction activities. Completion is expected in the second quarter of next year for Altavista and the third quarter for the other 2 plants.
Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. Construction of our Appalachian Gateway Project is nearly complete, and the project should be in service on schedule by next month. The Northeast Expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs Project are expected to be in service this November. Construction is well underway on Phase I of the nature and processing plant and associated pipelines. We continue to work toward a December in-service date. Producer activity remains robust in Ohio. 112 wells are drilled or are being drilled, and 295 permits have been issued. This represents a 15% increase in both metrics since just last quarter.
On June 11, Ohio Governor, John Kasich, signed House Bill 487, which provides regulatory certainty for existing dry gas gathering pipelines that are converted to wet gathering service. The bill allows Dominion East Ohio to exempt those converted facilities from future PUC rate regulation. In conjunction with previous Ohio legislation to exempt new gathering investments from utility regulation, these provisions ensure that the company has an opportunity to earn predictable, sustainable returns on existing and new investments used to provide wet gathering service without incurring regulatory approval delays. We are currently working with multiple producers to reach agreements to gather their gas. In addition to gathering, we recently conducted a nonbinding open season to transport gas from the outlet of Ohio processing plants to interconnect with downstream interstate pipelines. Multiple shippers displayed interest totaling over 1.1 Bcf per day. Investments to build the facilities needed to support this activity will be better known once binding shipper commitments are reached.
On our last earnings call, we announced that we were moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. In June, we requested and received approval to use the FERC prefiling process for environmental review. We expect the FERC certificate to be granted within 18 to 24 months. We also filed in Maryland State Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for October, and we expect a decision later this year. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who, last month, filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. We're confident in our ability to construct and operate a liquefaction plant at Cove Point. We continue to make progress on our negotiations to reach terminal service agreements. Those agreements are expected to be finalized later this year.
Front-end engineering and design studies are progressing as well. We will provide a cost estimate for the project later this year as those studies become more defined. Subject to successful completion of the studies, execution of terminal services agreement and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017.
As part of its ongoing business, Dominion Transmission recently extended a contract for 49 Bcf of general storage service for a 10-year period at maximum tariff rates. This is an example of a continued strong demand for our gas storage services.
Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Weather adjusted sales increased 1.1% for the first quarter and 1% for the second quarter. New connects for the second quarter were well above last year's level, and data center growth continues. In fact, new connects in the first half of 2012 are about 20% higher than the first 2 quarters of 2011. While we see continued positive growth signals in our Virginia service territory, we now expect that weather normalized sales growth for 2012 will be between 1% and 2% rather than our original estimate of 2% to 2.5%.
On the regulatory front, at the end of the first quarter, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of expected fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. The hearing will be held in October, and we expect the decision by year end.
Last month, briefs were filed in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by the Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biennial review. The effective date issued will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September, and we should get a final decision in November. The appeal will determine if the top end of the return on equity collar will be used for the biennial review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. On our last call, we indicated that Virginia Power's return on equity, computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate making, was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results for the entire first half of 2012, VEPCO's similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 18 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biennial review is still less than 9%.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results but given the mild weather, met our expectations. We continue to move forward with our growth plan and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings per share growth beginning this year.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

And that's -- there won't be any discretionary issues around that. That cost is there according to the commission's own rulings.

First, if you look at our hedge slide, I think it's on Page 9 in the deck, if you go back just one quarter and reference what '14 look like, I believe the hedge market position at that point was about $40 and some change. We show $42 here just in 3 months. If you look at the market forward price for '14 as of yesterday, it was almost $43. So this price has moved up in just 3 to 4 months by 6% or 7%, and we're well over 1.5 years away from a '14 midpoint number. So first of all, we think there's certainly a very good chance that prices will continue to improve '14 and beyond. But in addition to that, we will continue to look at, as we did in '13, in interest rate environment where we can protect ourselves with low interest rates through hedges in the out years to give us some help versus what we might be thinking about today. We're also continuing to look at expenses, which a lot of folks asked us early in the year whether we could offset the commodity headwinds in '12 with reduced O&M expenses. I think if you look at the first 2 quarters and what we expect the rest of the year, we've been able to do that. So we have a number of things that we're looking at for '14 and beyond, but again, if you look at power prices alone, they've improved dramatically just in several months, and we would hope they continue to improve."

Now it does take some time for new connect demand growth to really show up in our numbers, but that's a good early indicator. Generally speaking, the industrial loads are all looking strong. We've had some consolidations of industrial customers here in our service territory, but the overall economic strength is very good. I would say if you look for where there's some softness in our numbers, it's probably widely distributed among kind of the commercial sector. And I don't think that is coming as any real surprise given the overall economy throughout the country. But it's really distributed among a lot of various types of commercial accounts, whether it's laundromats or whether it's welding shops, those type of places. But we expect when the economy strengthens that, that's going to come back very well. So seeing good early strong indicators, industrial growth, the data centers still connecting. Just attended grand opening of a new data center yesterday. We plan to connect 9 this year. That's still on pace, so as I look at things going forward, we have a strong economy.

Dominion's 2012 third quarter operating earnings were $0.92 per share, toward the bottom of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share wh",1466,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 third quarter operating earnings were $0.92 per share, toward the bottom of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share when compared to normal. While temperatures as measured by degree days were above normal, other factors impacting weather-related demand, low humidity offset higher temperatures. While the degree days were above normal in July, they were close to normal in August and below normal in September. Additionally, the highest temperatures during the quarter occurred in the aftermath of the Draco storm in early July, over 1.2 million of our customers lost power. Restorations took nearly a week, which prevented us from benefiting from the extreme weather. 
In the first 9 months of 2012, mild weather conditions have reduced earnings by a total of $0.17 per share compared to normal. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on the results for the quarter. Particular factors in the quarter relative to the midpoint of our guidance range where a storm related outage at our Hastings planned, an unplanned outage at Millstone and water temperature limitations that required us to remove Unit 2 from service for almost 2 weeks. Earnings for GAAP purposes were $0.36 per share in the third quarter. Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close the Kewaunee nuclear plant with the associated write-down of the investment in that plan. This was the principal factor for the lower GAAP earnings for the quarter. 
Other differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the results related to the breaking point in and Elwood power stations that we are in the process of selling. Consistent with our treatment of previous transactions, results for these assets were excluded from operating earnings as of this quarter. Reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings will be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power EBIT for the third quarter was $242 million, which was just below the midpoint of its guidance range. Lower than expected results at Dominion Retail, due to mark-to-market changes, partially offset the lower than expected storm costs and lower operating expenses. 
Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $178 million, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. The storm had a negative impact on operations at our Hastings Processing Plant. This unit was off-line due to a loss of off-site power for several days, which impacted processing volumes and income. The overall weakness in the storage and gas transportation markets also impacted results, both the Gas Transmission and Producer Services businesses. 
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $617 million for the third quarter, which was also below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower ancillary service revenues and higher operating expenses were the principal factors driving the results for the regulated generation business. 
The merchant business, the millstone outage I referred to earlier is the principal driver for lower merchant generation contributions. 
On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes came in better than our estimates. Consistent with past practices, interest expenses associated with the merchant plants are now being sold and have been excluded from operating earnings. Tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues, have reduced our overall effective income tax rate to 35% for the quarter compared to our guidance range of 36.5% to 37%. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be about 35% to 35.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first 9 months of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. During the quarter, we extended the term of these credit facilities by an additional year to September 2017. Commercial paper and Letters of Credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.4 billion, and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We issued slightly more than $1 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes for the parent company in September. We were pleased with the market response to our offering and thank those of you who participated. 
We had planned to issue an additional $750 million of Virginia Power debt in the fourth quarter but decided to push that issue into 2013  based on current cash projections. We have already locked in Treasury rates with hedges for a substantial portion for anticipated 2013 debt needs and have begun to lock in rates for 2014 needs as well. 
As part of our 2012 and 2013 financing plans, we will issue new shares of common stock through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity in each of those years.
The expected proceeds from the sale of the 3 merchant power stations will be sufficient to offset any need for market equity in 2013, as well as reduce some of our debt need.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter within a range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011, which included about $0.08 per share of weather hurt. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, positive drivers for the quarter include the return to normal weather, earnings from our newly completed growth projects at Dominion Energy, sales growth at Virginia Power and higher Rider related revenues from our generation growth projects. Negative drivers for the quarter include lower merchant generation margins and a higher effective tax rate. The operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 has been $3.10 to $3.35 per share. With normal weather, our year-to-date operating earnings would have been $2.53 per share rather than the $2.36 per share we have reported. And in the middle of our fourth quarter guidance range, we have reported year-to-date operating earnings result in a full year operating earnings that will be below bottom of our guidance range. Therefore, absent a cold fourth quarter, it will be difficult for us to achieve full year results that are within that range. However, when adjusted for weather, we expect earnings in the middle of our guidance range, which is 5% to 6% above the $3.05 per share we earned in 2011. Last month, we issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20, $3.50 per share. Middle of this range assumes normal weather, corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase in the middle of our guidance range for 2012. Therefore, the weather hurt we have experienced in 2012 would have no impact on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. The decision to sell the breaking point in Kincaid Power Stations and our 50% interest in the Elwood Power Station will no longer include these positions in our hedge disclosure. Since our last earnings call, we have had made no changes to our hedge position to Millstone. Sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices for the remainder of 2012 was less than $0.01 per share. Sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only about $0.025 per share. 
As shown on Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
Now let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the third quarter were toward the bottom of our guidance range. For interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate, a positive impact and results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to midpoint of the guidance range were mild weather, our operating expenses and unplanned outages at Hastings and Millstone. 
Operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We expect weather normalized earnings for 2012 to be in the middle of our original guidance range and consistent with our 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings growth target. 
Finally, we have issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase in the middle of our guidance range for 2012. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Year-to-date net capacity factors of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 99%. Including the 3 refueling outages, net capacity factor for the first 9 months of 2012 was an impressive 95%. 
Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close and decommission the Kewaunee nuclear power station. Last year, we announced our intention to sell the facility because it no longer fit strategically to our merchant portfolio. However, we were unable to find a buyer for Kewaunee. We expect to cease power production in the second quarter of next year and move shut down. Decommissioning obligation is fully funded. Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on budget and on schedule following 4 years of construction. 
During the third quarter, significant progress was made toward biomass commissioning, which should be completed during the fourth quarter. Construction activities are progressing for the 1,329 megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plants. EPC contractor has poured the foundation for the major equipment components. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014 and is on time and on budget. 
The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. We have made progress with equipment procurement, supply agreements and permitting is underway. 
In July 31, Dominion executed the EPC contract with floor and issued a limited notice to proceed. We expect to file a CPCN and Rider application with Virginia commission next month. 
The projects to convert the AltaVista, Southhampton and Hopewell power stations from cold to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. Engineering is 95% complete, and the 3 projects are expected to reach commercial operations prior to the end of next year. The company is proposing to modify the existing Primeau PowerStation units 3 and 4 by converting them to use natural gas instead of coal. A minor air permit modification has been submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality and the fixed-price EPC contract for this work has been awarded. CPC on the application was filed with the State Corporation Commission in August. 
Pending the receipt of the required approvals, the station will commence operations on natural gas beginning in the summer of 2014. Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. Gateway project was placed into service on September 1, on-time and below budget. the pipeline expansion will relieve congestion in the region allowing natural gas production to move to market. 
Both the Northeast Expansion and the Ellisburg to Craigs Project are expected to be in service next week, on-time and on budget. 
Relevant to the Utica Shale formation is proceeding as demonstrated by the leading indicators of enough well permits and building activity. In early October, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had issued 413 horizontal well permits to multiple producers with 176 wells drilled today. 35 of those wells are now producing. 24 rigs are currently on location in Ohio. Many continues to leverage our Ohio and West Virginia infrastructure in support of this rapidly growing energy supply. Construction of nature and Phase I is moving forward. The inlet, outlet and product lines are expected to be complete in November. 
All major equipment, tiers and towers have been set and piping and electrical work has been progressing well. Over 900 workers are on-site working 2 shifts to make the late December in-service date. 
As noted in our last earnings call, recent legislation paved the way for Dominion East Ohio to construct new gathering facilities and to convert existing strategically located pipelines to let gathering service outside of the utility rate regulation. Building on that framework, we've entered into several gathering and processing agreements to date, and we continue to negotiate with many producers in midstream developers. And as disclosed last quarter, Dominion East Ohio was now negotiating with parties who express interest in over 1 billion cubic feet per day of residue gas transportation, moving processing gas from Ohio plant outlets to various downstream interstate pipelines. We're pleased to announce that Dominion East Ohio recently entered into a long-term service agreement with M3 Ohio Gathering to provide significant firm gathering services for wet gas in northeastern Ohio. Under this agreement, Dominion will receive 180 million cubic feet per day of gas from Utica in conventional wells committed to M3 Ohio, and we'll deliver those volumes to the Kensington processing plant, which is presently under construction. The services will be provided from existing pipeline assets, with limited capital upgrades to support the project. We will begin this gathering service for phases of Kensington that are slated to come online early 2014.
We're continuing to develop a liquefaction project at The project, which is expected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion, exclusive of financing costs, has a planned capacity of approximately 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet, and 4.5 million to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet. 
Dominion has continued to receive strong interest from the market and is in advanced negotiations with multiple parties for definitive terminal service agreements. We have made significant progress toward finalizing these agreements and remain confident that the full plant capacity will be contracted by the end of this year. 
On October 1, a hearing was held in Maryland State Court in our request for declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. Part of the agreement in issue is the Maryland Conversation Council filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. The decision is expected on this matter later this year. 
The front end engineering and design studies on schedule and are progressing well. FERC prefiling process is also progressing in accordance with plan. 2 open house meetings have been held with the public to discuss the scope of the project. FERC issued its notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment that will address the potential environmental impact of the construction and operation facility supporting the project. We will provide a more detailed testament early next year as though studies become more defined and we finalize our financing plans. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies and execution of terminal services agreements and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017. 
At Virginia Power, economic growth is continuing to drive improving results. Compared to 2011, weather adjusted sales are up 1.5% year-to-date. Year-over-year growth in sales to data centers was 9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date. for the third quarter were also well above last year's level. in the first 9 months in 2012 actually are about 30% higher from the comparable period of 2011. In the regulatory front, hearings were held in October in our application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a $53 million increase in base rates, less a $27 million reduction in fuel revenues. Net revenue increase of $26 million incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. We expect the decision by year end. At September 15, a hearing was held in our Virginia spring court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by Station Corporation Commission to be used in next year's manual review. The effective to date will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%. 
So including the statutory Return on Equity color, the appeal will determine the return on equity to be used for the biannual review of 2011 and 2012 earnings as 11.4% or 11.86%. 
We expect the final decision next month. 
Virginia Power's return on equity computed using gas earnings adjusted for rate making was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results through the third quarter of 2012, Virginia Power's similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 21 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biannual review is about 9.5%. 
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results and met our expectations. We continue to move forward all of our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings per share growth in 2013 and beyond. Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Kewaunee is a very unfortunate situation. It's superbly operating plant. There are great people there, but it is a relatively small nuclear facility There's no capacity payments there. Gas prices have reduced the energy prices there, which I think is very difficult for a single unit particular facility to at least for us, to work in that market. We couldn't make it work and apparently nobody else could either since we found no buyers, but I don't think that's a comparable situation to Breaking Point and Kincaid."

You know, we are seeing strong growth, Tom mentioned 1.5% year-to-date weather normalized sales. We've mentioned in previous quarters that there's been some ramp rate demand around data centers. We saw that pick. I think from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see a little lumpiness but from a revenue standpoint, those customers have contract minimum demand. So we're protected but I think you see that kind of coming through a little bit this quarter. Industrial sales are down about 100,000 megawatt hours against the total system of about $23 million for the quarter. We're not a very intense industrial marketplace with sort of a Northern Virginia, central and eastern Virginia. And it is just kind of a lot of small numbers added up. I would say if you look at our top 5 industrial customers, their consumption is up. That's good. So what you see in the kit is really the actual sales based on the weather, but when we kind of peel it back, we have seen very strong sales with our data centers and generally, kind of the accumulation of new over the last 12 months."

Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share wh",1491,"Good morning. Dominion's 2012 third quarter operating earnings were $0.92 per share, toward the bottom of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share when compared to normal. While temperatures, as measured by degree days, were above normal, other factors impacting weather-related demand, principally low humidity, offset the higher temperatures. Although the degree days were above normal in July, they were close to normal in August and below normal in September.
Additionally, the highest temperatures during the quarter occurred in the aftermath of the derecho storm in early July, where over 1.2 million of our customers lost power. Full restoration took nearly a week, which prevented us from benefiting from the extreme weather.
Through the first 9 months of 2012, mild weather conditions have reduced earnings by a total of $0.17 per share compared to normal. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on the results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to the midpoint of our guidance range where a storm-related outage at our Hastings processing plant and an unplanned outage at Millstone, due to water temperature limitations that required us to remove Unit 2 from service for almost 2 weeks.
Earnings for GAAP purposes were $0.36 per share for the third quarter. Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close the Kewaunee nuclear plant and the associated write-down of the investment in that plant. This was the principal factor for the lower GAAP earnings for the quarter.
Other differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the results related to the Brayton Point, Kincaid and Elwood Power Stations that we are in the process of selling. Consistent with our treatment of previous transactions, results for these assets were excluded from operating earnings as of this quarter. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $242 million, which was just below the midpoint of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected results at Dominion Retail, due to mark-to-market changes, were partially offset by lower-than-expected storm costs and lower operating expenses.
Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $178 million, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Derecho storm had a negative impact on operations at our Hastings processing plant. This unit was off-line due to a loss of off-site power for several days, which impacted processing volumes and income. The overall weakness in the storage and gas transportation markets also impacted results from both the Gas Transmission and Producer Services businesses.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $617 million for the third quarter, which was also below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower ancillary service revenues and higher operating expenses were the principal factors driving the results for the regulated Generation business. In the merchant business, the Millstone outage I referred to earlier was the principal driver for lower merchant generation contributions.
On a consolidated basis, both interest expenses and income taxes came in better than our estimates. Consistent with past practices, interest expenses associated with the merchant plants are now being -- that are now being sold have been excluded from operating earnings. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues, helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35% for the quarter compared to our guidance range of 36.5% to 37%. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be about 35% to 35.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first 9 months of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. During the quarter, we extended the term of these credit facilities by an additional year to September 2017. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.4 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We issued slightly more than $1 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes for the parent company in September. We were pleased with the market's response to our offering and thank those of you who participated.
We had planned to issue an additional $750 million of Virginia Power debt in the fourth quarter, but have decided to push that issue into 2013 based on current cash projections. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for a substantial portion of our anticipated 2013 debt needs and have begun to lock in rates for 2014 needs as well.
As part of our 2012 and 2013 financing plans, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity in each of those years.
The expected proceeds from the sale of the 3 merchant power stations should be sufficient to offset any need for market equity in 2013, as well as reduce some of our debt need.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter within a range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. This compares with the original operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011, which included about $0.08 per share of weather hurdle [ph]. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, positive drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather, earnings from our newly completed growth projects at Dominion Energy, sales growth at Virginia Power and higher Rider-related revenues from our generation growth projects. Negative drivers for the quarter include lower merchant generation margins and a higher effective tax rate.
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 has been $3.10 to $3.35 per share. With normal weather, our year-to-date operating earnings would have been $2.53 per share rather than the $2.36 per share we have reported. Adding the middle of our fourth quarter guidance range to our reported year-to-date operating earnings would result in a full year operating earnings that would be below the bottom of our guidance range. Therefore, absent a cold fourth quarter, it will be difficult for us to achieve full year results that are within that range. However, when adjusted for weather, we expect earnings in the middle of our guidance range, which is 5% to 6% above the $3.05 per share we earned in 2011.
Last month, we issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase over the middle of our guidance range for 2012. Therefore, the weather hurdle we have experienced in 2012 would have no impact on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. With the decision to sell the Brayton Point and Kincaid Power Stations and our 50% interest in the Elwood Power Station, we will no longer include these positions in our hedge disclosure. Since our last earnings call, we have made no changes to our hedge position for Millstone. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices for the remainder of 2012 is less than $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only about $0.025 per share.
As shown on Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the third quarter were toward the bottom of our guidance range. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact in our results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to midpoint of the guidance range were mild weather, higher operating expenses and unplanned outages at Hastings and Millstone.
Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We expect weather-normalized earnings for 2012 to be in the middle of our original guidance range and consistent with our 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we have issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase of the middle of our guidance range for 2012.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date, net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 99%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the 9 -- first 9 months of 2012 was an impressive 95%.
Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close and decommission the Kewaunee nuclear power station. Last year, we announced our intention to sell the facility because it no longer fits strategically with our merchant portfolio. However, we are unable to find a buyer for Kewaunee and expect to cease power production in the second quarter of next year and move to safe shutdown. The decommissioning obligation is fully funded.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on-budget and on-schedule following 4 years of construction.
During the third quarter, significant progress was made toward biomass commissioning, which should be completed during the fourth quarter. Construction activities are progressing for the 1,329 megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant. The EPC contractor has poured the foundations for the major equipment components. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014 and is on-time and on-budget.
The company advanced plans for another 1,300-megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have cost similar to the Warren County plant. We have made progress with equipment procurement, gas supply agreements and permitting is underway.
On July 31, Dominion executed the EPC contract with Fluor and issued a limited notice to proceed. We expect to file a CPCN and Rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission next month.
The projects to convert the AltaVista, Southhampton and Hopewell Power Stations from coal-to-biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. Engineering is 95% complete, and the 3 projects are expected to reach commercial operations prior to the end of next year.
The company is proposing to modify the existing Bremo Power Station Units 3 and 4 by converting them to use natural gas instead of coal. Our minor air permit modification has been submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality, and a fixed-price EPC contract for this work has been awarded. A CPCN application was filed with the State Corporation Commission in August. Pending the receipt of the required approvals, the station will commence operations on natural gas beginning in the summer of 2014.
Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. The Appalachian Gateway Project was placed into service on September 1, on time and below budget. Pipeline expansion will relieve congestion in the region allowing conventional natural gas production to move to market.
Both the next -- Northeast Expansion and the Ellisburg to Craigs Projects are expected to be in service next week, on-time and on budget.
Development of the Utica Shale formation is proceeding, as demonstrated by the leading indicators of announced well permits and drilling activity. Through early October, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had issued 413 horizontal well permits to multiple producers with 176 wells drilled today, 35 of those wells are now producing. 24 rigs are currently on location in Ohio.
Dominion continues to leverage our Ohio and West Virginia infrastructure in support of this rapidly growing energy supply. Construction of Natrium in Phase I is moving forward. The inlet, outlet and product lines are expected to be complete in November.
All major equipment, spheres and towers have been set, and piping and electrical work has been progressing well. Over 900 workers are on-site, working 2 shifts to meet the late December in-service date.
As noted in our last earnings call, recent legislation paved the way for Dominion East Ohio to construct new gathering facilities and to convert existing strategically located pipelines to wet gathering service outside of utility regulation.
Building on that framework, we have entered into several gathering and processing agreements to date, and we continue to negotiate with many producers in midstream developers. And as disclosed last quarter, Dominion East Ohio is now negotiating with parties who express interest in over 1 billion cubic feet per day of residue gas transportation, moving processed gas from Ohio plant outlets to various downstream interstate pipelines.
We're pleased to announce that Dominion East Ohio recently entered into a long-term service agreement with M3 Ohio Gathering to provide significant firm gathering services for wet gas in Northeastern Ohio. Under this agreement, Dominion will receive 180 million cubic feet per day of gas from Utica in conventional wells committed to M3 Ohio, and we'll deliver those volumes to the Kensington processing plant, which is presently under construction. The services will be provided from existing pipeline assets, with limited capital upgrades to support the project. We will begin this gathering service for phases of Kensington that are slated to come online in early 2014.
We are continuing to develop a liquefaction project at Cove Point. The project, which is expected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion, exclusive of financing costs, has a planned capacity of approximately 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and 4.5 million to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet.
Dominion has continued to receive strong interest from the market and is in advanced negotiations with multiple parties for definitive terminal service agreements. We have made significant progress toward finalizing these agreements and remain confident that the full plant capacity will be contracted by the end of this year.
On October 1, a hearing was held in Maryland State Court in our request for declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. The other part of the agreement, it issues the Maryland Conversation Council to file a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. A decision is expected on this matter later this year.
The front-end engineering and design studies are on schedule and are progressing well. The FERC prefiling process is also progressing in accordance with the plan. Two open-house meetings have been held with the public to discuss the scope of the project. FERC issued its notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment that will address the potential environmental impact of the construction in operational facility supporting the project. We will provide a more detailed assessment early next year as both studies become more defined and we finalize our financing plans. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in-service date in 2017.
At Virginia Power, economic growth is continuing to drive improving results. Compared to 2011, weather-adjusted sales are up 1.5% year-to-date. Year-over-year growth in sales to data centers was 9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date. New connects for the third quarter were also well above last year's level. New connects in the first 9 months of 2012 actually are about 30% higher than the comparable period of 2011.
On the regulatory front, hearings were held in October on our application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a $53 million increase in base rates, less a $27 million reduction in fuel revenues. The net revenue increase of $26 million incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. We expect the decision by year end.
On September 15, a hearing was held in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biannual review. The effective date will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%.
So including the statutory return on equity collar, the appeal will determine if the return on equity to be used for the biannual review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. We expect the final decision next month.
Virginia Power's return on equity computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate-making was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results through the third quarter of 2012, Virginia Power's similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 21 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biannual review is about 9.5%.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results that met our expectations. We continue to move forward all of our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings per share growth in 2013 and beyond.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Kewaunee is a very unfortunate situation. It's a superbly operating plant. There are great people there, but it is a relatively small nuclear facility. In MISO, there's no capacity payments there. Gas prices have reduced the energy prices there, which I think is very difficult for a single-unit nuclear facility to, at least for us, to work in that market. We couldn't make it work and apparently nobody else could either since we found no buyers. But I don't think that's a comparable situation to a Brayton Point and Kincaid."

This was the hot thing. Everybody's going to do that. And then we saw, I don't know how many LNG imports that's going to be built. 30 of them or something like 43 of them were going to get built. And I think about 3 of them got built. We have lots and lots and lots of announcements around LNG exporting. In our situation, we have -- we already have an import facility. We have the terminal, we have the pipes, we have the storage. We have a pipe that goes directly into the Marcellus and Utica Shale that's dedicated to Cove Point. All we need to do is build the liquefier. So the environmental impacts are, we believe, very modest. We think that's what FERC review will demonstrate.  There's not going to be another one built on the East Coast of the United States, I do not believe. So we were early in the queue. We're not first in the queue, we're not second in the queue, but we're on the top 25%, first 25% in the queue. We're going about this just in a very working-like manner. We're not paying much attention to all the other announcements. We're dealing with our customers and our feed studies, our financing plans, and we have to deal with the Sierra Club on this one particular issue and forging ahead with the FERC process. So we're going to keep at it every day, step-by-step. And we believe we will get all the necessary approvals, but that also remains to be seen."

But they are modest compared to the string of them that you heard from us in 2011. A lot of that does have to do with the fact that we are at this point concentrating on completing the Cove Point terminal services agreements, which we expect to have by the end of the year and concentrating again on the engineering work that's being done around getting those feed studies completed so that we can finalize the rest of those plans. So I'd say it's a combination of both, but largely more -- I would weight it more toward our concentration on Cove Point at this point. If you remember last fall, fall of '11, when we laid out our growth plan, we had -- we said there was about $1 billion in potential projects that we didn't have in our growth plan and were not part of our 5% to 6% earnings growth, but they were out there. We were working on them. I said in September this year that we were replacing that $1 billion with the additional $2.5 million to $3.5 million from Cove Point. And Cove Point, similarly, is not in our 5% to 6% earnings growth plan that we've developed for you in talking about in '13, '14, '15, et cetera, because Cove Point won't come online until 2017.

Dominion's 2012 third quarter operating earnings were $0.92 per share, toward the bottom of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share when compared to normal. While temperatures, as measured by degree days, were above normal, other factors impacting weather-related demand, principally low humidity, offset the higher temperatures. Although the degree days were above normal in July, they were close to normal in August and below normal in September.
Additionally, the highest temperatures during the quarter occurred in the aftermath of the derecho storm in early July, where over 1.2 million of our customers lost power. Full restoration took nearly a week, which prevented us from benefiting from the extreme weather.
Through the first 9 months of 2012, mild weather conditions have reduced earnings by a total of $0.17 per share compared to normal. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on the results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to the midpoint of our guidance range where a storm-related outage at our Hastings processing plant and an unplanned outage at Millstone, due to water temperature limitations that required us to remove Unit 2 from service for almost 2 weeks.
Earnings for GAAP purposes were $0.36 per share for the third quarter. Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close the Kewaunee nuclear plant and the associated write-down of the investment in that plant. This was the principal factor for the lower GAAP earnings for the quarter.
Other differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the results related to the Brayton Point, Kincaid and Elwood Power Stations that we are in the process of selling. Consistent with our treatment of previous transactions, results for these assets were excluded from operating earnings as of this quarter. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $242 million, which was just below the midpoint of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected results at Dominion Retail, due to mark-to-market changes, were partially offset by lower-than-expected storm costs and lower operating expenses.
Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $178 million, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. The derecho storm had a negative impact on operations at our Hastings processing plant. This unit was off-line due to a loss of off-site power for several days, which impacted processing volumes and income. The overall weakness in the storage and gas transportation markets also impacted results from both the Gas Transmission and Producer Services businesses.
Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $617 million for the third quarter, which was also below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower ancillary service revenues and higher operating expenses were the principal factors driving the results for the regulated Generation business. In the merchant business, the Millstone outage I referred to earlier was the principal driver for lower merchant generation contributions.
On a consolidated basis, both interest expenses and income taxes came in better than our estimates. Consistent with past practices, interest expenses associated with the merchant plants are now being -- that are now being sold, have been excluded from operating earnings. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues, helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35% for the quarter compared to our guidance range of 36.5% to 37%. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be about 35% to 35.5%.
Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first 9 months of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. During the quarter, we extended the term of these credit facilities by an additional year to September 2017. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.4 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.
Now moving to our financing plans. We issued slightly more than $1 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes for the parent company in September. We were pleased with the market's response to our offering and thank those of you who participated.
We had planned to issue an additional $750 million of Virginia Power debt in the fourth quarter, but have decided to push that issue into 2013 based on current cash projections. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for a substantial portion of our anticipated 2013 debt needs and have begun to lock in rates for 2014 needs as well.
As part of our 2012 and 2013 financing plans, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity in each of those years.
The expected proceeds from the sale of the 3 merchant power stations should be sufficient to offset any need for market equity in 2013, as well as reduce some of our debt need.
Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter within a range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011, which included about $0.08 per share of weather hurdle. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, positive drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather, earnings from our newly-completed growth projects at Dominion Energy, sales growth at Virginia Power and higher Rider-related revenues from our generation growth projects. Negative drivers for the quarter include lower merchant generation margins and a higher effective tax rate.
Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 has been $3.10 to $3.35 per share. With normal weather, our year-to-date operating earnings would have been $2.53 per share rather than the $2.36 per share we have reported. Adding the middle of our fourth quarter guidance range to our reported year-to-date operating earnings would result in a full year operating earnings that would be below the bottom of our guidance range. Therefore, absent a cold fourth quarter, it will be difficult for us to achieve full year results that are within that range. However, when adjusted for weather, we expect earnings in the middle of our guidance range, which is 5% to 6% above the $3.05 per share we earned in 2011.
Last month, we issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase over the middle of our guidance range for 2012. Therefore, the weather hurdle we have experienced in 2012 should have no impact on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond.
As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. With the decision to sell the Brayton Point and Kincaid Power Stations and our 50% interest in the Elwood Power Station, we will no longer include these positions in our hedge disclosure. Since our last earnings call, we have made no changes to our hedge position for Millstone. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices for the remainder of 2012 is less than $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only about $0.025 per share.
As shown on Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.
So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the third quarter were toward the bottom of our guidance range. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to midpoint of the guidance range were mild weather, higher operating expenses and unplanned outages at Hastings and Millstone.
Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We expect weather-normalized earnings for 2012 to be in the middle of our original guidance range and consistent with our 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we have issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase of the middle of our guidance range for 2012.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell."

Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date, net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 99%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the 9 -- first 9 months of 2012 was an impressive 95%.
Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close and decommission the Kewaunee nuclear power station. Last year, we announced our intention to sell the facility because it no longer fit strategically with our merchant portfolio. However, we were unable to find a buyer for Kewaunee and expect to cease power production in the second quarter of next year and move to safe shutdown. The decommissioning obligation is fully funded.
Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on-budget and on-schedule following 4 years of construction.
During the third quarter, significant progress was made toward biomass commissioning, which should be completed during the fourth quarter. Construction activities are progressing for the 1,329 megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant. The EPC contractor has poured the foundations for the major equipment components. This fully-wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014 and is on-time and on-budget.
The company advanced plans for another 1,300-megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. We have made progress with equipment procurement, gas supply agreements and permitting is underway.
On July 31, Dominion executed the EPC contract with Fluor and issued a limited notice to proceed. We expect to file a CPCN and Rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission next month.
The projects to convert the AltaVista, Southhampton and Hopewell Power Stations from coal to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. Engineering is 95% complete, and the 3 projects are expected to reach commercial operations prior to the end of next year.
The company is proposing to modify the existing Bremo Power Station Units 3 and 4 by converting them to use natural gas instead of coal. A minor air permit modification has been submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality, and a fixed-price EPC contract for this work has been awarded. A CPCN application was filed with the State Corporation Commission in August. Pending the receipt of the required approvals, the station will commence operations on natural gas beginning in the summer of 2014.
Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. The Appalachian Gateway Project was placed into service on September 1, on time and below budget. Pipeline expansion will relieve congestion in the region allowing conventional natural gas production to move to market.
Both the next -- Northeast Expansion and the Ellisburg to Craigs Projects are expected to be in service next week, on-time and on budget.
Development of the Utica Shale formation is proceeding, as demonstrated by the leading indicators of announced well permits and drilling activity. Through early October, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had issued 413 horizontal well permits to multiple producers with 176 wells drilled to-date. 35 of those wells are now producing. 24 rigs are currently on location in Ohio.
Dominion continues to leverage our Ohio and West Virginia infrastructure in support of this rapidly-growing energy supply. The construction of Natrium in Phase I is moving forward. The inlet, outlet and product lines are expected to be complete in November.
All major equipment, spheres and towers have been set, and piping and electrical work has been progressing well. Over 900 workers are on-site, working 2 shifts to meet the late December in-service date.
As noted in our last earnings call, recent legislation paved the way for Dominion East Ohio to construct new gathering facilities and to convert existing strategically-located pipelines to wet gathering service outside of utility rate regulation.
Building on that framework, we have entered into several gathering and processing agreements to date, and we continue to negotiate with many producers and midstream developers. And as disclosed last quarter, Dominion East Ohio is now negotiating with parties who express interest in over 1 billion cubic feet per day of residue gas transportation, moving processed gas from Ohio plant outlets to various downstream interstate pipelines.
We're pleased to announce that Dominion East Ohio recently entered into a long-term service agreement with M3 Ohio Gathering to provide significant firm gathering services for wet gas in Northeastern Ohio. Under this agreement, Dominion will receive 180 million cubic feet per day of gas from Utica in conventional wells committed to M3 Ohio, and we'll deliver those volumes to the Kensington processing plant, which is presently under construction. The services will be provided from existing pipeline assets, with limited capital upgrades to support the project. We will begin this gathering service for phases of Kensington that are slated to come online in early 2014.
We are continuing to develop a liquefaction project at Cove Point. The project, which is expected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion, exclusive of financing costs, has a planned capacity of approximately 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and 4.5 million to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet.
Dominion has continued to receive strong interest from the market and is in advanced negotiations with multiple parties for definitive terminal service agreements. We have made significant progress toward finalizing these agreements and remain confident that the full plant capacity will be contracted by the end of this year.
On October 1, a hearing was held in Maryland State Court in our request for declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. A decision is expected on this matter later this year.
The front-end engineering and design studies are on schedule and are progressing well. The FERC prefiling process is also progressing in accordance with plan. Two open-house meetings have been held with the public to discuss the scope of the project. FERC issued its notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment that will address the potential environmental impact of the construction and operational facility supporting the project. We will provide a more detailed cost estimate early next year as those studies become more defined and we finalize our financing plans. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in-service date in 2017.
At Virginia Power, economic growth is continuing to drive improving results. Compared to 2011, weather-adjusted sales are up 1.5% year-to-date. Year-over-year growth in sales to data centers was 9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date. New connects for the third quarter were also well above last year's level. New connects in the first 9 months of 2012 actually are about 30% higher than the comparable period for 2011.
On the regulatory front, hearings were held in October on our application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a $53 million increase in base rates, less a $27 million reduction in fuel revenues. The net revenue increase of $26 million incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. We expect the decision by year end.
On September 15, a hearing was held in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biannual review. The effective date will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%.
So including the statutory return on equity collar, the appeal will determine if the return on equity to be used for the biannual review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. We expect the final decision next month.
Virginia Power's return on equity computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate-making was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results through the third quarter of 2012, Virginia Power's similarly-adjusted return on equity for the first 21 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biannual review is about 9.5%.
So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results that met our expectations. We continue to move forward all of our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings per share growth in 2013 and beyond.
Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions."

Kewaunee is a very unfortunate situation. It's a superbly operating plant. There are great people there, but it is a relatively small nuclear facility. In MISO, there's no capacity payments there. Gas prices have reduced the energy prices there, which I think is very difficult for a single-unit nuclear facility to, at least for us, to work in that market. We couldn't make it work and apparently nobody else could either since we found no buyers. But I don't think that's a comparable situation to a Brayton Point, Kincaid."

And so it has to be above the 50 basis points twice, the collar, twice, consecutively. In order to ask for a base rate increase, you only have to be below the 50-basis-point collar once. We believe we will be significantly below the 50-basis-point collar at the end of the biannual review, which means that we -- triggers the possibility of a rate increase, so that we anticipate -- and the way the commission ruled last year was that we should -- if there's going to be a base rate case, it should be filed at the same time as the biannual review. So the ROE issue will be basically the same in both of them, but we will be filing for all of our increased costs that we've been associated with, the run rate we've had at the company. There'll be more traditional rate cases. Of course, you don't have any of the Riders in there.

We've mentioned in previous quarters that there's been some ramp-rate demand around data centers. We saw that pick up. So I think from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see a little lumpiness there. But from a revenue standpoint, those customers have contract minimum demand, so we're protected. But I see -- I think you see that kind of coming through a little bit this quarter. Industrial sales are down about 100,000 megawatt hours. Of course, that's against the total system of about 23 million for the quarter. We're not a very intense industrial marketplace with sort of a Northern Virginia, Central and Eastern Virginia. And it is just kind of a lot of small numbers added up. I would say if you looked at our top 5 industrial customers, their consumption is up, so that's good.

But if you looked at Dominion Retail from the first quarter kit to the second quarter kit to what was put out this morning, what you will see is that we've been able to hold steady at about 700,000 electric customers, about 550,000 gas customers, and our products and services business continues to expand. So what we've seen is competition. We've been able to hold our customer count steady in the face of that competition. And with the cost of supplies, we've actually been able to improve our margins a little bit. But it's a daily challenge and one that we're well aware of. What will happen if we get on a price uptrend? What we see is customers tend to shop less because they know they're going to be getting a higher price. So in some respects, we view that as a good thing. But during this downturn, it's been tough."

The year-over-year difference has persisted throughout the year, and that is principally related to a decision we made last December to turn back a fairly large block of customers where we did not believe we could beat the price to compare and maintain our margin. And we did not think it was worth maintaining the volume and commodity risk without commensurate margin. So that was a decision that we made last December, and it's persisted throughout. And frankly, we've got one more quarter where you'll see that. So I think, to me, the relevant number is how have we done since that decision has been made. And if you look back, as I mentioned earlier, at the first quarter kit and second quarter kit, you'll see that we've been holding really steady.
With respect to the merchant power plant sales, I'll turn that back over to Mark."

And my second question is about Cove Point and the fact that you haven't really told us anything about financing. I mean when I look at your midstream business, you're obviously completing your existing projects, but we haven't really heard about any new projects. It seems like Natrium 2 has been pushed out, and you haven't really made any announcements about new projects. Is it somewhat related to the Cove Point expansion in a way that you are holding onto cash and your debt financing capabilities because you might be needed to finance Cove Point? Or is this simply the general lack of projects in the midstream business that you would consider attractive?"

But they are modest compared to the string of them that you heard from us in 2011. A lot of that does have to do with the fact that we are at this point concentrating on completing the Cove Point terminal services agreements, which we expect to have by the end of the year and concentrating again on the engineering work that's being done around getting those feed studies completed so that we can finalize the rest of those plans. So I'd say it's a combination of both, but largely more -- I would weight it more toward our concentration on Cove Point at this point. If you remember last fall, fall of '11, when we laid out our growth plan, we had -- we said there was about $1 billion in potential projects that we didn't have in our growth plan and were not part of our 5% to 6% earnings growth, but they were out there. We were working on them. I said early in September this year that we were replacing that $1 billion with the additional $2.5 million to $3.5 million from Cove Point. And Cove Point, similarly, is not in our 5% to 6% earnings growth plan that we've developed for you in talking about in '13, '14, '15, et cetera, because Cove Point won't come online until 2017. But we've also said before, we are looking at a variety of ways to finance Cove Point to make sure that it doesn't curtail our growth plans while it is in the middle of its construction."
