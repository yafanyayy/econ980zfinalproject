I'll begin with comments in our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down f",1038,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments in our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of2013 common stock for $277 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased at $10.91 billion, up 40% or 47%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $154 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales were $13.83 billion or 79.3% of revenue compared with the 79.7%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $3.14 million or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 million. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 million, representing 69% of North American revenues, up from 63%. North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2 point -- In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion, adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%. Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of International revenues, up from 49%. 
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%. CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter in a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full-year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion and International grew 30% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million or 1.8% of net sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $840 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion and inventory turns were 10.3 down from 11.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors that, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could  differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can now have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 36% decline. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions."

And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over the last several years from the unit perspective in launching Kindle Photo. It's on a very good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we continually trying to improve all of our processes are down from the customer standpoint. And that includes our fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you see over the last several years, we are we've gotten closer and closer to customers from this speed standpoint. And we do that and not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third-party sort of participating in Fulfilled by Amazon, and one of the things that you're seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth and you're seeing that we expanded our third-party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is utterly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from the customer standpoint, those units are available for express 2 shipping or 1 if you're Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers."

In terms of our overall -- I'll talk to the total worldwide, as well as to the North America piece. But I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34% excluding exchange.

But I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34% excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 of 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth that's a paid unit growth was 46%, again this is globally in Q4, that compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in the unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party unit as a percentage of total units was 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption, certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of that is presumably over the last few years. And that certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only booked a portion of the revenue base in the commissions we received for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as international. The other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America, if you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there were some impact from in certain subcategories related to the term apply certainly impacted from supply. But again, the good news is, we certainly had some good third-party offerings and many of those of subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is that North American media, we saw a very, very strong growth and Digital Media from books to video, music are all those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in the video games. We had very strong third-party offerings to third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games is up at our revenue was down, and that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers is also impacting the top line, and we just record a portion of that sale, the commission but you're seeing a positive impact in operating income, which is why you see it came in at little bit above the guidance that we gave."

Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our web services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. we added, as we've talked about last call, we plan to add 17 FEs, which is what we did in 2011 bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high-growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making.

It was up from a unit's perspective. And again, the reason why it's up is because we had a strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind though, certainly, consoles are part of that.

In terms of growth, and you mentioned Western Europe, if you take a look at the international in Q4, it was up 29% on a local-currency basis. It did held up pretty well given obviously the challenges that are going on specifically in Europe from an economic standpoint. We're not -- we don't view ourselves as a bell weather for the economy.

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial result. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down fr",1037,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial result. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million.
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue compared with the 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%.
North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2 point -- in the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%.
Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 49%.
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%.
CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased to $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.
Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could  differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

We had a -- our unit sales nearly tripled. It was up 177%, and that includes both our Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. So we're very pleased with the great growth we had. And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on a very good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the last several years, we've gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third-parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing on our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third-party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from a customer standpoint, those units are available for express 2-day shipping or a 1-day if you're a Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers."

But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party units as a percentage of total units was 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is in North American media, we saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because we just recorded a portion of that sale, the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave."

Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our Web Services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. We added -- as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making.

Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in particular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality.

We did see some supply issues with the Thailand flood, certainly some subcategories within some of the hard lines businesses as a result. We think those things will work themselves out over time. But we're incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have, and that's why we have invested the way we have and why we're continuing to invest in the business. So we're very pleased to see it and very pleased to have the opportunities that we have in front of us."

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million.
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%.
North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2.9% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%.
Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 49%.
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%.
CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.
Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the last several years, we've gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third party as a percentage of total units.

But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party units as a percentage of total units were 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is in North America media, we saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because we just recorded a portion of that sale, the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave."

But if you break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last several calls, we've just seen such dramatic growth in both, first of all, from a retail perspective, on our retail offerings, been growing very fast. Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our Web Services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. We added -- as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making.

Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in particular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality.

Service revenue is up approximately 74% year-over-year in Q4. And then in terms of fulfillment, we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4, we're finalizing our plans for what we're going to do there.

And so that's no different. That's not different this year than in other years. What is different is growth was down from a revenue perspective year-over-year. It was up from a units perspective. And again, the reason why it was up is because we had strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind though, certainly console is a part of that.

Fulfillment was $1.26 million or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $815 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%.
Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased to $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion, and inventory turns were 10.4, down from $0.116 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure, including the Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the System acquisitions, which we expect to close and second quarter 2012 and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. This anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

So we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up over approximately 300 basis points over last year.

Some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment and so you so some of that impacting Q4, as well as in Q1. The good news for us is platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we have supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we have third-party that may have had still have inventories. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1.

And the second question is on the percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that you got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, when we think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalized, do we expect that to normalize of back down from 39% back down to the mid-30s?

And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamics that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with the stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where it moderate, it's hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple of years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is fulfilled by Amazon. And so that certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operated in and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareholders. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. But the stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's a certainly one of the benefits for model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't see at that substantial drive for what's happened in the third party over the last few years. It's other things that we prove that experience for sellers."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down f",1010,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads down-focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

But again, we're experiencing a very, very strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing that in our third-party growth. Our third-party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing very well. So again, we're continuing to invest, and the number is 13."

As we've talked about in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity for investing there. So that's some of dynamics that are impacting International. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies. But those are things are a little bit different. In terms of third-party growth, we're seeing very strong third-party growth across International, as well as North America, so pleased to do that. And we're investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that."

And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive-up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily just due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Are there anything else in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that -- all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, would was that -- are we seeing that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns?

But in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, certainly mix and businesses is one. But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up over approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it."

One other color just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range in both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacities to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about."

And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as in Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1.

And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, when we think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize, would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s?

And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple of years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial drive for what's happened in the third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to prove that experience with sellers."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down f",1012,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business.

I just mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly, our digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One other call-out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about."

And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast.

And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?"

And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down f",1012,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term.

So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings.

And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast.

And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such.

Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?"

And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers."

Return on invested ca",1054,"Thanks, Sean, I'll begin with some comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11% down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of a long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32%, excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.  While grateful to our customers, we continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%.  Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 74%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased to 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a onetime expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion and inventory turns were 10.1  down from 11.3 turns year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.  Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. 
Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investment in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our funded operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, favorable resolution of legal matters and tickets our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance of further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income at comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income or between 129% decline and 14% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain hands-down focused on driving better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first to is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
With that, Sean, let's move the question."

One thing to keep in mind is for both of the total business, international growth and international media, we had very, very strong growth last year, Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business. And on a local currency basis of 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we had in over 10 years so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%. On a local currency basis, it was up 12%. And certainly, it's a challenging compare. Also, there were some things just with -- as we some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that we know is for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen, that moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint.

Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters. And that we're investing certainly for the long-term. Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for almost seasonal quarter, and we expect, given the growth that we've had, we're seeing very strong growth. So we're investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity for example, we've announced 18 new fulfillment centers. So far this year, we've actually opened 8 of those already this year out of the 18. And we're looking at potentially opening even more than that -- I'm sorry, 6 opened so far this year out of 18.

You see that knowing our operating results but you see it on a CapEx. In the last 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2.

But one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in the upcoming quarter to Q3 and we are certainly getting ready given the growth rates we've had for our most seasonal quarter. That's certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our hard guidance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're opening a lot of fulfillment centers.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital",1051,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11% down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of a long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32%, excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, the revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 74%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased to 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a onetime expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion and inventory turns were 10.1  down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.  Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. 
Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income at comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income or between 129% decline and 14% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first to is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
With that, Sean, let's move to questions."

Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep -- that's all on a currency basis. One thing to keep in mind is for both the total business, international growth and international media, we had a very, very strong growth last year, Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business. And on a local currency basis about 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%. On a local currency basis, it was up 12%. And certainly, it's a challenging compare. Also, there were some things just with -- as we -- some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that we know for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen, it moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint.

And second, is -- can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth? As in -- probably, this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance.

That again is a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short-term versus long-term, we're all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically, around Q3. Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters. And that we're investing certainly for the long-term. Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for our most seasonal quarter, and we expect, given the growth that we've had, we're seeing a very strong growth so we're investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity, for example, we've announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We've actually opened 8 of those already this year out of the 18. And we're looking at potentially opening even more than that -- and sorry -- I'm sorry, 6 opened so far this year out of 18. And so those are certainly something that are impacting across so far and you'll be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter."

One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit, as well as our gross margin was a third-party business, continued to be very, very strong. And certainly, that was a factor. Again there was a number of factors. One thing, too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4. You see that knowing our operating results but you see it on our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2. We spent a little less than $700 million. You see that number for Q3 being $800 million to $900 million as well, $800 million to $900 million.

So again, those are great -- that's certainly that's a great program for customers, it's a great program for sellers and it's a great program for investors. And so we think of it -- I don't think of it as a bad thing at all. I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units we send directly to customers. We're offering a great experience on third-party units, which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So again, we'll continue to try to make that even better for customers as well as over time. But it's working very well.

18749,214097730,332395,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Amazon.com, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital",1050,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11% down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of a long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32%, excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 74%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a onetime expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion and inventory turns were 10.1  down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. 
Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income at comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income or between 129% decline and 14% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first to is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
With that, Sean, let's move to questions."

One thing to keep in mind is for both the Total business, International growth and International media, we had very, very strong growth last year, Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the Total business. And on a local currency basis about 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%. On a local currency basis, it was up 12%. And certainly, it's a challenging compare. Also, there were some things just with -- as we -- some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that we know were scheduled for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen, that moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint.

Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters in that we're investing certainly for the long-term. Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for our most seasonal quarter, and we expect, given the growth that we've had, we're seeing very strong growth so we're investing heavily to get ready for that.

We certainly -- as you look at -- I'll talk to Q2 since it's the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of the strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit, as well as our gross margin was our third-party business, continued to be very, very strong. And certainly, that was a factor. Again there was a number of factors. One thing, too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4. You see that not only in our operating results but you see it in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2. We spent a little less than $700 million. You see that number for Q3 being $800 million to $900 million as well, $800 million to $900 million. So again, those are the things that you're seeing, just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there."

That's one of the drivers certainly to -- that's helping us have that percentage of total units go up.

And what ends up happening is FBA sellers wants their part of the program. Those units that are FBA in our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs, including FREE Super Saver Shipping, Prime. So again, those are great -- that certainly that's a great program for customers, it's a great program for sellers and it's a great program for investors. And so we think of it -- I don't think of it as a bad thing at all. I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers. We're offering a great experience on third-party units, which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So again, we'll continue to try to make that even better for customers and sellers over time. But it's working very well. And again, those -- the benefit of having third parties on our platform is we get to add great new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come, they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So it's a competitive environment on our platform.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital",1050,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11% down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of a long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32%, excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 74%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a onetime expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. 
Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income at comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income or between 129% decline and 14% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the Total business. And on a local currency basis about 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%. On a local currency basis, it was up 12%. And certainly, it's a challenging compare. Also, there were some things just with -- as we -- some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that we know were scheduled for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen, that moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint.

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on invested capital was 10%, down f",1058,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30%, excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. 
Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and Content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 54%. 
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 10%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million. 
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity invested share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity and method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash from marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including web services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. 
It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $216 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period. 
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. 
We remain focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

But what I can tell you is in terms of our profile, if you think about the parts of our business, the Retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for shareowners. We feel it's something that we have again a lot of experience in as we've added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes, we've already launched those in other geographies so we're able to learn from the experiences we've had to date so we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses and our media business is converting to digital. So we've talked a lot about that. And feel very good about the opportunity that we have there, both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices, and so we feel good about that business, and it's growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business, that's a -- if you start with the core operation of that business, we've been in that part of the business serving Amazon customers since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC, potential of those -- of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically, and we like the ROIC potential of those. We're investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in a last couple of years, and on top of that, China. China, you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we're going to be investing in for several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns of invested capital in the short run in that geography but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in, in terms of timeline for returns and feel very good about those. So hopefully, that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs."

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results.Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.Return on invested capital was 10%, down",1056,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.
Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion, or 30%, excluding the $348-million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11%, or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36%, or 39% excluding foreign exchange.
Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. 
Now we'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion, or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion, or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now we'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange; and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of International revenues, up from 54%.
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million, or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million. 
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share, related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including web services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $216 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation, other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period.
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington.
We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

The first one is we're investing certainly very heavily in capacity. And so you're seeing that, both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there. In addition to that, we're investing in a number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls. Those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there. But certainly, those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned, is a great long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment, and it's impacting that number. In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFILM for Europe. So those are the things that are the primary drivers of which you're seeing in operating income and  international. In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot I can help you with. There's a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost, if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some of the things. But again, a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that on a shipping revenue number."

In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly -- and as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011 and '12 from a fulfillment standpoint. We've just seen unprecedented growth, and we've added a lot of capacity. In terms of where it will level off, we'll have to wait and see.

We also offer that to sellers through Fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel -- certainly, those investments we feel good. But what you are seeing is certainly, just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's on of these investments -- we only make those investments where we absolutely need to. But in terms of deploying that capital and those resources, we feel very good about it."

China's -- you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we're going to be investing in for several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns of invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies.

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results.Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.Return on invested capital was 10%, down",1056,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.
Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30%, excluding the $348-million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11%, or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36%, or 39% excluding foreign exchange.
Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. 
Now we'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion, or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion, or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now we'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange; and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of International revenues, up from 54%.
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million, or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million. 
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share, related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including web services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $216 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation, other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period.
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington.
We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions."

The first one is we're investing certainly very heavily in capacity. And so you're seeing that, both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there. In addition to that, we're investing in a number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls. Those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there. But certainly, those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned, is a great long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment, and it's impacting that number. In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFILM for Europe. So those are the things that are the primary drivers of which you're seeing in operating income and  international. In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot I can help you with. There's a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost, if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint.

We're adding inventory, getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We're continually trying to increase our in-stock levels, so you're certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we're very excited about getting ready for a great holiday season, and that's with our own retail inventory. Certainly we have sellers who are selling on our platform will be doing the same thing, and we're getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4. In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing what that would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint, it'd be premature to do that at this stage. But we can check in, in future periods and talk more about that."

Digital content is growing very fast, and it's reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call outs with the exception of -- if you look back over the past 5 quarters, certainly, the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011, which we're lapping. So that's the other factor. But again, very, very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales. And given the new launches that we've had recently, that'll be good for digital content sales going forward."

And since then, I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery, especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. So just -- could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people? And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And I'm just wondering, like is that a philosophical way that you're managing the business? Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to and we should expect this sort of level going forward?"

And what I was referring to last time was -- I said -- I talked about -- with a large amount of selection broadly, that that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere. It's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint. That being said, we -- if you look back over the past several years, we have done -- added a lot of capacity. We're getting -- we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers. That has helped improve our delivery speed to customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. So what I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can, which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint. And we feel good about that. And again, you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years, and New York is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in same-day in cases."

Can you just talk about what you're seeing on returns on the investments you've been making over the last 2 years? And as far as like return on invested capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history? And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about that? And then just a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63%, and then international was plus 15% for other, and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the 2 geographies that we should think about?"

But what I can tell you is in terms of our profile, you think about the parts of our business, the Retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for shareowners. We feel it's something that we have, again, a lot of experience in as we've added new categories, in particular geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies, so we're able to learn from the experiences we've had to date. So we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses and our media business is converting to digital. So we've talked a lot about that and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices, as well as integrating content into those devices. And so we feel good about that business, and it's growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business, that's a -- if you start with the core operation of that business, we've been in that part of the business serving Amazon, the customers, since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally, as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential -- ROIC potential of those -- of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically, and we like the ROIC potential of those. We're investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in a last couple of years. And on top of that, China. China's -- you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we're going to be investing in for several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns of invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in, in terms of time line for returns and feel very good about those. So hopefully, that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs."
