Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corp's. future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the appendix of the presentation. 
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 37 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that let me turn the call over to Jeff."

Earlier this morning as you saw we released our fourth quarter, year end financial results. And I'd say to sum Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving",953,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Earlier this morning as you saw we released our fourth quarter, year end financial results. And I'd say to sum Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we're all well-positioned for margin expansion earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. 
In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion come up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material in oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As expected, out global conditions remained challenging particularly driven by Europe which is driven by the year of debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver early strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see this the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for our innovative, new product offerings, and this is driving positive mix and margins. 
Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect $200 million in fiscal savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. And as a reminder, this included over $300 million related to Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion cash at year end. 
Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items was our restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. 
So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations. Last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we have outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly in margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as it benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets that went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to our overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. 
Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. 
Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we are forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continued to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year. 
So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year of $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America."

Let me start by giving numbers may perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that previously announced actions are yielding intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price decreases, our margins has substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. 
For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the nonoperating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. 
On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases place are direct purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. 
On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipments down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new product that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown on Slide 16. As Jeff has mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4 stable the price/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow implemented January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefit. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. 
Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in September 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and innovate America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothe washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination in this petition February 2013. A final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. And you yet complete we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,146203719,213610,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand for global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rate in emerging markets. E",663,"Thanks, Mike. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand for global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rate in emerging markets. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as the European financial crisis drove weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. 
In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized last BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. 
Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampen consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. 
Slide 20 shows summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave, ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. 
Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million down from $204 million in the prior year period ago was flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact currency sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. 
Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. 
Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: one, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; two, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and three, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,146203719,213610,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significant improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.",1477,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significant improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventory entering 2012. 
Based on volume of product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits are recognized. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits impacted the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. 
Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits have included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.52 per share in the quarter compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. 
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that the full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. 
Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will know, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing basis during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on. 
I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you'll note that our 2012 earnings guidance did not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax program given that, that program would not renew at the end of 2011. Therefore, we are adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits. 
At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credit were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the real reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operations comparisons. 
For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current form of program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credit in 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balances associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to cash credits, we are also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest researcher program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 and benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. 
Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operations outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011. 
On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits; and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. 
On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. 
Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. 
Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures in pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff."

We are executing very these strong actions, and we expect them to continue to improve our operating margins through our capacity reduction initiatives, our online productivity and the previously announced price increases. Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand.

We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But given that our margin levels, we entered with external inflation we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we are very committed to, remain fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here the cost of capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year.

Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would, given the innovation we have in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012.

Earlier this morning as you saw, we released our fourth quarter and year end financial results.

Earlier this morning as you saw, we released our fourth quarter and year end financial results. And I'd say to sum up Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we are well-positioned for margin expansion, earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. 
In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion, up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material and oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As we expected, the global conditions remain challenging particularly driven by Europe, which is driven by the Euro debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver a very strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for innovative new product offerings, and this is driving a positive mix and margins. 
Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect them to yield  $200 million in fixed cost savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation, which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. As a reminder, this included over $300 million related to Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion cash at year end. 
Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items which are restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. 
So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations, last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we've outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly on margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as their  benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets, but went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. 
Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from our cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, and we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. 
Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we're forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year.
So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment, but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year is $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previous",541,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previously announced actions are yielding the intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price increases, our margins have substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. 
For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the nonoperating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. 
On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended this demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases are direct -- are replacement purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. 
On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipment down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new product that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown in Slide 16. As Jeff had mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4, but stable the price/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow with the recently January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefits. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. 
Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in December 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and to innovate and invest in America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothes washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination on this petition February 2013, and a final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. And is yet complete, we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. 
In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized last BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. 
Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampen consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to a weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. 
Slide 20 shows summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix drop through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. 
Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million, down from $204 million in the prior year period with flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. 
Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. 
Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: One, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; two, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and three, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,146203719,213754,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $",1491,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventories entering 2012.
Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits were recognized. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits adversely impact the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. 
Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits are included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.62 per share in the quarter, compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. 
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. 
Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will know, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing business operations during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.
I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you will note that our 2012 earnings guidance does not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax benefit program given that, that program would not renew at the end of 2011. Therefore, we're adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits.
At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credits were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the riyal reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operation comparisons. 
For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially identical to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current 4-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits during 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balance is associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to tax credits, we're also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 in benefits -- $200 million in benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. 
Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of a restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operation outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from our ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011.
On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits; and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a Full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. 
On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. 
Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that our pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. 
Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment, and as I previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff."

On today's call, as we outlined in October, we talked in great detail about the actions that we've taken to accelerate our ongoing business operations posed to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are executing very aptly these strong actions, and we expect them to continue to improve our operating margins through our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, our ongoing productivity and the previously announced price increases. Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand. We will have raw material inflation in the range we talked about, but we expect to fully mitigate those increases through our productivity. So overall based on these assumptions, we do expect 2012 to be a strong year with ongoing business operations improvement and driving strong shareholder value. 
So at that point in time I will conclude our formal comments and will open this up for questions."

And certainly in the third quarter, we have turned that from negative to positive. You saw in the fourth quarter that ramped up very nicely. So we're inning the year with a lot of positive momentum. We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But net-net given our margin levels, with external inflation, we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we're very committed to, and we remain, so I fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here the cost and capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year. The normal productivity of 0.5 to 1 point, I'd say that I feel very good about our actions. The 2 dimensions that affect that of course are raw materials, which sitting here today we feel comfortable with the $300 million to $350 million. That can change either way, and demand, which has an impact on conversion in the factory . So right now, we're very comfortable with what we're presenting, and I would say in any of these, that we have equal upside as we do downside, and we're confident that we're going to deliver this kind of improvement in operating performance."

At the same time, coming into 2011, we, and I believe most companies were negatively surprised about the material inflation that accelerated. So you had basically negative demand, significantly negative pricing and very negative increases in cost. And that had a profound impact on margins across the board. Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would -- given the innovation we had in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more, we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012.

What we did see, and similar to what we saw I would say in the last stimulus program was it actually drove about a 10% increase in the month of December, and we're continuing to see that kind of growth as we turn the page into the new year.

The other thing we're seeing is in markets outside of Brazil, we're continuing to see very strong growth in those markets. So we're feeling that this range that we've given is very appropriate."

There's a lot of talk that interest rate, so there's balancing going on, and we're seeing a general pick up in total. At the same time, and it's similar to your question I referred to on North America is we did take a strong stance last year, throughout the year on pricing. We have achieved that pricing. We've also taken a strong stance on mix and we've really focused on stepping up the mix, and we're having good results with that."

I would talk in the case of North America directly to answer your question, yes, we do think there's a very little relationship between change in prices and demand. And the reason we discussed before is that, that does not mean that there is not affordable products available to consumers. And we generally don't price points, but we changed the value of price points, and the consumer who's in the market ever 10 years doesn't really have a preconceived notion about what that value feature content is. So as we've been through this the last 5 years, candidly, I don't think the price increases have any impact at all on demand. In other parts of the world, it's somewhat different. Where you have emerging markets we are having first time consumers coming in where there is an affordability threshold, then we're a little bit more -- when we -- although we saw up the same need to raise prices, we're also innovating for the masses, if you will, in trying to bring more, let's say, continue to expand the affordability range with the consumers.

Earlier this morning as you saw, we released our fourth quarter and yearend financial results. And I'd say to sum up Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we are well-positioned for margin expansion, earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. 
In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion, up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material and oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As we expected, the global conditions remain challenging particularly driven by Europe, which is driven by the Euro debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver a very strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for innovative new product offerings, and this is driving a positive mix and margin. 
Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect them to yield  $200 million in fixed cost savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation, which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. As a reminder, these included over $300 million related to a Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion of cash at year end. 
Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items which are restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. 
So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations, last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we've outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly on margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as their  benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets, but went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. 
Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from our cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, and we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. 
Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we're forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year.
So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment, but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year is $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previously announced actions are yielding intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price increases, our margins have substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. 
For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the non-operating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. 
On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended this demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases are direct -- are replacement purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. 
On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipment down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new products that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown in Slide 16. As Jeff had mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4, but stable the price/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow with the recently implemented January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefits. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. 
Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in December 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and to innovate and invest in America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothes washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination on this petition February 2013, and a final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. While neither investigation is yet complete, we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,146203719,213813,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets.",667,"Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as the European financial crisis drove weak consumer demand across the Euro zone. We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. 
In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized less BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. 
Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampened consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to a weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. 
Slide 20 shows the summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix driven. Through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. 
Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million, down from $204 million in the prior year period with flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. 
Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. 
Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: 1, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; 2, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and 3, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,146203719,213813,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $",1491,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventories entering 2012.
Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits were recognized. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits adversely impact the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. 
Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits are included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.62 per share in the quarter, compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. 
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. 
Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will note, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing business operations during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.
I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you will note that our 2012 earnings guidance does not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax benefit program given that, that program was not renewed at the end of 2011. Therefore, we're adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits.
At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credits were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the real reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operation comparisons. 
For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially identical to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current 4-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits during 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balance is associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to tax credits, we're also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 in benefits -- $200 million in benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. 
Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of a restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operation outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from our ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011.
On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits, and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a Full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. 
On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. 
Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that our pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. 
Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment, and as I previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff."

As I said at the beginning, we are pleased with the momentum that we had coming out of 2011. We are seeing and have seen improving price/mix. Our inventory levels are in great shape, and we have the strongest innovative product lineup we've ever had in our 101 year history. On today's call, as we outlined in October, we talked in great detail about the actions that we've taken to accelerate our ongoing business operations posed to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are executing very rapidly these strong actions, and we expect them to continue to improve our operating margins through our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, our ongoing productivity and the previously announced price increases. Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand. We will have raw material inflation in the range we talked about, but we expect to fully mitigate those increases through our productivity. So overall based on these assumptions, we do expect 2012 to be a strong year with ongoing business operations improvement and driving strong shareholder value. 
So at that point in time I will conclude our formal comments and will open this up for questions."

Again, this is very similar to what we outlined in October, but I would say this, is that we have already turned around what for over a year was a very negative price margin mix hit to our earnings. And certainly in the third quarter, we have turned that from negative to positive. You saw in the fourth quarter that ramped up very nicely. So we're entering the year with a lot of positive momentum. We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But net-net given our margin levels, with external inflation, we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we're very committed to, and we remain committed, so I fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here, that the cost and capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year. The normal productivity of 0.5 to 1 point, I'd say that I feel very good about our actions. The 2 dimensions that affect that of course are raw materials, which sitting here today we feel comfortable with the $300 million to $350 million. That can change either way, and demand, which has an impact on conversion in the factory . So right now, we're very comfortable with what we're presenting, and I would say in any of these, that we have equal upside as we do downside, and we're confident that we're going to deliver this kind of improvement in operating performance."

At the same time, coming into 2011, we, and I believe most companies were negatively surprised about the material inflation that accelerated. So you had basically negative demand, significantly negative pricing and very negative increases in cost. And that had a profound impact on margins across the board. Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would -- given the innovation we had in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more, we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012. We think those are the right decisions for the business. We obviously have higher margins to continue to invest in bringing more innovation and value to consumers. We're pleased with the progress.

So as we've been through this the last 5 years, candidly, I don't think the price increases have any impact at all on demand. In other parts of the world, it's somewhat different. Where you have emerging markets where you're having first time consumers coming in where there is an affordability threshold, then we're a little bit more -- when we -- although we saw up the same need to raise prices, we're also innovating for the masses, if you will, in trying to bring more, let's say, continue to expand the affordability range with the consumers.

And I'd say to sum up Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we are well-positioned for margin expansion, earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. 
In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion, up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material and oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As we expected, the global conditions remain challenging particularly driven by Europe, which is driven by the Euro debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver a very strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for innovative new product offerings, and this is driving a positive mix and margin. 
Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect them to yield  $200 million in fixed cost savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation, which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. As a reminder, these included over $300 million related to a Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion of cash at year end. 
Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items which are restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. 
So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations, last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we've outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly on margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as their  benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets, but went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. 
Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from our cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, and we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. 
Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we're forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year.
So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment, but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year is $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previously announced actions are yielding intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price increases, our margins have substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. 
For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the non-operating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. 
On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended this demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases are direct -- are replacement purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. 
On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipment down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price/mix. 
Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new products that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown in Slide 16. As Jeff had mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4, but stable the price/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow with the recently implemented January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefits. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. 
Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in December 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and to innovate and invest in America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothes washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination on this petition February 2013, and a final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. While neither investigation is yet complete, we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,146203719,213932,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets.",667,"Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as the European financial crisis drove weak consumer demand across the Euro zone. We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. 
In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized less BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. 
Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampened consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to a weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. 
Slide 20 shows the summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix driven. Through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. 
Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million, down from $204 million in the prior year period with flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. 
Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. 
Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: one, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; two, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and three, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,146203719,213932,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2012",2012-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $",1491,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventories entering 2012.
Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits were recognized. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits adversely impact the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. 
Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits are included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.62 per share in the quarter, compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. 
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. 
Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will note, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing business operations during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.
I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you will note that our 2012 earnings guidance does not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax benefit program given that, that program was not renewed at the end of 2011. Therefore, we're adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits.
At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credits were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the real reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operation comparisons. 
For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially identical to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current 4-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits during 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balance is associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to tax credits, we're also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 in benefits -- $200 million in benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. 
Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of a restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operation outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from our ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011.
On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits, and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a Full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. 
On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. 
Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that our pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. 
Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment, and as I previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff."

Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand. We will have raw material inflation in the range we talked about, but we expect to fully mitigate those increases through our productivity.

So we're entering the year with a lot of positive momentum. We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But net-net given our margin levels, with external inflation, we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we're very committed to, and we remain committed, so I fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here, that the cost and capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year. The normal productivity of 0.5 to 1 point, I'd say that I feel very good about our actions. The 2 dimensions that affect that of course are raw materials, which sitting here today we feel comfortable with the $300 million to $350 million.

And there was a lot of competitive dynamics at every level that drove us into a period of really 12-month period of very negative pricing, and I'm talking largely in the North American business. At the same time, coming into 2011, we, and I believe most companies were negatively surprised about the material inflation that accelerated. So you had basically negative demand, significantly negative pricing and very negative increases in cost. And that had a profound impact on margins across the board. Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would -- given the innovation we had in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more, we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012. We think those are the right decisions for the business. We obviously have higher margins to continue to invest in bringing more innovation and value to consumers. We're pleased with the progress. We're satisfied with the innovation that we're gaining, that our market share hasn't materially changed.

So as we've been through this the last 5 years, candidly, I don't think the price increases have any impact at all on demand. In other parts of the world, it's somewhat different. Where you have emerging markets where you're having first time consumers coming in where there is an affordability threshold, then we're a little bit more -- when we -- although we saw up the same need to raise prices, we're also innovating for the masses, if you will, in trying to bring more, let's say, continue to expand the affordability range with the consumers.

Before you begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the appendix of this presentation.

We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.

At you saw earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Overall, we had a very strong start to the year as we benefited from our management expansion efforts and our continued innovation investments. Our previously announced and implemented cost base price actions along with our cost reduction initiatives have put us on track to deliver our full year 2012 length. We had particularly strong operating performance in our North America and Latin America regions. In fact, in North America ongoing operating business profits tripled year-over-year despite a 10% industry unit decline in demand.
I think the strength of our local brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong considerable preference for innovative new product launches which overall is driving very positive mix in many of our key markets. And despite the weakening of expected demand, our working capital in the first quarter is at record low driven largely by lower inventory levels.
As a reminder, during our last call, we included what we call our ongoing business operation performance, which excludes unusual items restructuring expense and tax credits. You can see our results for the quarter on Slide 6.
Sales were relatively flat despite weaker appliance demand unfavorable currency and the effects of lower BPX monetization. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.41 per share compared to $0.64 a year ago, with our operating earnings more than doubled. And we saw year-over-year improvement in our free cash flow from business operations which we'll discuss in detail later.
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see a summary of our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world for the year. However, in different parts of the world, we've seen a slow start to the year but overall globally, we see the same demand levels as we originally forecasted. In North America, we're currently seeing demand trending towards the lower end of our previous flat to plus 3 range. In Latin America, in part due to a continuous -- continuation of the Brazilian tax holiday program, combined with strong underlying economic fundamentals both in Brazil and other Latin America countries, after a very good first quarter, we see demand at our high end of plus 2 to plus 5% range for the region for the year.
In Europe, we continue to forecast an industry declined ranging from minus 2% to minus 5% for the full-year as consumer confidence in the euros remains weak. And finally, in Asia, we expect our full year demand in Asia to be at the lower end of our previously stated plus 2% to plus 4% after relatively weak demand level in Q1.
I'll now turn to Slide 8, which shows our key business drivers for the year and how they're tracking versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned, overall, we continue to benefit from the already announced global cost base price increases. As we progress through the year, we will comp against the 2011 global price increases. So we do expect price mix to continue to be a positive driver of margin expansion throughout the year but in a lesser rate than we saw in the first quarter. Our restructuring cost and capacity initiatives are on track and these benefits will ramp up and accelerate throughout the year in 2012. In addition, we still -- we will continue to bring the to strong innovation which will contribute to the overall improvement of our revenue growth, our mix and overall operating profit.
And finally, we estimate raw material inflation to be at the higher end of our $300 million to $350 million range but we still expect to more than offset all of these inflation through a strong productivity benefits which will ramp up in the second half of the year. So overall, we're pleased with a very good start in the first quarter. We are, as we look after the rest of the year, we are on track to deliver EPS and free cash flow range for the year.
At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer on an update on our North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America performance for the quarter. As shown in Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments increased 10% during the quarter. Despite the very weak industry demand, o",639,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America performance for the quarter. As shown in Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments increased 10% during the quarter. Despite the very weak industry demand, our ongoing business operations margin grew to 6.7% during the quarter, up from the 2.3% from the prior year. This is largely the result of our previously announced and fully implemented comp state price increases and an overall improved product price mix. It is important to note that our market share is up sequentially which clearly speaks to its success of our innovation to market place and our flawless execution of the price increases.
For materials continue to be a headwind first and we have announced an additional cost base price increase starting in July 1. In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiative are on track for all region. Good morning turning to Slide 11. Net sales of $2.2 billion increased 1% from last year due to overall unit volume decline. We saw our North America units have been down 7% in the first quarter which slightly ahead of the U.S. industry decline of 10%. Operating costs have reached $151 million versus the $59 million the previous year. All ongoing business operating profit was also $151 million as compared to $52 million in 2011, which means we nearly tripled our grade margin.
Turning to Slide 12, you can see just a few samples offering in all product launches. You also see a picture of our new Cleveland, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The facility officially opened earlier month, includes state-of-the-art production facility distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. As demonstrated by our improved market share, despite our cost base price increases, it is clear that our innovation is a competitive advantage and key to our success in the marketplace.
We have a strong cane of new product innovation throughout the year. I want to highlight a progress we've made against our business priorities for North America during quarter as you can see on Slide 13.
As I mentioned before, we have successfully implemented our cost base price increases, the cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing productivity programs will ramp up during the second half of the year and are in fact, will generate expected benefits. We have also able to leverage our strong product innovation during the quarter realizing that not only sequential margin improvements but sequential credits for share gain.
Now before I turn it back over to Mike, I want to take a moment to address the recent ITC decision 2 days on refrigerator antidumping petition.
We know the fact clearly demonstrated that refrigerator from South Korea and Mexico were being dumped in the United States market. And in March, the Department of Commerce confirmed that in fact bumping has occurred. An issue to find an antidumping accountability due to determination assigning both antidumping and counter-bating due to March. Obviously, we are extremely disappointed with the ITC decision and will explore every opportunity, including appeal to resolve a parent disconnect between Commerce's final determination that dumping is occurring and file IDC determination that this dumping is not in relation to the U.S. industry and our workers.
In addition and this is very important going forward, we will continue to monitor for a producer behavior in the marketplace. If we see a reversion to the dumping activities that prior to 2012, we will take all appropriate legal actions.
It's very important to know that this decision does not influence the actions that we took last December when we filed antidumping and counter-bating due to petitions from large from South Korea and Mexico. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operation."

We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the prior year period with appliance unit shipments up 2%. Excluding the impact in currency, sales increased 7%. We saw improved price mix across the region. There was strong demand for Q3 products which include washing machines, refrigerators and ranges, while it was previously discussed, we elected to move away from lower end, unprofitable microwave ovens and air conditioners. Strong sales and product price mix gains were partially offset by higher material cost and lower monetization of Brazilian BPX tax credits. As we discussed on the last call, the Brazilian government an appliance sales tax holiday in December. The program originally set to expire on March 31 was extended for an additional 90 days through June 30, 2012, as expected.
Irrespective however of the stimulus program, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Brazil and Latin American international business. Europe remains challenging during the quarter, with continued weak consumer demand across the euro zone. Our cost based price increases and cost reduction initiatives are expected to progressively yield margin improvement sequentially throughout the year.
In Asia, Q1 industry demand in India and China was lower than expected. China's economy grew at its weakest pace in nearly 3 years in the first quarter of 2012 and inflation in India continue to dampen demand. However, we continue to expect recovery throughout the year as we comp against easier numbers.
If you turn to Slide 16. You'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter totaled $121 million compared to $174 million in the prior year. Favorable product price mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, unfavorable currency and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $114 million compared to $108 million in the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 17. In the first quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $688 million which newly shipments down 4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. Operating profit of $5 million improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss but was down from last year -- prior year to $25 million.
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 18. Net sales decreased 3% during the quarter to $202 million, down from $208 million in the prior year period with unit shipments increasing 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. The region's operating profit was $9 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price mix and volume growth was more than offset by unfavorable currency and material costs.
Turning to Slide 19, you can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. In addition to the products you see here, our Bauknecht expanded into Hong Kong allowing us to reach consumers in super premium segment in that growing market. And in Latin America, we've launched the region's first premium front load laundry pair leveraging our New-Global laundry platform for wet and brand consumers.
And in India, starting in March, we are launching more than 150 new products during the year across 6 appliance categories. The largest launch in the region's history. The products with lower innovation, designs and features that consumers want and at price points that make the products accessible to every consumer segment.
In China, as you will see on Slide 20, we established a strategic alliance with the retailer, Suning. Expanding our ability to large numbers of consumers through a respected trade channel. As part of the strategic alliance, we have preferential assets to Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets throughout China and preferential assets that fast-growing market segments in China smaller but faster growing cities.
This relationship demonstrates our strong commitment to the China market, Suning's distribution network as well as its excellent reputation as a leading electrical appliance retailer in China, making it the ideal choice for this partnership, which is a key enabler to our China growth strategy to become the leading international appliance brand in China and grow our domestic sales to $1 million over the next several years.
Turning to Slide 21. You can see the progress of our international business made towards our operating priorities. While demand remains soft in some markets, we are beginning to see signs of growth returning for our business in emerging markets. Our margin expansion efforts are on track through improved price mix, productivity and realizing the committed restructuring benefits. And lastly, we are supporting our business with a strong year of innovation which is driving the growth and price mix improvements we are seeing across the company.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."

First let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full-year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing b",973,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full-year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. Free cash flow guidance was $100 million to $150 million with our ongoing business cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion. Our first quarter results are well unplanned to deliver annual guidance which we are reconfirming this morning.
You may recall that guidance reflected essentially flat industry growth for the year and was based on margin expansion due from price and mix improvement, restructuring benefits from our cost and capacity reduction programs, ongoing productivity which we expect during the second half of this year, the lost of material cost headwinds. And finally, we're increasing our marketing investment to support a significantly product innovation we're introducing this year.
As discussed on our last call, we expect annual ongoing business operating profit margin to be between 5.5% to 6%. On Slide 24, you'll note that our ongoing business operating profit margin essentially doubled from 2.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1 essentially at the bottom of our full-year range.
We're very pleased with our margin progression and remain confident in our guidance for the year.
On Slide 25, you'll note that for the quarter GAAP EPS was $1.17 per share compared to $2.17 last year.
It's very important to note that last year included $1.54 per share for BPX tax credits and the energy tax credit program, which was not extended this year. Our 2012 first quarter results reflect only $0.08 per share from the BPX tax credits. Adjusting for restructuring expense and the previously mentioned tax credits, our ongoing business operations delivered $1.41 per share, more than doubling from the $0.64 last year.
Slide 26 shows the drivers of our year-over-year ongoing business operations improvement, which was entirely driven by margin expansion. Price mix contributed approximately 4 points to our market expansion during the quarter. We expect strong year-over-year price mix for the first half of the year and will now begin to comp against last year's price increases during future quarters. Our cost and capacity reduction program is on track and contributed proximately 1.2 margin improvement. We remain confident in achieving the 200 million or 1 point of margin improvement this year as these benefits continue to build throughout the year. And additionally, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from this program in 2013.
We did generate approximately half a point of margin coming from normal productivity. Our productivity consistent of our project pipeline we'll build throughout the year and we expect to more than offset material headwinds during the second half of this year. Material headwinds have negatively impacted margins by approximately 2.5 points. As mentioned, we totally estimate headwinds to higher end of our previously $350 million range.
In summary, delivering a 5.3% ongoing business operations margin during the first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter of the year, puts us well on track to achieve our annual guidance of 5.5 points to 6 points. 
Along what we have discussed items. First, our effective tax rate was 27% which was consistent with our annual guidance of 26% to 29%. It's important to note that last year we benefited from $54 million of energy tax credits. Secondly, restructuring expense was $34 million, up significantly from last year. Slide 29 illustrates that we continue to expect the total expense of our restructuring programs to be approximately $500 million through 2013.
And as I previously mentioned, we are own track to deliver the $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefits in 2013. Thirdly, BPX tax credits included in our GAAP results was $7 million compared to $66 million last year.
The biggest driver of these increase was a tax rate program initiated by Brazilian government which reduced the amount of BPX credit we're able to monetize. The program which started December 1, 2011, was extended an additional 3 months through June 30, 2012. 
During our last call we told you that our 2012 guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BPX credits compared to $266 million recognized in 2011. We modeled our 2012 guidance similar to the government's previous program which was extended to 9 months. Should the current 7 month program not be extended to 9 months, we will be able to monetize additional credits of approximately $45 million.
And just a general reminder, both restructuring expense in BPX credits are excluded from our ongoing this is operation result in guidance along with last year's energy tax credits and one-time items.
We reach to our free cash flow results on Slide 30. As expected, we reported a free cash flow use of $515 million for the full-year compared to a use of $336 million last year. These results include the final installment of $275 million related to the Brazilian collection dispute. In comparison to last year, we also had higher pension contributions, high restructuring cash outlays and significantly lower monetization of BPX tax rates.
Slide 31 depicts the underlying cash flow for operations after taking account the short term cash requirements. As you can see, we are driving approvals of our cash flow ongoing business operations as we largely report our legacy related abilities behind us this year. Overall, working capital is at a first quarter record low driven largely by lower inventory levels.
Slide 32, you will see that our 2012 cash priorities remain in the Pacific we capital expenditures in pension distributions dividends that I presume mentioned the remaining liabilities which be larger be behind us after this year and debt payment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Long-term, we remain confident the opportunities that we see to grow the business as we've outlined to Slide 35.

First of all your, unit as we reported units were down on the industry shipments 10%, which is slightly worse than expected.

So true [indiscernible] I thought we might. And in addition, you compare to previous industry inventory build, so you got to it take that into account.

So again, I stick by what we said, I don't think that pricing is had any impact on the consumer demand in this moment. On the first comment of the ITC. Mark, really clearly laid out our position. I only reinforce 2 points. One is the Department of Commerce conclusively determine there is dumping taking place in this marketplace from those markets, and a large magnitude particularly for our type of industry. The ITC rule was determined whether that was the cause of material damages to the industry, and in this case Whirlpool, and it is unexplainable to us how that conclusion could have been reached but we will not have the public opinion for probably another several weeks anyway.

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before you begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

At you saw earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Overall, we had a very strong start to the year as we benefited from our margin expansion efforts and our continued innovation investment. Our previously announced and implemented cost-based price actions, along with our cost-reduction initiatives, have put us on track to deliver our full year 2012 guidance. We have particularly strong operating performance in our North America and Latin America regions. In fact, in North America, ongoing operating business profits tripled year-over-year despite a 10% industry unit decline in demand.
I think the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for our innovative new product launches, which, overall, is driving very positive mix in many of our key markets. And despite the weaker-than-expected demand, our working capital in the first quarter is at a record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.
As a reminder, during our last call, we clearly defined what we call our ongoing business operational performance, which excludes unusual items, restructuring expense and tax credits. You can see our results for the quarter on Slide 6.
Sales were relatively flat despite weaker appliance demand, unfavorable currency and the effects of a lower BPX monetization. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.41 a share compared to $0.64 a year ago with our operating earnings more than double. And we saw year-over-year improvements in our free cash flow from business operations, which we'll discuss in detail later.
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see a summary of our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world for the year. However, in different parts of the world, we've seen a slower start to the year, but overall, globally, we see the same demand levels as we originally forecasted. 
In North America, we're currently seeing demand trending towards the lower end of our previous flat to plus 3% range. In Latin America, in part due to a continuous -- continuation of the Brazilian tax holiday program, combined with strong underlying economic fundamentals both in Brazil and other Latin American countries, after a very good first quarter, we see demand at the high end of our plus 2% to plus 5% range for the region for the year.
In Europe, we continue to forecast an industry decline ranging from minus 2% to minus 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. 
And finally, in Asia, we expect our full year demand in Asia to be at the lower end of our previously stated plus 2% to plus 4% after a relatively weak demand level in Q1.
I'll now turn to Slide 8, which shows our key business drivers for the year and how they are tracking versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned, overall, we continue to benefit from an already announced global cost base price increases. As we progress through the year, we will comp against the 2011 global price increases, so we do expect price/mix to continue to be a positive driver of margin expansion throughout the year, but at a lesser rate than we saw in the first quarter. Our restructuring costs and capacity initiatives are on track and these benefits will ramp up and accelerate throughout the year in 2012. In addition, we will continue to bring the cadence of strong innovation which will contribute to the overall improvement in our revenue growth, our mix and overall operating profit.
And finally, we estimate raw material inflation to be at the higher end of our $300 million to $350 million range, but we still expect to more than offset all this inflation through strong productivity benefits, which will ramp up in the second half of the year. 
So overall, we're pleased with the very good start in the first quarter. We are, as we look out through the rest of the year, we believe we are on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year.
At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for an update on our North America operations."

As shown on Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments increased 10% during the quarter. Despite a very weak industry demand, our ongoing business operations margin grew to 6.7% during the quarter, up from the 2.3% of the prior year. This is largely the result of our previously announced and fully implemented cost-based price increases and an overall improved product price/mix. 
It is important to note that our market share is up sequentially, which clearly speaks to the success of our innovation in the market place and our flawless execution of the price increases.
Raw materials continued to be a headwind for us, and we have announced an additional cost base price increase effective July 1. 
In addition, our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives are on track for the region. 
Turning to Slide 11. Net sales of $2.2 billion decreased 1% from last year driven by an overall unit volume decline. We saw our North America units shipments down 7% in the first quarter, which is slightly ahead of the U.S. industry decline of 10%. 
Operating profit reached $151 million versus the $59 million in previous year. Ongoing business operating profit was also $151 million as compared to $52 million in 2011, which means we nearly tripled our operating margin.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see just a few examples of our innovative cooking product launches. You also see a picture of our new Cleveland, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The facility officially opened early this month and includes a state-of-the-art production facility and distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. 
As demonstrated by our improving market share, despite our cost base price increases, it is clear that our innovation is a competitive advantage and key to our success in the marketplace.
We have a strong cadence of new product innovation planned throughout the year. 
I want to highlight the progress we've made against our business priorities for North America during the quarter as you can see on Slide 13. As mentioned before, we have successfully implemented our cost base price increases, the cost and capacity reduction initiatives as well as our ongoing productivity programs will ramp up during the second half of the year and are, in fact, will generate the expected benefits. We were also able to leverage our strong product innovation during the quarter, realizing not only sequential margin improvements but sequential share gains.
Now before I turn it back over to Mike, I want to take a moment to address the recent ITC decision related to our bottom-mount refrigerator antidumping petition.
We know the fact clearly demonstrated that bottom-mount refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico were being dumped in the United States market. And in March, the Department of Commerce confirmed that, in fact, dumping has occurred, and issued a final antidumping and countervailing duty determination, assigning both antidumping and countervailing duty margins . Obviously, we are extremely disappointed with the ITC decision and we will explore every option, including appeal to resolve the apparent disconnect between Commerce's final determination that dumping is occurring and the final ITC determination that these dump imports did not cause injury to the U.S. industry and their workers.
In addition, and this is very important, going forward, we will continue to monitor foreign producer behavior in the marketplace. If we see a reversion to the dumping activities that prevailed prior to 2012, we will take all appropriate legal actions.
It's very important to know that this decision does not influence the actions that we took last December when we filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions for large residential clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

You'll find an overview of our international business performance on Slide 15. We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil.

We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments up 2%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales, increased 7%. We saw improved price/mix across the region. There was strong demand for T3 products, which include washing machines, refrigerators and ranges. While it was previously discussed, we elected to move away from lower end, unprofitable microwave ovens and air conditioners. Strong sales and product price/mix gains were partially offset by higher material costs and lower monetization of Brazilian BPX tax credits. 
As we discussed on the last call, the Brazilian government an appliance sales tax holiday in December. The program, originally set to expire on March 31, was extended for an additional 90 days through June 30, 2012, as expected. Irrespective, however, of the stimulus program, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Brazil and Latin American international business. 
Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. Our cost-based price increases and cost-reduction initiatives are expected to progressively yield margin improvement sequentially throughout the year.
In Asia, Q1 industry demand in India and China was lower than expected. China's economy grew at its weakest pace in nearly 3 years in the first quarter of 2012, and inflation in India continued to dampen demand. However, we continue to expect recovery throughout the year as we comp against easier numbers.
If you turn to Slide 16. You'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter totaled $121 million compared to $174 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, unfavorable currency and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $114 million compared to $108 million in the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 17. In the first quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $688 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. Operating profit of $5 million improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss, but was down from last year -- prior year of $25 million.
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 18. Net sales decreased 3% during the quarter to $202 million, down from $208 million in the prior year period with unit shipments increasing 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. The region's operating profit was $9 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume growth was more than offset by unfavorable currency and material costs.
Turning to Slide 19. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. In addition to the products you see here, our Bauknecht brand expanded into Hong Kong allowing us to reach consumers in super premium segment in that growing market. And in Latin America, we've launched the region's first premium front-load laundry pair leveraging our new global laundry platform for Brastemp brand consumers.
And in India, starting in March, we are launching more than 150 new products during the year across 6 appliance categories, the largest launch in the region's history. The products deliver innovation, designs and features that consumers want and at price points that make the products accessible to every consumer segment.
In China, as you will see on Slide 20, we established a strategic alliance with the retailer, Suning, expanding our ability to large numbers of consumers through a respected trade channel. As part of the strategic alliance, we have preferential access to Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets throughout China and preferential access to fast-growing market segments in China's smaller but faster-growing cities. This relationship demonstrates our strong commitment to the China market. Suning's distribution network, as well as its excellent reputation as a leading electrical appliance retailer in China, make it the ideal choice for this partnership, which is a key enabler to our China growth strategy to become the leading international appliance brand in China and grow our domestic sales to $1 billion over the next several years.
Turning to Slide 21. You'll see the progress our international business made towards our operating priorities. While demand remains soft in some markets, we are beginning to see signs of growth returning for our business in emerging markets. Our margin expansion efforts are on track through improved price mix, productivity and realizing the committed restructuring benefits. 
And lastly, we are supporting our business with a strong year of innovation, which is driving the growth and price/ mix improvements we are seeing across the company.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,204536968,290567,"Whirlpool Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoi",997,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. Free cash flow guidance was $100 million to $150 million with our ongoing business cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion. Our first quarter results are well on plan to deliver annual guidance, which we are reconfirming this morning.
You may recall that guidance reflected essentially flat industry growth for the year and was based on margin expansion, driven from price and mix improvement; restructuring benefits from our costs and capacity reduction programs; ongoing productivity, which we expect during the second half of this year; the loss of material cost headwinds; and finally, we are increasing our marketing investment to support a significant new product innovation we're introducing this year.
As we discussed on our last call, we expect annual ongoing business operating profit margin to be between 5.5% to 6%. On Slide 24, you'll note that our ongoing business operating profit margin essentially doubled from 2.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1, essentially at the bottom of our full year range.
We are very pleased with our margin progression and remain confident in our guidance for the year.
On Slide 25, you'll note that for the quarter, GAAP EPS was $1.17 per share compared to $2.17 last year.
It's very important to note that last year included $1.54 per share for BPX tax credits and the energy tax credit program, which was not extended this year. Our 2012 first quarter results reflect only $0.08 per share from the BPX tax credits. Adjusting for restructuring expense and the previously mentioned tax credits, our ongoing business operations delivered $1.41 per share, more than doubling from the $0.64 last year.
Slide 26 shows the drivers of our year-over-year ongoing business operations improvement, which was entirely driven by margin expansion. Price mix contributed approximately 4 points to our market expansion during the quarter. We expect strong year-over-year price mix for the first half of the year and will begin to comp against last year's price increases during future quarters. 
Our cost and capacity reduction program is on track and contributed proximately 1 to margin improvement. We remain confident in achieving the $200 million or 1 point of margin improvement this year as these benefits continue to build throughout the year. And additionally, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from this program in 2013.
We did generate approximately 0.5 point of margin from normal productivity. Our productivity, consistent with our project pipeline, will build throughout the year and we expect to more than offset material headwinds during the second half of this year. Material headwinds negatively impacted margins by approximately 2.5 points. And as Jeff mentioned, we currently estimate headwinds to meet the higher end of our previous 3 to 3.5 -- $350 million range.
In summary, delivering a 5.3% ongoing business operations margin during the first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter of the year, puts us well on track to achieving our annual guidance of 5.5 points to 6 points. 
I want to briefly discuss 3 items. First, our effective tax rate was 27%, which was consistent with our annual guidance of 26% to 29%. And It's important to note that last year we benefited from $54 million of energy tax credits. Secondly, restructuring expense was $34 million, up significantly from last year. Slide 29 illustrates that we continue to expect the total expense of our restructuring programs to be approximately $500 million through 2013. And as I previously mentioned, we are own track to deliver the $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefits in 2013. Thirdly, BPX tax credits, included in our GAAP results, was $7 million compared to $66 million last year.
The biggest driver of these decrease was a tax credit program initiated by the Brazilian government, which reduced the amount of BPX credit we were able to monetize. The program, which started December 1, 2011, was extended an additional 3 months through June 30, 2012. 
During our last call, we told you that our 2012 guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BPX credits compared to 260 million -- $266 million recognized in 2011. We modeled our 2012 guidance similar to the government's previous program, which was extended to 9 months. Should the current 7-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits of approximately $45 million.
And just a general reminder, both restructuring expense and BPX credits are excluded from our ongoing business operation results and guidance, along with the last year's energy tax credits and other onetime items.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 30. As expected, we reported a free cash flow use of $515 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $336 million last year. These results include the final installment of $275 million related to the Brazilian collection dispute. In comparison to last year, we also had higher pension contributions, higher restructuring cash outlays and significantly lower monetization of BPX tax credits.
Slide 31 depicts the underlying cash flow through our operations after taking to account the short-term cash requirements. As you can see, we are driving improvements in our cash flow from ongoing business operations as we largely put our legacy legal abilities behind us this year. Overall, working capital is at a first quarter record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.
On Slide 32, you will see that our 2012 cash priorities remain funding business including capital expenditures and pension contributions. Dividends, as I've previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities, which will largely be behind us after this year, and debt repayment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

First of all, unit -- as we reported, units were down on the industry shipments, 10%, which is slightly worse than we expected. At the same time, you got to also note that during that quarter, we saw quite a bit of trade inventory reduction, which is, as you know, difficult to peg, but I would peg it at around 3%. So true sell-through, probably minus 7%. And in addition, if you compare to previous [indiscernible] industry inventory build, so you got to take that into account. With that in mind, we still forecast the full year industry shipments to be roughly flat, which is at the low end of our previous guidance. So that's the unit side. On the pricing, our pricing stuck, but it's more important even in the quality of our pricing because it was not just like-to-like, we also had very strong mix in our Q1 performance and we see that continuing.

Clearly, last year was a setback given the environment, but as we announced last October, we took very strong actions with our #1 priority being margin expansions. So this year, based on what we gave in the guidance and what we've outlined in our plans we expect to be at 5.5% to 6% operating profit this year. We, also, as a reminder, will have next year approximately $200 billion, which is roughly a full point restructuring benefit in addition to what we get there. And we will continue investing in innovation. We will continue to do the things that we need to do to drive mix and expand margins. But we reiterate, it was our expectations that we'd get to the 8% plus by 2014. Now shorter term, your question, I'll turn it over to Larry."

First of all, on the questions to why it's more -- it's not instant recovery. I would argue without being too much [indiscernible], the rational factors when you look at housing affordability, mortgage rates, housing costs would speak in favor of a faster recovery of the demand, what stands in the way is still consumer confidence, which is still lagging behind. We do not expect a major recovery on consumer confidence until the end of the year. And that will be the center point in terms of when see the industry improving. So I think it's already in the back to consumer confidence, not necessarily the rational factors. They would clearly speak in favor of a faster recovery. The second point of your question, pricing versus demand. As Jeff mentioned before, we're basing our extension in all replacement markets, which historically has been and is now also confirmed is not elastic to pricing. It's just not -- I mean if you're a replacement consumer, you buy and that is not necessarily driven by issuance of 10% discount at all."

So again, I stick by what we said. I don't think pricing has had any impact on consumer demand in this moment. On the first comment of the ITC, Marc really clearly laid out our position. I'd only reinforce 2 points: one is the Department of Commerce conclusively determined there is dumping taking place in this marketplace from those markets and a large magnitude, particularly for our type of industry. The ITC rule was determined whether that was caused material damages to the industry, and in this case Whirlpool, and it is unexplainable to us how that conclusion could have been reached and -- but we will not have the public opinion for probably another several weeks anyway.

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before you begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Overall, we had a very strong start to the year as we benefited from our margin expansion efforts and our continued innovation investment. Our previously announced and implemented cost-based price actions, along with our cost-reduction initiatives, have put us on track to deliver our full year 2012 guidance. We have particularly strong operating performance in our North America and Latin America regions. In fact, in North America, ongoing operating business profits tripled year-over-year despite a 10% industry unit decline in demand.
I think the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for our innovative new product launches, which, overall, is driving very positive mix in many of our key markets. And despite the weaker-than-expected demand, our working capital in the first quarter is at a record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.
As a reminder, during our last call, we clearly defined what we call our ongoing business operational performance, which excludes unusual items, restructuring expense and tax credits. You can see our results for the quarter on Slide 6.
Sales were relatively flat despite weaker appliance demand, unfavorable currency and the effects of a lower BEFIEX monetization. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.41 a share compared to $0.64 a year ago with our operating earnings more than double. And we saw year-over-year improvements in our free cash flow from business operations, which we'll discuss in detail later.
Turning to Slide 7. You'll see a summary of our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world for the year. However, in different parts of the world, we've seen a slower start to the year, but overall, globally, we see the same demand levels as we originally forecasted. 
In North America, we're currently seeing demand trending towards the lower end of our previous flat to plus 3% range. In Latin America, in part due to a continuous -- continuation of the Brazilian tax holiday program, combined with strong underlying economic fundamentals both in Brazil and other Latin American countries, after a very good first quarter, we see demand at the high end of our plus 2% to plus 5% range for the region for the year.
In Europe, we continue to forecast an industry decline ranging from minus 2% to minus 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. 
And finally, in Asia, we expect our full year demand in Asia to be at the lower end of our previously stated plus 2% to plus 4% after a relatively weak demand level in Q1.
I'll now turn to Slide 8, which shows our key business drivers for the year and how they are tracking versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned, overall, we continue to benefit from the already announced global cost-based price increases. As we progress through the year, we will comp against the 2011 global price increases, so we do expect price/mix to continue to be a positive driver of margin expansion throughout the year, but at a lesser rate than we saw in the first quarter. Our restructuring costs and capacity initiatives are on track and these benefits will ramp up and accelerate throughout the year in 2012. In addition, we will continue to bring the cadence of strong innovation which will contribute to the overall improvement in our revenue growth, our mix and overall operating profit.
And finally, we estimate raw material inflation to be at the higher end of our $300 million to $350 million range, but we still expect to more than offset all this inflation through strong productivity benefits, which will ramp up in the second half of the year. 
So overall, we're pleased with the very good start in the first quarter. We are -- as we look out through the rest of the year, we believe we are on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year.
At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for an update on our North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments decreased 10% during the quarter. Despite a very weak industry deman",642,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments decreased 10% during the quarter. Despite a very weak industry demand, our ongoing business operations margin grew to 6.7% during the quarter, up from the 2.3% in the prior year. This is largely the result of our previously announced and fully implemented cost-based price increases and an overall improved product price/mix. 
It is important to note that our market share is up sequentially, which clearly speaks to the success of our innovation in the marketplace and our flawless execution of the price increases. Raw materials continued to be a headwind for us, and we have announced an additional cost-based price increase effective July 1. In addition, our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives are on track for the region. 
Turning to Slide 11. Net sales of $2.2 billion decreased 1% from last year driven by an overall unit volume decline. We saw our North America unit shipments down 7% in the first quarter, which is slightly ahead of the U.S. industry decline of 10%. Operating profit reached $151 million versus the $59 million in the previous year. Ongoing business operating profit was also $151 million as compared to $52 million in 2011, which means we nearly tripled our operating margin.
Turning to Slide 12. You can see just a few examples of our innovative cooking product launches. You also see a picture of our new Cleveland, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The facility officially opened early this month and includes a state-of-the-art production facility and distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. 
As demonstrated by our improving market share, despite our cost-based price increases, it is clear that our innovation is a competitive advantage and key to our success in the marketplace. We have a strong cadence of new product innovation planned throughout the year. 
I want to highlight the progress we've made against our business priorities for North America during the quarter as you can see on Slide 13. As mentioned before, we have successfully implemented our cost-based price increases, but the cost and capacity reduction initiatives as well as our ongoing productivity programs will ramp up during the second half of the year and are on track to generate the expected benefits. We were also able to leverage our strong product innovation during the quarter, realizing not only sequential margin improvements but sequential share gains.
Now before I turn it back over to Mike, I want to take a moment to address the recent ITC decision related to our bottom-mount refrigerator antidumping petition. We know the fact clearly demonstrated that bottom-mount refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico were being dumped in the United States market. And in March, the Department of Commerce confirmed that, in fact, dumping has occurred, and issued a final antidumping and countervailing duty determination, assigning both antidumping and countervailing duty margins. Obviously, we are extremely disappointed with the ITC decision and we will explore every option, including appeal to resolve the apparent disconnect between Commerce's final determination that dumping is occurring and the final ITC determination that these dump imports did not cause injury to the U.S. industry and their workers.
In addition, and this is very important, going forward, we will continue to monitor foreign producer behavior in the marketplace. If we see a reversion to the dumping activities that prevailed prior to 2012, we will take all appropriate legal actions. It's very important to know that this decision does not influence the actions that we took last December when we filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions for large residential clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

You'll find an overview of our international business performance on Slide 15. We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil.

We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments up 2%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased 7%. We saw improved price/mix across the region. There was strong demand for T3 products, which include washing machines, refrigerators and ranges. While it was previously discussed, we elected to move away from lower-end, unprofitable microwave ovens and air conditioners. Strong sales and product price/mix gains were partially offset by higher material costs and lower monetization of Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits. 
As we discussed on the last call, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. The program, originally set to expire on March 31, was extended for an additional 90 days through June 30, 2012, as expected. Irrespective, however, of the stimulus program, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Brazil and Latin American international business. Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. Our cost-based price increases and cost-reduction initiatives are expected to progressively yield margin improvement sequentially throughout the year. In Asia, Q1 industry demand in India and China was lower than expected. China's economy grew at its weakest pace in nearly 3 years in the first quarter of 2012, and inflation in India continued to dampen demand. However, we continue to expect recovery throughout the year as we comp against easier numbers.
If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter totaled $121 million compared to $174 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, unfavorable currency and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $114 million compared to $108 million in the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 17. In the first quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $688 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. Operating profit of $5 million improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss, but was down from last year -- prior year of $25 million.
Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 18. Net sales decreased 3% during the quarter to $202 million, down from $208 million in the prior year period with unit shipments increasing 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. The region's operating profit was $9 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume growth was more than offset by unfavorable currency and material costs.
Turning to Slide 19. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. In addition to the products you see here, our Bauknecht brand expanded into Hong Kong, allowing us to reach consumers in super premium segment in that growing market. And in Latin America, we've launched the region's first premium front-load laundry pair leveraging our new global laundry platform for Brastemp brand consumers.
And in India, starting in March, we are launching more than 150 new products during the year across 6 appliance categories, the largest launch in the region's history. The products deliver innovation, designs and features that consumers want and at price points that make the products accessible to every consumer segment.
In China, as you will see on Slide 20, we established a strategic alliance with the retailer, Suning, expanding our ability to large numbers of consumers through a respected trade channel. As part of the strategic alliance, we have preferential access to Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets throughout China and preferential access to fast-growing market segments into China's smaller but faster-growing cities. This relationship demonstrates our strong commitment to the China market. Suning's distribution network, as well as its excellent reputation as a leading electrical appliance retailer in China, make it the ideal choice for this partnership, which is a key enabler to our China growth strategy to become the leading international appliance brand in China and grow our domestic sales to $1 billion over the next several years.
Turning to Slide 21. You'll see the progress our international business made towards our operating priorities. While demand remains soft in some markets, we are beginning to see signs of growth returning for our business in emerging markets. Our margin expansion efforts are on track through improved price mix, productivity and realizing the committed restructuring benefits. And lastly, we are supporting our business with a strong year of innovation, which is driving the growth and price/mix improvements we are seeing across the company.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."

First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoi",998,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. Free cash flow guidance was $100 million to $150 million with our ongoing business cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion. Our first quarter results are well on plan to deliver annual guidance, which we are reconfirming this morning.
You may recall that guidance reflected essentially flat industry growth for the year and was based on margin expansion, driven from price and mix improvement; restructuring benefits from our costs and capacity reduction programs; ongoing productivity, which we expect during the second half of this year; the loss of material cost headwinds; and finally, we are increasing our marketing investment to support a significant new product innovation we're introducing this year.
As we discussed on our last call, we expect annual ongoing business operating profit margin to be between 5.5% to 6%. On Slide 24, you'll note that our ongoing business operating profit margin essentially doubled from 2.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1, essentially at the bottom of our full year range. We are very pleased with our margin progression and remain confident in our guidance for the year.
On Slide 25, you'll note that for the quarter, GAAP EPS was $1.17 per share compared to $2.17 last year. It's very important to note that last year included $1.54 per share for BEFIEX tax credits and the energy tax credit program, which was not extended this year. Our 2012 first quarter results reflect only $0.08 per share from the BEFIEX tax credits. Adjusting for restructuring expense and the previously mentioned tax credits, our ongoing business operations delivered $1.41 per share, more than doubling from the $0.64 last year.
Slide 26 shows the drivers of our year-over-year ongoing business operations improvement, which was entirely driven by margin expansion. Price/mix contributed approximately 4 points to our margin expansion during the quarter. We expect strong year-over-year price mix for the first half of the year and will begin to comp against last year's price increases during future quarters. Our cost and capacity reduction program is on track and contributed proximately 1 point to margin improvement. We remain confident in achieving the $200 million or 1 point of margin improvement this year as these benefits continue to build throughout the year. And additionally, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from this program in 2013.
We did generate approximately 0.5 point of margin improvement from normal productivity. Our productivity, consistent with our project pipeline, will build throughout the year and we expect to more than offset material headwinds during the second half of this year. Material headwinds negatively impacted margins by approximately 2.5 points. And as Jeff mentioned, we currently estimate headwinds to hit the higher end of our previous 3 to 3.5 -- $350 million range. In summary, delivering a 5.3% ongoing business operations margin during the first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter of the year, puts us well on track to achieving our annual guidance of 5.5 points to 6 points. 
I wanted to briefly discuss 3 items. First, our effective tax rate was 27%, which was consistent with our annual guidance of 26% to 29%. And It's important to note that last year, we benefited from $54 million of energy tax credits. Secondly, restructuring expense was $34 million, up significantly from last year. Slide 29 illustrates that we continue to expect the total expense of our restructuring program to be approximately $500 million through 2013. And as I previously mentioned, we are own track to deliver the $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefits in 2013. Thirdly, BEFIEX tax credits, included in our GAAP results, was $7 million compared to $66 million last year. The biggest driver of this decrease was a tax break program initiated by the Brazilian government, which reduces the amount of BEFIEX credit we are able to monetize. The program, which started December 1, 2011, was extended an additional 3 months through June 30, 2012. 
During our last call, we told you that our 2012 guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to 260 million -- $266 million recognized in 2011. We modeled our 2012 guidance similar to the government's previous program, which was extended to 9 months. Should the current 7-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits of approximately $45 million. And just as a general reminder, both restructuring expense and BEFIEX credits are excluded from our ongoing business operation results and guidance, along with last year's energy tax credits and other one-time items.
Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 30. As expected, we reported a free cash flow use of $515 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $336 million last year. These results include the final installment of $275 million related to the Brazilian collection dispute. In comparison to last year, we also had higher pension contributions, higher restructuring cash outlays and significantly lower monetization of BEFIEX tax credits.
Slide 31 depicts the underlying cash flow through our operations after taking to account these short-term cash requirements. As you can see, we are driving improvements in our cash flow from ongoing business operations as we largely put our legacy legal liabilities behind us this year. Overall, working capital is at a first quarter record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.
On Slide 32, you'll see that our 2012 cash priorities remain funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends; as I've previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities, which will largely be behind us after this year; and debt repayment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

As we reported, units were down on industry shipments, 10%, which is slightly worse than we expected. At the same time, you got to also know that during the quarter, we saw quite a bit of trade inventory reduction, which is, as you know, difficult to peg, but I would peg it at around 3%. So through sell-through about probably minus 7%. And in addition, if you compare to previous year quarter, there was industry inventory build. So you've got to take that into account. With that in mind, we still forecast the full year industry shipments to be roughly flat, which is at the low end of our previous guidance. So that's the unit side. On the pricing, our pricing stuck. But what is more important even is the quality of our pricing because it was not just like-for-like, we also had a very strong mix in our Q1 performance and we see that continuing.

First of all, on the question as to why it's more -- of more instant [ph] recovering.

We do not expect a major recovery of consumer confidence until the end of the year. And that will be the center point in terms of when see the industry improving. So I think it's already in the back of consumer confidence, not necessarily the rational factors. They would clearly speak in favor of a faster recovery.

As Jeff mentioned before, we're basing our intention in all replacement markets, which historically has been and is now also confirmed is not elastic to pricing.

I don't think pricing has had any impact on consumer demand in this market. On the first comment of the ITC, Marc really clearly laid out our position. I'd only reinforce 2 points. One is the Department of Commerce conclusively determined there is dumping taking place in this marketplace from those markets at a large magnitude, particularly for our type of industry. The ITC rule was determined whether that was cause of material damages to the industry, and in this case, Whirlpool.

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined in the beginning of the year, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance. Overall, I believe we executed well during the quarter and the first half of the year and our margin expansion initiatives remain on track. 
In total, these actions fully offset weaker than expected demand, unfavorable currency and material inflation during the quarter. Our North America and Latin America businesses continued to perform extremely well. In North America, our ongoing business operating profit more than doubled year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to realize the expected $200 million per year cost savings benefit this year. And we continue to see very good -- very strong price/mix improvement during the quarter, which has been enabled by our innovation, which is winning in the marketplace, our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is an $8 billion mix and our continued support of our brands to ramp up investments. 
Turning to Slide 6. Overall revenues for the quarter were up 3% excluding the impact of currency and BEFIEX, driven by strong product price and mix. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.55 per share compared with $0.81 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow significantly improved year-over-year from ongoing business operations. 
On Slide 7, you can clearly see our continued positive trend of price/mix and margin expansion. During the first half, we made very strong progress towards our full-year margin target. And we expect to improve our margins to 6% to 7% during the second half of the year and reach our full year operating profit margins up between 5.5% and 6%, in line with our original guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8. Globally, we now expect second-half industry demand to improve versus first half levels. We have revised several of our regional forecast on a full-year basis. Our full-year U.S. industry demand is now forecasted to be flat to down 2% for the year. In Latin America, the Brazilian tax holiday was extended through the end of August. And with this extension, combined with good underlying economic fundamentals throughout the region, we now expect demand growth to increase from our original guidance to a range of 5% to 7%. In Europe, we continue to see an industry decline for the year in the range of down 2% to down 5% for the full year. And of course, as you know, European markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are impacting consumer demand. 
We are managing our business accordingly with cost and previously announced price actions along with very disciplined inventory management in this weak demand environment. And finally, we now expect full-year unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up to 2%. 
Slide 9 shows our key business drivers for the year versus our original guidance. As I just outlined, demand was weak in the first half of the year and currencies were volatile and had a negative impact on operations. Raw material inflation was in line with our forecast and we continue to expect our range of $300 million to $350 million for the. However, if current raw material trends continue, we would expect this to move towards the lower end of the range. We continue to expect to fully offset all of these items with positive price/mix driven by innovation and improving productivity, which we fully expect in the second half of the year. As I mentioned, our restructuring cost asset reductions are on track and we will realize those benefits as they ramp up in the second half of the year. 
So overall, throughout the first half, we are on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance and we are reaffirming that guidance for the year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to talk about our North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the quarter. Starting on Slide 11, first of all, you see our revenues and margin for the region grew significantly during the quarter, as margin expansion into largely to our previously announced and fully implemented price increases and an overall improved price/mix, which has now been consistent with the trend from the past 4 quarters. 
In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are delivering benefits as expected for the region. And during the quarter, we saw a record working capital driven by aggressive inventory management. It means we took down production volumes which had a negative impact on profitability. 
Turning to Slide 12. You see net sales of $2.5 billion increase 4% from last year, driven by favorable product price and mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $186 million, which more than doubled as compared to $76 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up more than 4 points year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 13, you can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The cooking products you see are just a couple of examples of how we are growing our premium cooking business. Earlier this year, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland, Tennessee to continue to provide the world's most innovative cooking products, including ranges, opens and cooktops. 
Turning over to Slide 14. Today, we're providing a perspective in the second quarter results, it remains imported to highlight significant opportunity for our businesses underlying industry demand start slowly improve. Today, demand is at recessionary low levels, and yet we were able to restore operating margins at 8%. And yes, we expect only a relatively modest demand growth in the second half. However, we are beginning to see some early consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. Obviously, with operating margins now already at 8%, there is significant opportunity once demand returns to a more normal level. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations."
314515,213795216,329201,"Whirlpool Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses,",710,"Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses, as we continue to launch consumer relevant innovations in every product category around the world. Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We took aggressive actions during the quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives for the region are on track, and when combined with previously announced cost-based price increases, are expected to deliver sequential margin improvements and a return to profitability in the second half and into 2013, although the demand environment remains uncertain. 
During the quarter, we saw volatile movements in the global currency market, particularly in Brazil and India. We continued our disciplined approach to inventory management and we expect to see some improvement in emerging market demand trends going forward. 
If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% on slightly higher volumes. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. Favorable product price and mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $101 million and approximately 9% of sales compared to $87 million and approximately 7% of sales in the prior-year period. 
Turning to Slide 18. As we previously discussed, we have focused on higher margin products in Brazil. As you can see illustrated here, excluding less profitable category, in this case microwave ovens, our T8 appliance units for our business in Brazil grew 7% versus last year. Our decision to shift the business has positively impacted price and mix and profit during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 18% year-over-year to $692 million with unit shipments down 7% compared to the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region had an operating loss of $26 million, down from the $20 million profit in the prior-year period. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was more than offset by unfavorable country mix, volatile currency and significant production takeout to adjust for margin demand and reduce our inventory levels. Today, inventories are in good shape and we do not expect that to be a headwind going forward as long as demand remains at current levels. We also continue to execute our restructuring plan, and we expect that our actions will allow us to return to profitability in the second half. 
Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales decreased 7% during the quarter to $241 million, down from $257 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 6%. The region's operating profit of $14 million improved sequentially and was essentially flat to the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and consumer preference for our new product launches, particularly in India, was offset by volatile currency and unfavorable material cost. In local currency, India achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter, and this confirms that our consumer relevant innovations is winning in the marketplace. 
Turning to Slide 21. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. These products show just a glimpse of how we are advancing our global brand portfolio in more than 130 markets around the world. Finally, we continue to see tremendous growth potential in emerging markets where product penetration levels remain low, as you can see on Slide 22. Despite the temporary slowdown, we expect to see a return to growth in these emerging markets as more consumers are able to purchase appliances and benefit from the quality and convenience they provide. The potential in developing countries is tremendous if we consider the population and economic growth trends combined with these low penetration levels. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,213795216,329201,"Whirlpool Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. As you recall and as shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing",1133,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. As you recall and as shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. The first 6 months of the year, we have earned GAAP EPS of $2.60 per share, essentially the midpoint of annual guidance and ongoing business operations EPS of just under $3 per share. As you know, we do not provide quarterly earnings guidance. It's important to note, however, that our first half earning results are ahead of the plan we established entering the year. These results are driven by our ongoing operating profit margin, which is essentially doubled from the second half 2011. Our run rate continues to support the full year guidance we provided several months ago, which we are again reconfirming today. Our lower tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment, is offsetting the unfavorable currency impact on our business. Operationally, our EPS guidance for the year remains solid and unchanged. As you can see on Slide 25, we continue to expect 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the year, which translates into a 300 basis point improvement. With our first half results on plan and close to the low end of this range, we fully expect margins to continue improving during the second half of the year. 
Let me spend a minute on our year-over-year margin improvement. For the first half of the year, the drivers of our performance have been price/mix, which is up approximately 4 points and is currently tracking higher than original expectations. We continue to expect positive price/mix in the second half of the year. However, we will be copying [ph] prior year price increases. Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which continues to remain on plan. We expect benefits to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year. Material cost inflation was approximately $175 million in the first half. And given industry demand levels, we did take actions during the second quarter to reduce production to ensure inventories remain at appropriate levels. The production cuts negatively impacted our conversion productivity. 
As you can see on Slide 25, our second have margins are expected to be at between 6% to 7%. This sequential improvement is expected to be realized by the combination of improving productivity, given a solid midyear inventory position, higher volume in the second half of the year, productivity program ramp up and lower material headwinds, continued price/mix improvements from recent price increases. And finally second-half margins also benefited from higher benefits as well as seasonality of our portable business. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Page 26. Consistent with our expectations, we did have a cash outflow for the first half of the year of $540 million. It's important to note that current year cash flow includes the final installment of $275 million associated with the Brazilian collection dispute. 
We also note that adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved over last year's first half. Now we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow between $100 million and $150 million for the year. With legacy legal liabilities and the majority of our restructuring cash outlays behind us after this year, we are very well-positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow in the future. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on our second quarter results, which further solidified our full-year guidance as well as some general topics. But before I begin, as a  general reminder, Slide 36 and 37 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations results for 2012 and '11. 
Included in this table are second quarter adjustments to drive our ongoing business operations performance, removing the impact of restructuring expense, tax credits as well as the impacts from benefit plan gain and trust resolution investment impairment and adjustment to normalize the second quarter tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 27, let me make a couple of observations. While reported net sales declined 5%, it's important to note that net sales from constant currencies and excluding [indiscernible] were up more than 3%. Our ongoing business operations operating profit improved by over 40% driven primarily by positive price/mix and cost and capacity reduction initiatives. Very solid performance given lower industry demand, unfavorable currencies and higher material cost. 
On Slide 28, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, prior-year GAAP results included the Brazilian collection dispute and antitrust settlement, benefits from energy tax credits as well and significantly higher BEFIEX credits. These items are presented for your reference on Page 38. 
Second, regarding our 2012 rate in the first quarter, we reported GAAP rate of 27% for the second quarter and was 4% on a GAAP basis, which is lower than our full-year expectations and driven by a timing of our tax planning. We now expect our full-year tax rate to be 25%. For our ongoing business operations EPS, our second quarter tax rate is 22%. This reflects an adjustment to bring our first half tax rate to 25%. 
Slide 29 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program remains on track and there are no changes from previous guidance. We are on track to deliver $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million benefit in 2013. 
Let me now turn to the monetization of BEFIEX fax credit, where we monetized $2 million in credits compared to $79 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of June 30, $215 million credits remain. Given the most recent extension to August 31, we continue to expect to monetize $60 million to $80 million this year, unless the program will be extended for the third time. If the program would be extended to the end of 2012, we would expect to monetize $40 million to $50 million for the full year. 
One other item I'd like to note is on May 1, $350 million of 8% notes maturities will be repaid. On June 1, we completed a 10-year debt offering of $300 million of 4.7% notes. 
Before I close on Slide 30, I want to review our short-term cash flow priorities, which remain unchanged, funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contributions, dividends, as I previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy liabilities, which are largely behind us after this year and debt repayment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Let me sum up by saying that we are pleased with our execution of the strong actions to improve our operating margins for the first half of the year, and we are on track to achieve record year of margin expansion throughout our global business. And I think it's important to point out we are able to do this in a period where both North America and Europe are at or near recession lows in terms of demand, and Asia showed the weakest negative demand growth we've seen in many, many years. 
But I think looking forward, more in line with our strategy, there are many positives that we're starting to feel better about. We are positive about what we're seeing in the U.S. with housing trends.  We see a foundation beginning to form in that sector, which we think will benefit us over time. We do have significant future opportunities for our business in emerging economies such as China, India and the countries throughout Latin America. We continue to see improvements in price/mix driven by our leading global brand portfolio and best-in-class innovation in our product launches. And we do know that innovation sells in good markets and in difficult markets. We will accelerate and we are investing to accelerate our innovation in both existing core business and adjacent spaces to further accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. Our ability to expand our operating margins and the conclusion of the legal legacy liability payments position us very well to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year and going into 2013. So overall, we are positive about the progress we are making to continue to build our position as a strong, global brand and consumer products company.

A couple of things from an SG&A perspective, we did guide at the beginning of the year that we will have higher SG&A for the year. Part of that has to do with the higher benefits. The other part has to do with increased investments in advertising and consumer support. From a productivity perspective and the balance in the back half of the year, couple of things to keep in mind. One is that the second half volume for us historically and will be this year is higher volume. And we just mentioned, for the second quarter we took out a significant amount of production. So you don't have the same headwinds from a conversion perspective as you did in the first half. Our inventories are in very good shape. So we'll have higher volumes in the second half of the year. From a productivity perspective on some of the programs, our cost change programs ramp up during the year. We've got programs going within the distribution network. Material content is within cost change. So things like that are what kind of build throughout the year. And then along with that, we have restructuring we said more back end waited. So those are some of the things that help us improve our productivity in the second half of the year."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we're reaffirming our full year guidance. Overall, I believe we executed well during the quarter and the first half of the year, and our margin expansion initiatives remain on track. In total, these actions fully offset weaker than expected demand, unfavorable currency and material inflation during the quarter. 
Our North America and Latin America businesses continue to perform extremely well. In North America, our ongoing business operating profit more than doubled year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to realize the expected $200 million per year cost savings benefit this year. And we continue to see very good -- a very strong price/mix improvement during the quarter, which has been enabled by our innovation, which is winning in the marketplace; our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up our mix; and our continued support of our brands through ramped up investments. 
Turning to Slide 6. Overall revenues for the quarter were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency and BEFIEX, driven by strong product price and mix. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.55 per share compared with $0.81 in the prior year, and our underlying free cash flow significantly improved year-over-year from ongoing business operations. 
On Slide 7, you can clearly see our continued positive trend of both price/mix and margin expansion. During the first half, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin target. And we expect to improve our margins to 6% to 7% during the second half of the year and reach our full year operating profit margins of between 5.5% and 6% in line with our original guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8. Globally, we now expect second half industry demand to improve versus first half levels. We have revised several of our regional forecasts on a full year basis. Our full year U.S. industry demand is now forecasted to be flat to down 2% for the year. In Latin America, the Brazilian tax holiday was extended through the end of August. And with this extension, combined with good underlying economic fundamentals throughout the region, we now expect demand growth to increase from our original guidance to the range of 5% to 7%. 
In Europe, we continue to see an industry decline for the year in the range of down 2% to down 5% for the full year. And of course, as you know, the European markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are impacting consumer demand. 
We are managing our business accordingly with cost and previously announced price actions along with very disciplined inventory management in this weak demand environment. And finally, we now expect full year unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up to 2%. 
Slide 9 shows our key business drivers for the year versus our original guidance. As I just outlined, demand was weak in the first half of the year and currencies were volatile and had a negative impact on operations. Raw material inflation was in line with our forecast, and we continue to expect a range of $300 million to $350 million for the year. However, if current raw material trends continue, we would expect this to move towards the lower end of the range. 
We continue to expect to fully offset all of these items with positive price/mix, driven by our cadence of innovation and improving productivities, which we fully expect in the second half of the year. As I mentioned, our restructuring costs and capacity asset reductions are on track, and we will realize those benefits as they ramp up in the second half of the year. 
So overall, throughout the first half, we're on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance, and we're reaffirming that guidance for the year. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to talk about our North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the quarter. 
Starting on Slide 11. First of all, you see our revenues and margin for the region grew significantly during the quarter as margin expansion is due largely to our previously announced and fully implemented cost base price increases and an overall improved price/mix, which has been now a consistent trend for the past 4 quarters. 
In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are delivering benefits as expected for the region. And during the quarter, we saw a record working capital, driven by aggressive inventory management, which means we took down production volumes, which had a negative impact on profitability. 
Turning to Slide 12. You see net sales of $2.5 billion increase 4% from last year, driven by favorable product price and mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $186 million, which more than doubled as compared to $76 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up more than 4 points year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 13, you can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The cooking products you see are just a couple of examples of how we are growing our premium cooking business. Earlier this year, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland and Tennessee to continue to provide the world's most innovative cooking products, including ranges, ovens and cooktops. 
Turning over to Slide 14. By today, we are providing our perspective in second quarter results. It remains important to highlight the significant opportunity while our businesses' underlying industry demand start to slowly improve. Today, demand is at recessionary low levels, and yet we were able to restore operating margins at 8%. And yet, we expect only relatively modest demand growth in the second half. However, we are beginning to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. And obviously, with operating margins now already at 8%, there is significant opportunity once demand returns to more normal levels. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,213795216,329395,"Whirlpool Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses",713,"Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. 
Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We took aggressive actions during the quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives for the region are on track, and when combined with previously announced cost-based price increases, are expected to deliver sequential margin improvements and a return to profitability in the second half and into 2013, although the demand environment remains uncertain. 
During the quarter, we saw volatile movements in the global currency markets, particularly in Brazil and India. We continued our disciplined approach to inventory management, and we expect to see some improvement in emerging market demand trends going forward. 
If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% on slightly higher volumes. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. Favorable product price and mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $101 million and approximately 9% of sales compared to $87 million and approximately 7% of sales in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 18. As we previously discussed, we have focused on higher margin products in Brazil. As you can see illustrated here, excluding a less profitable category, in this case microwave ovens, our T8 appliance units for our business in Brazil grew 7% versus last year. Our decision to shift the business has positively impacted price and mix and profit during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 18% year-over-year to $692 million with unit shipments down 7% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region had an operating loss of $26 million, down from the $20 million profit in the prior year period. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was more than offset by unfavorable country mix, volatile currency and significant production takeout to adjust for market demand and reduce our inventory levels. 
Today, inventories are in good shape, and we do not expect that to be a headwind going forward as long as demand remains at current levels. We also continue to execute our restructuring plan, and we expect that our actions will allow us to return to profitability in the second half. 
Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales decreased 7% during the quarter to $241 million, down from $257 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 6%. The region's operating profit of $14 million improved sequentially and was essentially flat to the prior year. 
Overall, favorable product price/mix and consumer preference for our new product launches, particularly in India, was offset by volatile currency and unfavorable material cost. In local currency, India achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter, and this confirms that our consumer-relevant innovation is winning in the marketplace. 
Turning to Slide 21. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. These products show just a glimpse of how we are advancing our global brand portfolio in more than 130 markets around the world. 
Finally, we continue to see tremendous growth potential in emerging markets, where product penetration levels remain low as you can see on Slide 22. Despite the temporary slowdown, we expect to see a return to growth in these emerging markets as more consumers are able to purchase appliances and benefit from the quality and convenience they provide. The potential in developing countries is tremendous if we consider the population and economic growth trends combined with these low penetration levels. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."

First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing",1154,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. 
As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. For the first 6 months of the year, we have earned GAAP EPS of $2.60 per share, essentially the midpoint of annual guidance, and ongoing business operations EPS of just under $3 per share. 
As you know, we do not provide quarterly earnings guidance. It's important to note, however, that our first half earning results are ahead of the plan we established entering the year. These results are driven by our ongoing operating profit margin, which has essentially doubled from the second half 2011. Our run rate continues to support the full year guidance we've provided several months ago, which we are again reconfirming today. Our lower tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment, is offsetting the unfavorable currency impact on our business. Operationally, our EPS guidance for the year remains solid and unchanged. 
As you can see on Slide 25, we continue to expect 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the year, which translates into a 300-basis point improvement. With our first half results on plan and close to the low end of this range, we fully expect margins to continue improving during the second half of the year. 
Let me spend a minute on our year-over-year margin improvement. For the first half of the year, the drivers of our performance have been price/mix, which is up approximately 4 points and is currently tracking higher than original expectations. We continue to expect positive price/mix in the second half of the year. However, we will be comping against prior year price increases. 
Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which continues to remain on plan. We expect benefits to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year. 
Material cost inflation was approximately $175 million in the first half. And given industry demand levels, we did take actions during the second quarter to reduce production to ensure inventories remained at appropriate levels. The production cuts negatively impacted our conversion productivity. 
As you can see on Slide 25, our second half margins are expected to be, as Jeff said, between 6% to 7%. This sequential improvement is expected to be realized by the combination of improving productivity, given a solid midyear inventory position, higher volume in the second half of the year, productivity program ramp up and lower material headwinds, continued price/mix improvements from recent price increases. And finally second half margins will also benefit from higher restructuring benefits, as well as seasonality of our portables business. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Page 26, and consistent with our expectations, we did have a cash outflow for the first half of the year of $540 million. It's important to note that current year cash flow includes the final installment of $275 million associated with the Brazilian collection dispute. 
We also note that adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved over last year's first half. Now we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow between $100 million and $150 million for the year. With legacy legal liabilities and the majority of our restructuring cash outlays behind us after this year, we are very well positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow in the future. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on our second quarter results, which further solidified our full year guidance, as well as some general topics. But before I begin, as a  general reminder, Slide 36 and 37 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2012 and '11. Included in this table are second quarter adjustments to drive our ongoing business operations and performance, removing the impact of restructuring expense, BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from benefit plan curtailment gain, the antitrust resolution, investment impairment and adjustment to normalize the second quarter tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 27. Let me make a couple of observations. While reported net sales declined 5%, it's important to note that net sales from constant currencies and excluding BEFIEX credits were up more than 3%. Our ongoing business operations operating profit improved by over 40%, driven primarily by positive price/mix and cost and capacity reduction initiatives, a very solid performance given lower industry demand, unfavorable currencies and higher material cost. 
On Slide 28, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, prior year GAAP results included the Brazilian collection dispute and antitrust settlement, benefits from energy tax credits, as well as significantly higher BEFIEX credits. These items are presented for your reference on Page 38. 
Second, regarding our 2012 tax rate, in the first quarter, we reported an effective GAAP tax rate of 27%; for the second quarter, it was 4% on a GAAP basis, which is lower than our full year expectations and driven by a timing of our tax planning. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 25%. For our ongoing business operations EPS, our second quarter tax rate is 22%. Now this reflects an adjustment to bring our first half tax rate to 25%. 
Slide 29 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program remains on track, and there are no changes from previous guidance. We are on track to deliver $200 million in benefit in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013. 
Let me turn now to the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits, where we monetized $2 million in credits compared to $79 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of June 30, $215 million credits remain. Given the most recent extension to August 31, we continue to expect to monetize $60 million to $80 million this year, unless the program will be extended for a third time. If the program would be extended to the end of 2012, we would expect to monetize $40 million to $50 million for the full year. 
One other item I'd like to note is on May 1, $350 million of 8% notes matured and were repaid. On June 1, we completed a 10-year debt offering of $300 million of 4.7% notes. 
Before I close on Slide 30, I want to review our short-term cash flow priorities, which remain unchanged funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contribution; dividends, as I previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy liabilities, which are largely behind us after this year; and debt repayment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Let me sum up by saying that we are pleased with our execution of the strong actions to improve our operating margins for the first half of the year, and we are on track to achieve a record year of margin expansion throughout our global business. And I think it's important to point out that we're able to do this in a period where both in North America and Europe are at or near recession lows in terms of demand and Asia is showing -- showed the weakest negative demand growth we've seen in many, many years. 
But I think looking forward, more in line with our strategy, there are many positives that we're starting to feel better about. We are positive about what we're seeing in the U.S. with housing trends.  We're seeing a foundation beginning to form in that sector, which we think will benefit us over time. We do have significant future opportunities for our business in emerging economies such as China, India and the countries throughout Latin America. 
We continue to see improvements in price/mix driven by our leading global brand portfolio and best-in-class innovation in our product launches, and we do know that innovation sells in good markets and in difficult markets. We will accelerate and we are investing to accelerate our innovation in both existing core business and adjacent spaces to further accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. Our ability to expand our operating margins and the conclusion of the legal -- the legacy liability payments position us very well for generating strong free cash flow in the second half of the year and going into 2013. 
So overall, we're positive about the progress we're making to continue to build our position as a strong global brand and consumer products company. 
With that, I'm going to end the formal remarks and open up for Q&A."

And we get -- on our innovation projects, we do get margin i.e. mix upgrades from that.

And we just mentioned, for the second quarter, we took out a significant amount of production. So you don't have the same headwinds from a conversion perspective as you did in the first half. Our inventories are in very good shape, so we'll have higher volumes in the second half of the year. From a productivity perspective on some of the programs, our cost change programs ramp up throughout the year. We've got programs going within the distribution network. Material content is within cost change. So things like that are what kind of builds throughout the year. And then along with that, we have restructuring we said was more back end weighted. So those are some of the things that help us improve our productivity in the second half of the year."

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at the beginnin",700,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we're reaffirming our full year guidance. Overall, I believe we executed well during the quarter and the first half of the year, and our margin expansion initiatives remain on track. In total, these actions fully offset weaker than expected demand, unfavorable currency and material inflation during the quarter. 
Our North America and Latin America businesses continue to perform extremely well. In North America, our ongoing business operating profit more than doubled year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to realize the expected $200 million per year cost savings benefit this year. And we continue to see very good -- a very strong price/mix improvement during the quarter, which has been enabled by our innovation, which is winning in the marketplace; our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up our mix; and our continued support of our brands through ramped up investments. 
Turning to Slide 6. Overall revenues for the quarter were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency and BEFIEX, driven by strong product price and mix. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.55 per share compared with $0.81 in the prior year, and our underlying free cash flow significantly improved year-over-year from ongoing business operations. 
On Slide 7, you can clearly see our continued positive trend of both price/mix and margin expansion. During the first half, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin target. And we expect to improve our margins to 6% to 7% during the second half of the year and reach our full year operating profit margins of between 5.5% and 6% in line with our original guidance. 
Turning to Slide 8. Globally, we now expect second half industry demand to improve versus first half levels. We have revised several of our regional forecasts on a full year basis. Our full year U.S. industry demand is now forecasted to be flat to down 2% for the year. In Latin America, the Brazilian tax holiday was extended through the end of August. And with this extension, combined with good underlying economic fundamentals throughout the region, we now expect demand growth to increase from our original guidance to the range of 5% to 7%. 
In Europe, we continue to see an industry decline for the year in the range of down 2% to down 5% for the full year. And of course, as you know, the European markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are impacting consumer demand. 
We are managing our business accordingly with cost and previously announced price actions along with very disciplined inventory management in this weak demand environment. And finally, we now expect full year unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up 2%. 
Slide 9 shows our key business drivers for the year versus our original guidance. As I just outlined, demand was weak in the first half of the year and currencies were volatile and had a negative impact on operations. Raw material inflation was in line with our forecast, and we continue to expect a range of $300 million to $350 million for the year. However, if current raw material trends continue, we would expect this to move towards the lower end of the range. 
We continue to expect to fully offset all of these items with positive price/mix, driven by our cadence of innovation and improving productivities, which we fully expect in the second half of the year. As I mentioned, our restructuring costs and capacity asset reductions are on track, and we will realize those benefits as they ramp up in the second half of the year. 
So overall, throughout the first half, we're on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance, and we're reaffirming that guidance for the year. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to talk about our North America operations."

Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the quarter. 
Starting on Slide 11. First of all, you see our revenues and margin for the region grew significantly during the quarter as margin expansion is due largely to our previously announced and fully implemented cost base price increases and an overall improved price/mix, which has been now a consistent trend for the past 4 quarters. 
In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are delivering benefits as expected for the region. And during the quarter, we saw a record working capital, driven by aggressive inventory management, which means we took down production volumes, which had a negative impact on profitability. 
Turning to Slide 12. You see net sales of $2.5 billion increase 4% from last year, driven by favorable product price and mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $186 million, which more than doubled as compared to $76 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up more than 4 points year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 13, you can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The cooking products you see are just a couple of examples of how we are growing our premium cooking business. Earlier this year, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland and Tennessee to continue to provide the world's most innovative cooking products, including ranges, ovens and cooktops. 
Turning over to Slide 14. While today, we are providing our perspective in second quarter results. It remains important to highlight the significant opportunity while our businesses' underlying industry demand start to slowly improve. Today, demand is at recessionary low levels, and yet we were able to restore operating margins at 8%. And yet, we expect only relatively modest demand growth in the second half. However, we are beginning to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. And obviously, with operating margins now already at 8%, there is significant opportunity once demand returns to more normal levels. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."
314515,213795216,329649,"Whirlpool Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses",713,"Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. 
Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We took aggressive actions during the quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives for the region are on track, and when combined with previously announced cost-based price increases, are expected to deliver sequential margin improvements and a return to profitability in the second half and into 2013, although the demand environment remains uncertain. 
During the quarter, we saw volatile movements in the global currency markets, particularly in Brazil and India. We continued our disciplined approach to inventory management, and we expect to see some improvement in emerging market demand trends going forward. 
If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% on slightly higher volumes. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. Favorable product price and mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $101 million and approximately 9% of sales compared to $87 million and approximately 7% of sales in the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 18. As we previously discussed, we have focused on higher margin products in Brazil. As you can see illustrated here, excluding a less profitable category, in this case microwave ovens, our T8 appliance units for our business in Brazil grew 7% versus last year. Our decision to shift the business has positively impacted price and mix and profit during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. In the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 18% year-over-year to $692 million with unit shipments down 7% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region had an operating loss of $26 million, down from the $20 million profit in the prior year period. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was more than offset by unfavorable country mix, volatile currency and significant production takeout to adjust for market demand and reduce our inventory levels. 
Today, inventories are in good shape, and we do not expect that to be a headwind going forward as long as demand remains at current levels. We also continue to execute our restructuring plan, and we expect that our actions will allow us to return to profitability in the second half. 
Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales decreased 7% during the quarter to $241 million, down from $257 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 6%. The region's operating profit of $14 million improved sequentially and was essentially flat to the prior year. 
Overall, favorable product price/mix and consumer preference for our new product launches, particularly in India, was offset by volatile currency and unfavorable material cost. In local currency, India achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter, and this confirms that our consumer-relevant innovation is winning in the marketplace. 
Turning to Slide 21. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. These products show just a glimpse of how we are advancing our global brand portfolio in more than 130 markets around the world. 
Finally, we continue to see tremendous growth potential in emerging markets, where product penetration levels remain low as you can see on Slide 22. Despite the temporary slowdown, we expect to see a return to growth in these emerging markets as more consumers are able to purchase appliances and benefit from the quality and convenience they provide. The potential in developing countries is tremendous if we consider the population and economic growth trends combined with these low penetration levels. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review."
314515,213795216,329649,"Whirlpool Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing",1154,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance. 
As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. For the first 6 months of the year, we have earned GAAP EPS of $2.60 per share, essentially the midpoint of annual guidance, and ongoing business operations EPS of just under $3 per share. 
As you know, we do not provide quarterly earnings guidance. It's important to note, however, that our first half earning results are ahead of the plan we established entering the year. These results are driven by our ongoing operating profit margin, which has essentially doubled from the second half 2011. Our run rate continues to support the full year guidance we've provided several months ago, which we are again reconfirming today. Our lower tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment, is offsetting the unfavorable currency impact on our business. Operationally, our EPS guidance for the year remains solid and unchanged. 
As you can see on Slide 25, we continue to expect 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the year, which translates into a 300-basis point improvement. With our first half results on plan and close to the low end of this range, we fully expect margins to continue improving during the second half of the year. 
Let me spend a minute on our year-over-year margin improvement. For the first half of the year, the drivers of our performance have been price/mix, which is up approximately 4 points and is currently tracking higher than original expectations. We continue to expect positive price/mix in the second half of the year. However, we will be comping against prior year price increases. 
Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which continues to remain on plan. We expect benefits to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year. 
Material cost inflation was approximately $175 million in the first half. And given industry demand levels, we did take actions during the second quarter to reduce production to ensure inventories remained at appropriate levels. The production cuts negatively impacted our conversion productivity. 
As you can see on Slide 25, our second half margins are expected to be, as Jeff said, between 6% to 7%. This sequential improvement is expected to be realized by the combination of improving productivity, given a solid midyear inventory position, higher volume in the second half of the year, productivity program ramp up and lower material headwinds, continued price/mix improvements from recent price increases. And finally second half margins will also benefit from higher restructuring benefits, as well as seasonality of our portables business. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Page 26, and consistent with our expectations, we did have a cash outflow for the first half of the year of $540 million. It's important to note that current year cash flow includes the final installment of $275 million associated with the Brazilian collection dispute. 
We also note that adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved over last year's first half. Now we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow between $100 million and $150 million for the year. With legacy legal liabilities and the majority of our restructuring cash outlays behind us after this year, we are very well positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow in the future. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on our second quarter results, which further solidified our full year guidance, as well as some general topics. But before I begin, as a general reminder, Slide 36 and 37 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2012 and '11. Included in this table are second quarter adjustments to drive our ongoing business operations and performance, removing the impact of restructuring expense, BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from benefit plan curtailment gain, the antitrust resolution, investment impairment and adjustment to normalize the second quarter tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 27. Let me make a couple of observations. While reported net sales declined 5%, it's important to note that net sales from constant currencies and excluding BEFIEX credits were up more than 3%. Our ongoing business operations operating profit improved by over 40%, driven primarily by positive price/mix and cost and capacity reduction initiatives, a very solid performance given lower industry demand, unfavorable currencies and higher material cost. 
On Slide 28, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, prior year GAAP results included the Brazilian collection dispute and antitrust settlement, benefits from energy tax credits, as well as significantly higher BEFIEX credits. These items are presented for your reference on Page 38. 
Second, regarding our 2012 tax rate, in the first quarter, we reported an effective GAAP tax rate of 27%; for the second quarter, it was 4% on a GAAP basis, which is lower than our full year expectations and driven by a timing of our tax planning. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 25%. For our ongoing business operations EPS, our second quarter tax rate is 22%. Now this reflects an adjustment to bring our first half tax rate to 25%. 
Slide 29 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program remains on track, and there are no changes from previous guidance. We are on track to deliver $200 million in benefit in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013. 
Let me turn now to the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits, where we monetized $2 million in credits compared to $79 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of June 30, $215 million credits remain. Given the most recent extension to August 31, we continue to expect to monetize $60 million to $80 million this year, unless the program will be extended for a third time. If the program would be extended to the end of 2012, we would expect to monetize $40 million to $50 million for the full year. 
One other item I'd like to note is on May 1, $350 million of 8% notes matured and were repaid. On June 1, we completed a 10-year debt offering of $300 million of 4.7% notes. 
Before I close on Slide 30, I want to review our short-term cash flow priorities, which remain unchanged funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contribution; dividends, as I previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy liabilities, which are largely behind us after this year; and debt repayment. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Let me sum up by saying that we are pleased with our execution of the strong actions to improve our operating margins for the first half of the year, and we are on track to achieve a record year of margin expansion throughout our global business. And I think it's important to point out that we're able to do this in a period where both in North America and Europe are at or near recession lows in terms of demand and Asia is showing -- showed the weakest negative demand growth we've seen in many, many years. 
But I think looking forward, more in line with our strategy, there are many positives that we're starting to feel better about. We are positive about what we're seeing in the U.S. with housing trends.  We're seeing a foundation beginning to form in that sector, which we think will benefit us over time. We do have significant future opportunities for our business in emerging economies such as China, India and the countries throughout Latin America. 
We continue to see improvements in price/mix driven by our leading global brand portfolio and best-in-class innovation in our product launches, and we do know that innovation sells in good markets and in difficult markets. We will accelerate and we are investing to accelerate our innovation in both existing core business and adjacent spaces to further accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. Our ability to expand our operating margins and the conclusion of the legal -- the legacy liability payments position us very well for generating strong free cash flow in the second half of the year and going into 2013. 
So overall, we're positive about the progress we're making to continue to build our position as a strong global brand and consumer products company.

I also want to take the opportunity to emphasize more -- yes, we're still a little bit cautious about a strong dynamic growth in the second half, but we are more confident about the underlying long-term and midterm demand trends and particularly by the housing, the housing starts, rental market activity, which is the large of consistent signs which made us increasingly optimistic.

What I want to point out on the price increase, first in the past, first of all, I do believe we had a very, very strong execution in this one because it's not just in this price increase we managed our mix very well, which is typically something difficult to maintain once you go up with price increases.

And we get -- on our innovation projects, we do get margin i.e. mix upgrades from that. So I guess the way I would put it is that if you look at demand, if you look at price/mix, if you look at restructuring, if you look at ongoing productivity, those are all the levers that we're focused on to drive and expand our operating margins both in North America and around the world.

Our inventories are in very good shape, so we'll have higher volumes in the second half of the year. From a productivity perspective on some of the programs, our cost change programs ramp up throughout the year. We've got programs going within the distribution network.

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. The year to date, we're",430,"Well, good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. 
Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. The year to date, we're delivering on our commitments to expand our operating margins and we significantly strengthened our free cash flow. 
In fact, these results marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement this year. 
Overall, our actions have more than offset higher material cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency. 
Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to deliver the expected $200 million of cost savings benefits for this year. And very importantly, we continue to see strong price and mix improvement during the quarter driven by a strong of new product introduction and our strong global consumer brand portfolio which is enabling us to mix up in most markets around the world. As a result, we're increasing our full year ongoing business operation guidance for EPS to $6.90 to $7.10 per share and our free cash flow to between $125 million and $175 million. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that overall revenues were up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX. This revenue growth was driven by our strong price and mix. 
Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 6x what they were last year to $1.80 per share compared to $0.29 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow improved significantly year-over-year from our ongoing business operations. 
Turning to Slide 7, you can see our industry demand assumptions for the year. Globally, we continue to expect second half industry demand to improve from first half levels. 
And although while industry demand remains in many markets relatively weak, we are optimistic about some growth that we're seeing in some particular markets and particularly trends that we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. Additionally, our ongoing business performance shift should continue to improve because of our strong pipeline of new product innovations coming to the market and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives that we've already announced. 
On Slide 8, you can clearly see our positive price and mix and margin expansion trends over the last several quarters. Year-to-date, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin and we fully expect to reach our full year operating profit margin guidance of between 5.5% and 6%. 
At this point in time I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations."

Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter. Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margin from the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margin exceed [ph] 9%",289,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter. 
Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margin from the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margin exceed [ph] 9% [ph] of the quarter and were driven by price and mix. 
And our continued investment in innovation, coupled with strong market execution drove significant part of the improvement. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see net sales of $2.4 billion increased slightly over 2% from last year, driven by favorable price from lower volumes. 
And as we've previously stated, our priority is margin improvement. We have gained share in the higher price segment across most products, driven by innovation as evidenced by our positive mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $227 million which more than tripled as compared to $62 million in 2011. 
This means over all ongoing business operating margin was up almost 7 points year-over-year. In addition to price and mix, the year-over-year improvement was also driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 12. You can just see just 1 example of new innovations that's driving improved price and mix. The photos use our new Ice Collection. 
Lastly, as I mentioned on our last call, shown on Slide 13. It is important to point out that there is good upside for the business as underlying industry demand improves. And as we've already stated during our last earnings call, we continue to see some early, but consistent signs of housing recovery which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

We delive",523,"Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 15. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions which more than offset the effect of unfavorable currency and the weak economic environment in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across our international business, as we continue to launch consumer relevant innovations in every product category around the world. 
If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results. Sales of $1.2 billion were flat to the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 21% on higher volumes and improved mix. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $180 [ph] million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $105 million compared to $85 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. 
We saw good market demand in Brazil and across the entire Latin America region. 
Turning to Slide 17. We gained share in our core 3 appliances with a positive price and mix, offsetting the adverse effects of higher material cost. For our Latin America business outside of Brazil, we had a record operating profit across the region and our adjusted margin increased more than 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 18. During the quarter, we faced continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone, negative conversion due to reduced production, unfavorable currency and high raw material cost. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales declined to $703 million, with unit shipments down 9% compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 10%. The region had an operating loss of $35 million, compared to the $12 million loss in the prior year period. 
Given the environment, we have taken appropriate actions to position the business for a return to profitability during the fourth quarter. As we realize benefits from our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, benefit from higher seasonal volumes during the fourth quarter, improved price and mix within key countries and across our distribution, supported by new product innovations and realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives which will ramp up in the fourth quarter. We will further accelerate these actions to ensure we move to a profitable position despite a continued negative environment. 
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 19. During the quarter, we gained market share in India and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand and unfavorable currency. 
Net sales decreased 6% during the quarter to $201 million, down from $250 [ph] million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $4 million in the prior year. 
In local currency, we are on track for a record year of performance in India despite lower industry volumes and higher material costs. 
Slide 20 shows the continued strong cadence of new international product launches and design awards during the quarter. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli."

As mentioned and as shown on Slide 22 given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends. Entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.1",690,"Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. As mentioned and as shown on Slide 22 given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends. Entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.10 per share compared to the previous range of $6.50 to $7. 
We are also increasing our free cash flow guidance to between $125 million and $175 million. 
As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to expect the 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the full year. This translate into a 300 basis point improvement. 
Our ongoing operating profit margin increased to approximately 6% during the third quarter and is expected to continue increasing in the fourth quarter, given higher seasonal volumes, benefits from our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and continued sequential productivity improvement. 
Our year-over-year margin improvement drivers for Q3 were price/mix which is up approximately 4 points, and is trending higher than original expectations. Driven by both cost-based price increases, as well as favorable mix, we continue to expect positive year-over-year price and mix for the balance of the year. 
Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, contributing over a point to our year-over-year margin improvement during the quarter. 
Material cost inflation was approximately $60 million in the third quarter. While we did benefit from sequential improvement in productivity from the second quarter, our productivity was somewhat impacted due to continued weakness in demand, primarily within Western Europe. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 24. Consistent with our expectations, we did have cash outflow through the first 9 months of the year of $435 million, significantly better than the $740 million of outflow last year. 
Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $450 [ph] million compared to this time last year. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our third quarter results and 2012 guidance. 
Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slide 33 and 34 in the appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profits and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2012 and 2011. 
Included in this table, our third quarter 2012 adjustments to drive our ongoing business operation performance, removing the impact of restructuring, tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an adjustment to normalize the third quarter tax rate to reflect the rate of 25% which is consistent with our full-year tax rate assumption. 
Turning to financial summary on Slides 25 and 26. Let me provide a couple of important observations. 
It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies and excluding BEFIEX credits were up approximately 5%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax were $13 [ph] million compared to $62 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. 
As of September 30, $202 million of credits remain. The IPI tax holiday in Brazil was recently extended to December 31. And we now expect to monetize approximately $40 million to $45 million for the full year. 
We got interest in sundry. In the third quarter, we resolved some nonrecurring legal items. The net impact of these, $22 million in expense was recorded interest in sundry for the quarter and as adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results. 
Slide 27 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program is progressing very well. We are on track to deliver $200 million of benefit in 2012, with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013. 
In closing, 2012 is shaping up to be a very solid year of margin improvement. We have a vast majority of our legacy legal liability payments behind us and our underlying operating cash flow is strong. 
During the fourth quarter, the company completes its annual planning process, including contract negotiation with piece stakeholders. Consistent with prior year's practice, we will provide guidance for 2013 during our next conference call in late January or early February. Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Again, we are delivering our margin expansion and cash flow commitments for the year. We continue to increase our gains in new product innovation in the marketplace. We are realizing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and we are beginning to see some positive growth trends, in particular recent housing trends. 
So overall, we are pleased with our progress and we expect to finish this year strong. 
Given our improving operating margins, we are upwardly revising our ongoing business operations and free cash flow guidance. And as we enter the fourth quarter, we are on track for the year to realize our full year operating margin target of 5.5% to 6%. I believe this will, we will achieve a record year of margin expansion across our overall business. And we certainly believe at this point in time we are on track towards delivering our midterm 8% operating margin target. 
As Larry mentioned, we're not giving 2013 guidance today, but we do fully expect our positive momentum to carry over into 2013 as an even greater benefit from our restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as a continued strong in new product introductions. 
Finally, in Slide 30. I'm increasingly confident in opportunities that we see to grow our business. These opportunities for us will come through our investments and consumer relevant innovations. We see appliance growth opportunities, in both developed and emerging markets. We are making good progress in expanding into higher margins, faster growing adjacent businesses and we continue to strengthen our global brand portfolio. 
We continue to make progress on our roadmap for growth. And more importantly we're performing at levels and we will continue to increase those levels to create value for our shareholders. So with that, I'm going to close on our formal remarks and open this up for questions."

First of all on market share, let me give you a broader context. I mean we've said all along, I think over the last 5 [ph] or 6 [ph] earnings calls, I mean our focus is on restoring operating margin. And there simply because it doesn't make sense to push the volume margin. I think it's more what we delivered on our promise. We outperformed our compares by a long shot in our operating margin in North America. With that in mind, our share of loss is actually very small. And I think more important, and I'm coming to you by design if you could break down the component of the share movement. We actually gained share in the hiring segment. That is evidenced by the strong exceptionally strong product mix price/mix which we. And obviously, you wouldn't get the kind of mix if you don't gain share in the higher segment. At the same time, and as by design element, we did not go up a certain unprofitable low end market share. As in I would say set by design to be stabilized by now. We don't expect forward guidance, but I would consider right now to be a stable market share and we're pretty comfortable with the levels right now. On your second part of your question, sequential pricing. Actually, as Larry indicated, the global price in Q3 was 4%, slightly above 4% year-over-year. North America was quite a bit above that, which basically also tells you sequentially we were  stable. Which I would say given that going the anniversary of the price of last year is a very strong performance. And again, as I mentioned before, is largely mix driven.

Obviously, did contract of channel is significantly lower to retail 2005 [ph] or 2006 [ph] factor of 3 [ph]. Now what has happened in the meantime is I would say significant strength in our position in that contract in the channel and in our view well positioned in the upturn in the market. Given the recent trends in the housing market, it is yet too early to see that impact now in our numbers. Yet you see an increase in the building contract channels, but it's not to a magnitude that has have significant weight in our overall business. Having said that, with ongoing good news in the housing market, I expect that positive momentum to more and more show up in our overall numbers."

Despite generally difficult economic conditions around the world, we continue to see every day the consumers pay for real innovation. And that's why our focus is and has been all through this downturn -- we never have stopped to reduce our level of investment in new product innovation or R&D. If anything, we've been increasing it of late. So you would expect the cadence of innovation from us to continue and probably at an increasing rate. Because that was strong brands is how you can sell and create value in our business, at least in our business model. But we don't take our productivity. That's why a year ago, we said we did not know when global demand levels would return or what the new norm was. And that we were going to reduce our fixed cost by $400 million to adjust to this -- today's level of demand and expand our operating margins. And we'll have that again $200 million, which is almost a full point or is a full point going into next year that we fully expect to realize. And then lastly, I had to add productivity. Again, even during this downturn, prolonged downturn and weak global GDP growth, we've had tremendous material cost inflation. There are times, like we did this year and some last year, where it is imperative that we go out with cost-based price increases as we have. In some high inflation markets of the world, we even recently announced new pricing increases. So we're willing to do that. I think going back to Marc's question, we don't see a lot of value in chasing low-end in our view profit, destroying pieces of the business when we have opportunities to invest in new product innovation that we get paid for. So we are committed. We're by no means done in our operating margin target that we laid out a couple of years ago for 2014 say plus percent operating profit. We are still committed to that. And we see ample opportunities around the world to be able to achieve that."

But it also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have lower BEFIEX credits obviously less cash and we have legal resolutions that also occurred in Q3. We'll have a little bit slightly higher working capital than we originally expected. We're taking a lot of working capital to generate cash. So net-net, operationally, the business is doing well from a cash perspective. From a pension expense perspective, again both in the U.S. and foreign, we have about $50 million of pension expense. We'll provide you with additional guidance when we talk next time regarding expense. The new legislation will increase our pension expense by about $12 million next year, but I don't expect a significant increase about that."

Our remarks today, tracked with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

Year to date, we're deli",429,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. Year to date, we're delivering on our commitments to expand our operating margins, and we've significantly strengthened our free cash flow. In fact, these results marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement this year. 
Overall, our actions have more than offset higher material cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to deliver the expected $200 million of cost savings benefits for this year. And very importantly, we continue to see strong price and mix improvement during the quarter driven by a strong cadence of new product introduction and our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up in most markets around the world. As a result, we're increasing our full year ongoing business operation guidance for EPS to $6.90 to $7.10 per share and our free cash flow to between $125 million and $175 million. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that overall revenues were up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX. This revenue growth was driven by our strong price and mix. 
Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 6x what they were last year to $1.80 per share compared to $0.29 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow improved significantly year-over-year from our ongoing business operations. 
Turning to Slide 7, you can see our industry demand assumptions for the year. Globally, we continue to expect second half industry demand to improve from first half levels. 
And although while industry demand remains in many markets relatively weak, we are optimistic about some growth that we're seeing in some particular markets, and particularly, trends that we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. Additionally, our ongoing business performance shift continue to improve because of our strong pipeline of new product innovations coming to the market and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives that we've already announced. 
On Slide 8, you can clearly see our positive price and mix and margin expansion trends over the last several quarters. Year-to-date, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin, and we fully expect to reach our full year operating profit margin guidance of between 5.5% and 6%. 
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer, for his review of our North America operations."

Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margins for the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margins exceed 9% for the quarter and were driven by price and mix. Our continuous investment in innovation, coupled with strong market execution, drove significant product improvement. 
Turning to Slide 11. You see the net sales of $2.4 billion increased slightly over 2% from last year, driven by favorable price from lower volumes. 
And as we've previously stated, our priority is margin improvement. We have gained share in the higher price segment across most products, driven by innovation, as evidenced by our positive mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $227 million, which more than tripled as compared to $62 million in 2011. This means overall ongoing business operating margin was up almost 7 points year-over-year. In addition to price and mix, the year-over-year improvement was also driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 12. You can just see just one example of a new innovation that is driving improved price and mix. The photo shows our new Whirlpool brand, White Ice Collection. 
Lastly, as I mentioned on our last call, shown on Slide 13. It is important to point out that there is good upside for the business as underlying industry demand improves. And as we've already stated during our last earnings call, we continue to see some early, but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

We deliv",519,"Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 15. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable currency and the weak economic environment in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across our international business, as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. 
If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results. Sales of $1.2 billion were flat to the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 21% on higher volumes and improved mix. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $118 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $105 million compared to $85 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. We saw good market demand in Brazil and across the entire Latin America region. 
Turning to Slide 17. We gained share in our core 3 appliances with a positive price and mix, offsetting the adverse effects of higher material cost. For our Latin America business outside of Brazil, we had a record operating profit across the region and our adjusted margin increased more than 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 18. During the quarter, we faced continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone, negative conversion due to reduced production, unfavorable currency and high raw material cost. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales declined to $703 million, with unit shipments down 9% compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 10%. The region had an operating loss of $35 million, compared to the $12 million loss in the prior year period. 
Given the environment, we have taken appropriate actions to position the business for a return to profitability during the fourth quarter as we realize benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, benefit from higher seasonal volumes during the fourth quarter, improved price and mix within key countries and across our distribution, supported by new product innovations and realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives, which will ramp up in the fourth quarter. We will further accelerate these actions to ensure we move to a profitable position despite a continued negative environment. 
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 19. During the quarter, we gained market share in India and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand and unfavorable currency. 
Net sales decreased 6% during the quarter to $201 million, down from $215 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $4 million in the prior year. 
In local currency, we are on track for a record year of performance in India despite lower industry volumes and higher material costs. 
Slide 20 shows the continued strong cadence of new international product launches and design awards during the quarter. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli."

As Jeff mentioned and as shown on Slide 22, given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends, entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90",689,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned and as shown on Slide 22, given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends, entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.10 per share compared to the previous range of $6.50 to $7. 
We're also increasing our free cash flow guidance to between $125 million and $175 million. As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to expect the 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the full year. This translates into a 300 basis point improvement. 
Our ongoing operating profit margins increased to approximately 6% during the third quarter and is expected to continue increasing in the fourth quarter, given higher seasonal volumes, benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and continued sequential productivity improvement. 
Our year-over-year margin improvement drivers for Q3 were price/mix, which was up approximately 4 points, and is trending higher than original expectations. Driven by both cost-based price increases, as well as favorable mix, we continue to expect positive year-over-year price and mix for the balance of the year. 
Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, contributing over a point to our year-over-year margin improvement during the quarter. 
Material cost inflation was approximately $60 million in the third quarter. While we did benefit from sequential improvement in productivity from the second quarter, our productivity was somewhat impacted due to continued weakness in demand, primarily within Western Europe. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 24. Consistent with our expectations, we did have cash outflow through the first 9 months of the year of $435 million, significantly better than the $740 million of outflow last year. 
Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $450 million compared to this time last year. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our third quarter results and 2012 guidance. Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slide 33 and 34 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profits and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2012 and 2011. 
Included in this table, our third quarter 2012 adjustments to drive our ongoing business operation performance, removing the impact of restructuring, tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an adjustment to normalize the third quarter tax rate to reflect the rate of 25% which is consistent with our full year tax rate assumption. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slides 25 and 26. Let me provide a couple of important observations. It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies and excluding, BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 5%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $13 million compared to $62 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of September 30, $202 million of credits remain. The IPI tax holiday in Brazil was recently extended to December 31, and we now expect to monetize approximately $40 million to $45 million for the full year. 
Regarding interest and sundry. In the third quarter, we resolved some nonrecurring legal items. The net impact of these, $22 million in expense was recorded in interest and sundry for the quarter and is adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results. 
Slide 27 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program is progressing very well. We are on track to deliver $200 million of benefit in 2012, with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013. 
In closing, 2012 is shaping up to be a very solid year of margin improvement. We have a vast majority of our legacy legal liability payments behind us, and our underlying operating cash flow is strong. 
During the fourth quarter, the company completes its annual planning process, including contract negotiation with key stakeholders. Consistent with prior year's practice, we will provide guidance for 2013 during our next conference call in late January, early February. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Again, we are delivering our margin expansion and cash flow commitments for the year. We continue to increase our cadence of new product innovation in the marketplace. We are realizing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and we're beginning to see some positive growth trends, in particular, recent U.S. housing trends. So overall, we're pleased with our progress, and we expect to finish this year strong. 
Given our improving operating margins, we're upwardly revising our ongoing business operations and free cash flow guidance. And as we enter the fourth quarter, we are on track for the year to realize our full year operating margin target of 5.5% to 6%. I believe this will, we will achieve a record year for margin expansion across our global business. And we certainly believe, at this point in time, we are on track towards delivering our midterm 8% operating margin target. 
As Larry mentioned, we're not giving 2013 guidance today, but we do fully expect our positive momentum to carry over into 2013 as we realize an even greater benefit from our restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. 
Finally, on Slide 30. I'm increasingly confident in our opportunities that we see to grow in our business. These opportunities for us will come through our investments and consumer-relevant innovations. We see appliance growth opportunities, in both developed and emerging markets. We are making good progress in expanding into higher margins, faster-growing adjacent businesses, and we continue to strengthen our global brand portfolio. 
We continue to make progress on our roadmap for growth. And more importantly, we're performing at levels, and we'll continue to increase those  levels to create value for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'm going to close in on our formal remarks and open this up for questions."

First of all, on market share, and let me give you a broader context. I mean we've said all along, I think over the last 5 or 6 earnings calls, that our focus is on restoring operating margin. And why? Very simply because it doesn't make sense to push for volume when you have sub-par margin. I think it's more than fair to say what we've delivered on that promise. We outperformed our competitors by a long shot in our operating margin in North America. With that in mind, our share loss actually is fairly small. And I think more important, and I'm coming to you coming on by line is if you break down the component of the share movement. We actually gained share in the higher end segment. That is evidenced by the strong, I mean with the exceptionally strong product mix, price/mix which we got in Q3. And obviously, you wouldn't get that kind of mix if you don't gain share in the higher end segment. At the same time, and that's by design element, we kind of -- we did not go up to a certain unprofitable low end market shares. [indiscernible] by design, and I would say that has certainly stabilized now. So I don't expect -- even as you know we don't give forward guidance, but I would consider that right now as a stable market share, and we're pretty comfortable with the levels right now. Pretty good. On your second part of your question, the sequential pricing. Actually, as Larry indicated, the global price in Q3 was 4%, slightly above 4% year-over-year. North America was quite a bit above that, which basically also tells you sequentially we were stable, which I would say given that we've kind of -- going to anniversary of the price increase of last year is a very strong performance. And again, as I mentioned before, it's largely mix driven, because obviously, the like-for-like price impact basic levels of [indiscernible] anniversary for price increases."

As a matter of fact, what we saw in September is that we started to recover share in key categories that we wanted to, and we expect that to continue as we go into the fourth quarter. In terms of your second question on sequential price/mix. For the overall international region, we were stable. And then the region to region, it was more or less stable in most of the regions, I think slightly down in Europe, but everywhere else, it was stable."

Obviously, to [indiscernible] weigh of so-called contract to build the channel is significantly lower [indiscernible]. We're talking about a factor 3. Now what has happened in the meantime is, I would say, significant strength in our position in that contract to build the channel and are therefore, in our view, very well positioned to an upturn in that market.

Despite generally difficult economic conditions around the world, we continue to see every day the consumers pay for real innovation. And that's why our focus is and has been all through this downturn -- we never have stopped to reduce our level of investment in new product innovation or R&D. If anything, we've been increasing it of late. So you would expect the cadence of innovation from us to continue and probably at an increasing rate. Because that is -- that with strong brands is how you can sell and create value in our business, at least in our business model. But we don't take our productivity. That's why a year ago, we said we did not know when global demand levels would return or what the new norm was. And that we were going to reduce our fixed cost by $400 million to adjust to this -- today's level of demand and expand our operating margins. And we'll have that again $200 million, which is almost a full point or is a full point going into next year, that we fully expect to realize. And then lastly, I'd add productivity. Again, even during this downturn, prolonged downturn and weak global GDP growth, we've had tremendous amount [ph] of  material cost inflation. There are times, like we did this year and some last year, where it is imperative that we go out with cost-based price increases as we have. In some high inflation markets of the world, we even recently announced new price increases. So we're willing to do that. I think going back to Marc's question, we don't see a lot of value in chasing low end in our view profit, destroying pieces of the business when we have opportunities to invest in new product innovation that we get paid for. So we're committed. We're by no means done in our operating margin target that we laid out a couple of years ago for 2014, say, plus percent operating profit. We're still committed to that, and we see ample opportunities around the world to be able to achieve that."

We have higher seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter and we already saw -- we were already profitable in the month of September, and we see that continuing in October. So we're pretty confident that we've -- that all of the actions that we've been taking very aggressively are really starting to work. And we're are beginning to see that turn in Europe."

When people go into stores and see our products, they see things very dramatically differently than they did 10 years earlier when they purchased whatever product we're replacing. And that value's relevant. Yes, there is a small portions of the market, who can only buy the affordable -- from a price standpoint, opening price point product, but that's very low in our market compared, certainly, to other markets around the world. And what we've seen with again, only a small, less than a half a year interruption is that when you bring value to the marketplace in the form of new product innovation, given consumers' choice, they will mix themselves up because the value they're receiving is a great value. It's a value in terms of performance of the machine, the energy efficiency, the water efficiency, the design and on and on and on. So I don't see this as a 2012 trend. I see this as a structural trend. And our view is, is to increase our cadence in new product innovation, continue to offer great values in the marketplace, supported by consumer demand and strong brand preference brands and that -- and we have a portfolio that's made to mix up."

And we have these legal resolutions that also occurred in Q3. We'll have a little bit slightly higher working capital than we originally expected. We're taking out a lot of working capital to generate cash. So net-net, operationally, the business is doing well from a cash perspective. From a pension expense perspective, again, both in the U.S. and foreign, we have about $50 million of pension expense.

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operation as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. 
Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. Year to date, we're deli",429,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. Year to date, we're delivering on our commitments to expand our operating margins, and we've significantly strengthened our free cash flow. In fact, these results marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement this year. 
Overall, our actions have more than offset higher material cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to deliver the expected $200 million of cost savings benefits for this year. And very importantly, we continue to see strong price and mix improvement during the quarter driven by a strong cadence of new product introduction and our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up in most markets around the world. As a result, we're increasing our full year ongoing business operation guidance for EPS to $6.90 to $7.10 per share and our free cash flow to between $125 million and $175 million. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that overall revenues were up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX. This revenue growth was driven by our strong price and mix. 
Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 6x what they were last year to $1.80 per share compared to $0.29 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow improved significantly year-over-year from our ongoing business operations. 
Turning to Slide 7, you can see our industry demand assumptions for the year. Globally, we continue to expect second half industry demand to improve from first half levels. 
And although while industry demand remains in many markets relatively weak, we are optimistic about some growth that we're seeing in some particular markets, and particularly trends that we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. Additionally, our ongoing business performance shift continue to improve because of our strong pipeline of new product innovations coming to the market and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives that we've already announced. 
On Slide 8, you can clearly see our positive price and mix and margin expansion trends over the last several quarters. Year-to-date, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin, and we fully expect to reach our full year operating profit margin guidance of between 5.5% and 6%. 
At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations."

Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margins for the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margins exceed 9% for the quarter and were driven by price and mix. Our continuous investment in innovation, coupled with strong market execution, drove significant product improvement. 
Turning to Slide 11. You see the net sales of $2.4 billion increased slightly over 2% from last year, driven by favorable price from lower volumes. 
And as we've previously stated, our priority is margin improvement. We have gained share in the higher price segment across most products, driven by innovation, as evidenced by our positive mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $227 million, which more than tripled as compared to $62 million in 2011. This means overall ongoing business operating margin was up almost 7 points year-over-year. In addition to price and mix, the year-over-year improvement was also driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 12. You can just see just one example of a new innovation that is driving improved price and mix. The photo shows our new Whirlpool brand, White Ice Collection. 
Lastly, as I mentioned on our last call, shown on Slide 13. It is important to point out that there is good upside for the business as underlying industry demand improves. And as we've already stated during our last earnings call, we continue to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations."

We deliv",519,"Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 15. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable currency and the weak economic environment in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across our international business, as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. 
If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results. Sales of $1.2 billion were flat to the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 21% on higher volumes and improved mix. 
Operating profit for the quarter totaled $118 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $105 million compared to $85 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. We saw good market demand in Brazil and across the entire Latin America region. 
Turning to Slide 17. We gained share in our core 3 appliances with a positive price and mix, offsetting the adverse effects of higher material cost. For our Latin America business outside of Brazil, we had a record operating profit across the region and our adjusted margin increased more than 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 18. During the quarter, we faced continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone, negative conversion due to reduced production, unfavorable currency and high raw material cost. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales declined to $703 million, with unit shipments down 9% compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 10%. The region had an operating loss of $35 million compared to the $12 million loss in the prior year period. 
Given the environment, we have taken appropriate actions to position the business for a return to profitability during the fourth quarter as we realize benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, benefit from higher seasonal volumes during the fourth quarter, improved price and mix within key countries and across our distribution, supported by new product innovations and realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives, which will ramp up in the fourth quarter. We will further accelerate these actions to ensure we move to a profitable position despite a continued negative environment. 
Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 19. During the quarter, we gained market share in India and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand and unfavorable currency. 
Net sales decreased 6% during the quarter to $201 million, down from $215 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $4 million in the prior year. 
In local currency, we are on track for a record year of performance in India despite lower industry volumes and higher material costs. 
Slide 20 shows the continued strong cadence of new international product launches and design awards during the quarter. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli."

As Jeff mentioned and as shown on Slide 22, given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends, entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.10 per share compared to the previous range of $6.50 to $7. 
We're also increasing our free cash flow guidance to between $125 million and $175 million. As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to expect the 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the full year. This translates into a 300 basis point improvement. 
Our ongoing operating profit margins increased to approximately 6% during the third quarter and is expected to continue increasing in the fourth quarter, given higher seasonal volumes, benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and continued sequential productivity improvement. 
Our year-over-year margin improvement drivers for Q3 were price/mix, which was up approximately 4 points and is trending higher than original expectations. Driven by both cost-based price increases, as well as favorable mix, we continue to expect positive year-over-year price and mix for the balance of the year. 
Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, contributing over a point to our year-over-year margin improvement during the quarter. 
Material cost inflation was approximately $60 million in the third quarter. While we did benefit from sequential improvement in productivity from the second quarter, our productivity was somewhat impacted due to continued weakness in demand, primarily within Western Europe. 
Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 24. Consistent with our expectations, we did have cash outflow through the first 9 months of the year of $435 million, significantly better than the $740 million of outflow last year. 
Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $450 million compared to this time last year. 
Let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our third quarter results and 2012 guidance. Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slide 33 and 34 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profits and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2012 and 2011. 
Included in this table, our third quarter 2012 adjustments to drive our ongoing business operation performance, removing the impact of restructuring, tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an adjustment to normalize the third quarter tax rate to reflect the rate of 25% which is consistent with our full year tax rate assumption. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slides 25 and 26, let me provide a couple of important observations. It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies and excluding, BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 5%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $13 million compared to $62 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of September 30, $202 million of credits remain. The IPI tax holiday in Brazil was recently extended to December 31, and we now expect to monetize approximately $40 million to $45 million for the full year. 
Regarding interest and sundry. In the third quarter, we resolved some nonrecurring legal items. The net impact of these, $22 million in expense was recorded in interest and sundry for the quarter and is adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results. 
Slide 27 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program is progressing very well. We are on track to deliver $200 million of benefit in 2012, with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013. 
In closing, 2012 is shaping up to be a very solid year of margin improvement. We have a vast majority of our legacy legal liability payments behind us, and our underlying operating cash flow is strong. 
During the fourth quarter, the company completes its annual planning process, including contract negotiation with key stakeholders. Consistent with prior year's practice, we will provide guidance for 2013 during our next conference call in late January, early February. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff."

Again, we are delivering our margin expansion and cash flow commitments for the year. We continue to increase our cadence of new product innovation in the marketplace. We are realizing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and we're beginning to see some positive growth trends, in particular recent U.S. housing trends. So overall, we're pleased with our progress, and we expect to finish this year strong. 
Given our improving operating margins, we're upwardly revising our ongoing business operations and free cash flow guidance. And as we enter the fourth quarter, we are on track for the year to realize our full year operating margin target of 5.5% to 6%. I believe this will, we will achieve a record year for margin expansion across our global business. And we certainly believe at this point in time we are on track towards delivering our midterm 8% operating margin target. 
As Larry mentioned, we're not giving 2013 guidance today, but we do fully expect our positive momentum to carry over into 2013 as we realize an even greater benefit from our restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. 
Finally on Slide 30. I'm increasingly confident in our opportunities that we see to grow in our business. These opportunities for us will come through our investments and consumer-relevant innovations. We see appliance growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We are making good progress in expanding into higher margins, faster-growing adjacent businesses, and we continue to strengthen our global brand portfolio. 
We continue to make progress on our roadmap for growth. And more importantly we're performing at levels, and we'll continue to increase those levels to create value for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'm going to close in on our formal remarks and open this up for questions."

First of all on market share, and let me give you a broader context. I mean we've said all along, I think over the last 5 or 6 earnings calls, that our focus is on restoring operating margin. And why? Very simply because it doesn't make sense to push for volume when you have sub-par margin. I think it's more than fair to say what we've delivered on that promise. We outperformed our competitors by a long shot in our operating margin in North America. With that in mind, our share loss actually is fairly small. And I think more important, and I'm coming to you coming on by line is if you break down the component of the share movement. We actually gained share in the higher end segment. That is evidenced by the strong, I mean with the exceptionally strong product mix, price/mix which we got in Q3. And obviously you wouldn't get that kind of mix if you don't gain share in the higher end segment. At the same time, and that's by design element, we kind of -- we did not go up to a certain unprofitable low end market shares. [indiscernible] by design, and I would say that has certainly stabilized now. So I don't expect -- even as you know we don't give forward guidance, but I would consider that right now as a stable market share, and we're pretty comfortable with the levels right now. Pretty good. On your second part of your question, the sequential pricing. Actually, as Larry indicated, the global price in Q3 was 4%, slightly above 4% year-over-year. North America was quite a bit above that, which basically also tells you sequentially we were stable, which I would say given that we've kind of -- going to anniversary of the price increase of last year is a very strong performance. And again, as I mentioned before, it's largely mix driven, because obviously the like-for-like price impact basic levels of [indiscernible] anniversary for price increases."

And that's still the plan, and we're on track to do that. Separate from that is our ongoing net cost productivity, which takes into account material inflation, et cetera, et cetera, and then the productivity actions that we take to offset that. This year we continue to have, given the GDP around the world, very high raw material cost inflation. We had very high salary and benefits and electricity and things like that around the world. We did have a good -- we are having a good year of gross productivity. But that's an area where we have not been able to fully offset that inflation in our net productivity. Going into next year, we will see when we give guidance in late January, early February. We'll give you our assumptions on that but typically, we would try to offset all of that and have positive net productivity, particularly if we had stable or modestly growing volume."

Obviously, to date the weight of so-called contract to build the channel is significantly lower [indiscernible]. We're talking about a factor of 3. Now what has happened in the meantime is, I would say, significant strength in our position in that contract to build the channel and are therefore, in our view, very well positioned to an upturn in that market. Given the recent trends in the housing market, it is yet too early to see that impact in our numbers.

Despite generally difficult economic conditions around the world, we continue to see every day the consumers pay for real innovation. And that's why our focus is and has been all through this downturn -- we never have stopped to reduce our level of investment in new product innovation or R&D. If anything, we've been increasing it of late. So you would expect the cadence of innovation from us to continue and probably at an increasing rate. Because that is -- that with strong brands is how you can sell and create value in our business, at least in our business model. But we don't take our productivity. That's why a year ago we said we did not know when global demand levels would return or what the new norm was. And that we were going to reduce our fixed costs by $400 million to adjust to this -- today's level of demand and expand our operating margins. And we'll have that again $200 million, which is almost a full point or is a full point going into next year that we fully expect to realize. And then lastly, I'd add productivity. Again, even during this downturn, prolonged downturn and weak global GDP growth, we've had tremendous amount [ph] of  material cost inflation. There are times, like we did this year and some last year, where it is imperative that we go out with cost-based price increases as we have. In some high inflation markets of the world, we even recently announced new price increases. So we're willing to do that. I think going back to Marc's question, we don't see a lot of value in chasing low end in our view profit, destroying pieces of the business when we have opportunities to invest in new product innovation that we get paid for. So we're committed. We're by no means done in our operating margin target that we laid out a couple of years ago for 2014, say, plus percent operating profit. We're still committed to that, and we see ample opportunities around the world to be able to achieve that."

Looking at the performance sequentially though, up about 180 bps, excluding the gain from 2Q on slightly lower revenue and I guess part of that as you've been talking about is mix. Is that kind of the biggest driver, in terms of the sequential improvement in margin profitability? Or are there incremental benefits coming from price, or even perhaps on a sequential basis any benefit from lower raw materials?"

One is the pricing component as such, which pretty much held as an impact. However, the composition of the pricing impact has changed. And Q2 was a little bit more like-for-like and less mix. And now, it's a whole lot more mix and less like-for-like. And that's just the nature of us going through the anniversary of price increase from last year. The second component that has changed is we see cost and restructuring benefits in Q3 to a higher or much higher extent than we saw in Q2."

And just from a seasonal perspective, you normally see kind of increases in volume quarter-over-quarter. But still, if you look at the third quarter, revenues were down about 10%. But why we're confident going forward is both on the restructuring side, in terms of the benefit as you know takes a little bit longer to ramp those up. We're going to see more of those in the fourth quarter. We see more productivity coming in the fourth quarter. We have higher seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter and we already saw -- we were already profitable in the month of September, and we see that continuing in October. So we're pretty confident that we've -- that all of the actions that we've been taking very aggressively are really starting to work. And we're beginning to see that turn in Europe."

Just trying to get a sense of, I guess particularly on the mix side, the mix benefit, has that something that's been kind of just emerging over the last couple of quarters and you'd expect that positive mix shift in North America to flow over into '13? And if there's anything additional in terms of perhaps a volume benefit relative to the market in general from product innovation. And I guess both of these comments, I'm really centering around North America here."

I would say this is a trend we've seen for the last several years really, with the exception of late 2008, early 2009. Consumers buy that. And given the average points last for 10-plus years, and that we are still clearly in a replacement market. When people go into stores and see our products, they see things very dramatically differently than they did 10 years earlier when they purchased whatever product we're replacing. And that value's relevant. Yes, there is a small portion of the market who can only buy the affordable -- from a price standpoint, opening price point product, but that's very low in our market compared, certainly, to other markets around the world. And what we've seen with again, only a small, less than a half a year interruption is that when you bring value to the marketplace in the form of new product innovation, given consumers' choice, they will mix themselves up because the value they're receiving is a great value. It's a value in terms of performance of the machine, the energy efficiency, the water efficiency, the design and on and on and on. So I don't see this as a 2012 trend. I see this as a structural trend. And our view is, is to increase our cadence in new product innovation, continue to offer great values in the marketplace, supported by consumer demand and strong brand preference brands and that -- and we have a portfolio that's made to mix up."

That's to do with the new legislation. It has no P&L impact whatsoever. The cash change that you saw, we did have the higher operating performance. You mentioned the lower pension cash, a little bit lower restructuring cash. But I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have lower BEFIEX credits. This has less cash. And we have these legal resolutions that also occurred in Q3. We'll have a little bit slightly higher working capital than we originally expected. We're taking out a lot of working capital to generate cash. So net-net, operationally the business is doing well from a cash perspective. From a pension expense perspective, again, both in the U.S. and foreign, we have about $50 million of pension expense. We'll provide you with additional guidance when we talk next time regarding expense. The new legislation will increase our pension expense by about $12 million next year, but I don't expect a significant increase above that."
