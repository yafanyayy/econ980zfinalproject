Before we get started, like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world for their passion and hard work. We delivered very strong growth this quarter. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank each and every one of them. 
Our diverse global platform had once again delivered strong results, representing a great start to 2012. Double-digit growth on our North American Asia/Pacific and Specialty businesses allowed us to deliver robust financial results despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds and certain regions, specifically Europe and Australia. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and we see opportunities for upside during the year. Further, the strength of our platform, first-in-class science and robust product portfolio give us continued confidence in our long-term growth target for 2013 and beyond. 
During the first quarter, we generated total adjusted revenues of $1.58 billion, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis as compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.52, an 18% increase over the $0.44 per share we delivered during the first quarter of '11.
In our North American generics business, third-party net revenues for the quarter were $777 million, up more than 15% from the comparable year ago period. This strong growth was driven in part by a launches as of 11 products and the U.S., including ibandronate and escitalopram, a first equivalent product which generate the highest and fastest conversion rate in any generic launch we seen in history. We also enjoyed strong sales in the U.S. in many of our existing products. 
Further, consistent with the strength of our R&D capability to of the 8 first quarter products submissions we made in the U.S. or first-to-file opportunities, currently we have 171 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 40 of which are potential first to file. With regard to our neurology franchise which is our strategic growth drivers we're awaiting or 2 and the impact infringement case to trial concluded in September of '11. We remain convinced that we have an AB-rated product and look forward to is secure approval in the second half of this year. While we eagerly anticipate the court's ruling in regulatory approval, I'd like to remind them everybody that we are not relying on this product to achieve our 2013 target of $275 million. We also are pleased with our performance in Canada, and it's another example of the robust of our global pipeline. 
In Canada, we launched 9 products during the quarter, which is more than we launched during all of 2011. Our expanded portfolio is feeling sales and growth in our customer base, along with a cost of goods efficiency. At it will help us weather price cuts and remain competitive and ensure consistent supply in every product. 
In EMEA, as anticipated, we delivered third-party net revenues of $336 million during the quarter, a decline of approximately 14% compared to last year's first quarter results. On a constant currency basis, revenues saw 10%. New products launched throughout the region served to offset volume pressure on sales of existing products and mitigate some of the effects of unfavorable pricing. 
During the quarter, we also enjoyed constant currency revenue growth of 8% in Italy, one of Europe's fastest growing market, and in Spain, our sales volume grew along with this rapidly expanding market. Results in both cases were driven by increased generic utilization. Moreover, we remain on track to launch nearly 300 new products in Europe this year. By now, it should be very evident that our powerful global platform has and will continue to demonstrate its ability to absorb headwinds such as those occurring in Europe. Despite such headwinds, we have maintained our leadership position in several markets such as France, Italy, Spain, U.K., Belgium and Portugal. 
Moving now to our Asia-Pacific region. We generated third-party net-net revenues of nearly $299 million during the first quarter, an increase of more than 8% over last year's results and 12% higher on a constant currency basis. Our double-digit growth was driven largely by the strong performance of our business in India. We continue to see growth in our third-party business and accelerated growth in our ARV franchise, both in finished dosage form and API. We currently supply to more than 90 countries. We keep expanding our ARV business by adding products and geographies in expanding market access. Further, we remain on track to launch our commercial business in India later this year. 
Finally, our Mylan Specialty business reported a 67% year-over-year increase in third-party net revenues, which totaled more than $162 million during the first quarter. This exceptional performance resulted from higher sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, another strategic growth driver. Increased volumes and favorable pricing drove the growth in sales, and we continue to see double-digit accelerated quarter-over-quarter sales growth. The settlement announced this morning with Teva only further enhances our confidence in the anticipated continued strong performance of this product and our entire Specialty franchise. 
As we've stated before, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for EpiPen as only 7% or 2 million of the 28 million people estimated to be at risk for anaphylaxis actually carries one. Continually increasing public awareness is essential to ensuring access to this product for people who need it, and generating sustained market expansion. Now let me turn to some of our other important strategic growth drivers.
Our global Institutional business continues to deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate that this business can become a $1 billion franchise by 2016. We remain focused on supply chain integrity and optimization of our cost of goods, we benefited and we will continue to benefit from being vertically integrated and we now have successfully internalize the manufacture of 80% of our products globally, giving us even greater control of our cost and quality at each point in the supply chain. We also expect significant growth in our product portfolio and are on track to launch approximately 650 products and file more than 750 regulatory submissions globally this year. We also are pursuing external opportunities to expand our portfolio such as our acquisition of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant earlier this year. 
Looking at our respiratory platform, we have made good progress on the integration of the Pfizer business we acquired in November of 2011, and we believe we are on track to launch the first AV-rated generic version of 
Finally, with respect to buy generics, we have had productive discussions with the FDA regarding our portfolio and remain confident that we will be in the U.S. market starting in 2016. With that, I look forward to responding to your questions and will now turn the call over to John."

This morning, I'm going to bring referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I remind you of Kris's comments at the beginning of the call today regarding our use of adjusted measure. 
I am extremely pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, a great start to what we firmly believe will be the most successful year in our company's history. Our Q1 results were achieved and our full year results will be achieved amid the macroeconomic headwinds that continue to plague Europe and in the wake of a 10% price cut in Japan and the most significant price cuts in Australian industry, both of which occurred this quarter. This is a testament to the strength of our diverse global business, our first-in-class science, and our robust product portfolio. 
The difficult pricing environment in several of our locations was certainly not expected -- unexpected, nor were the positive development which served to offset, and in some cases, fully mitigate the unfavorable impact. In fact, our first quarter results came in line with what we -- with that which we have forecasted in our Investor Day on February 21. Also, our current quarter results were in line with those of the fourth quarter -- of 2011 on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax income in the current quarter was $304 million compared to $294 million sequentially. Getting in the details, let me walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.59 billion, an increase of 10% over last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 11%. The relatively small unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar comparison to certain other function currencies of our major operations, mainly in Europe and in India. 
Included in total revenues for the current quarter is approximately $9 million of other revenue related to a clean energy investment subsidiary, which we invested in near the end of 2011 and whose activities qualify for tax credit under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Our adjusted metrics, which I'll discuss momentarily, exclude all activity related to this investment with the exception of the net tax effect related to its operation, which is included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenue for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 first quarter was a very strong 48%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior year period. Our strong current quarter margin are primarily the result of favorable pricing on EpiPen in our Specialty segment. Within generics, gross margins remain stable as new product launches in North America served to offset the normal pricing trend in the generic pharmaceutical industry. 
Our operations, particularly in Europe, continue to employ cost-saving initiatives, especially from the perspective of cost of goods sold. These efforts have proven successful, and adjusted gross margins in Europe, on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis and excluding the effect of foreign exchange, and as we anticipated, increased nearly 300 basis points despite lower sales. And while I'm certainly not going to predict when the economic situation in Europe will improve, these initiatives are expected to continue to have an incremental positive impact on our adjusted gross margin throughout 2012. 
Adjusted operating income was $368 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 8% increase from Q1 2011. This is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I previously discussed, partially offset by increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $80 million, or approximately 5% of total revenues and up approximately 7% from the prior year. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending amounts related to our biologic and respiratory platforms has shifted into later periods of the current year with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves, and we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range. 
At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $312 million or approximately 19.7% of total revenues, closer to the high end of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to our investment in our Specialty franchise, which has resulted in higher volumes and increased market share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $411 million and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year. 
Moving onto our consolidated nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low, short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70 / 30, fixed to floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
As I mentioned before, our adjusted pre-tax earnings in the current quarter was slightly favorable as compared to that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. However, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% as compared to 23% in the sequential quarter. The net result was adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter in line with that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is unchanged at 26% to 27%, and we continue believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
First quarter adjusted net income was $224 million, or $0.52 per share, an 18% increase from our Q1 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 per share and in line with that of the fourth quarter 2011 after their adjusting for and fully consistent with, our expectations for from our -- and adjusting for the higher tax rate in Q1 2012.
Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 remains at $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And as I previously mentioned, and fully consistent with our expectations from our Investor Day, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the first before accelerating into the third quarter, which will be by far our strongest of the year and finishing with the fourth quarter that will propel us to our midpoint of $2.40 per share.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $67 million. This takes into account certain  account -- certain special area items principally the exclusion of payments of approximately $90 million related to previously settled and accrued litigation primarily related to AWP and the inclusion of approximately $62 million related to amounts due in 2012, which were received in late summer 2011 but excluded for adjusted cash flow purposes from that quarter.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was a cash outflow of $109 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $267 million. The first quarter is historically the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash and as a result of the timing of certain payments including taxes, interest and incentive optimization. But we are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion. 
First quarter capital spending was $36 million and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the quarter to acquire product rights and licenses, the majority of which relates to the purchase of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant Pharmaceuticals. 
During the current quarter, we repaid us $600 million due under our convertible notes and made a scheduled payment on our term loans. Both of these payments were made during a combination of cash on hand, borrowings our under our revolver and the cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, which we established in February. During the first quarter, we borrowed $285 million under this facility.
At the end of the quarter, following the debt repayment and additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, our leverage ratio remains at 2.9x and we continue to have more than ample borrowing capacity.
To summarize, our first quarter was strong and was in line with what we had anticipated. This is an indication of things to come throughout what we believe will be our strongest year yet and another chapter in the exciting story that is Mylan.
That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

I think with that being said, we do see increased generic utilization beginning to increase, especially in the southern European market. We saw growth and maintain leadership position obviously in Italy. We see this same with Spain. We see that volume through increased utilization offsetting some of the price cuts. So I definitely would say that governments are beginning to realize that for sustainable cost-containment, utilization increase is a more proven and has a better track record than just got a cost. So I would say there are some optimism that, that trend certainly will continue but again, we certainly didn't predict growth this year."

We do absolutely see the beginnings of this push for increased generic utilization as I said throughout Southern Europe. Italy is certainly the lead of that pack, but we do -- are very encouraged by the recent new regulation statute to try to incentivize on several fronts that increase of utilization. And like I said, I do think our efforts are paying off as we have been continuing to educate regulators and officials that utilization as much more sustainable to cost containment healthcare and the price cuts. So I think that those numbers are -- they're starting to see that obviously from other countries. And so I'm very encouraged. And in the meantime, we've maintained our leadership position, 30% of the market share. As John said, we're very focused on that operable growth and believe that, obviously, when Europe does come out of the this -- comes out of the storm they're in right now, that we're going to need the stronger than ever and certainly benefit disproportionately from now the increase in utilization. And as far as Japan goes, yes, as I said, we did see strong results. I would say that for the year, we certainly anticipate low double-digit growth in that country. And I think that it comes from a couple of places. One, as I said, we continue to enhance and are reaping the benefits of the pipeline that we started to build after our acquisition. And we see those coming to fruition and Mylan launching more products, we are launching more internally manufactured products. So the profitability of that, the country continues to increase. And again, utilization, we continue to see it creeping up close to the mid 20s. So all in all, Japan is steadily just increasing and we're very happy with our performance there."

Our ability to have the dollars in and invest the dollars we believe is another barrier to entry because we're using large dollar investments, whether it's respiratory, whether it's bio generics, doubling our size. So we believe, as I said earlier, is not necessarily just quantity, we believe not only are we investing in the right things, but certainly in a very quality way."

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world for their passion and hard work. We delivered very strong results this quarter. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank each and every one of them.
Our diverse global platform has once again delivered strong results, representing a great start to 2012. Double-digit growth on our North American Asia/Pacific and Specialty businesses allowed us to deliver robust financial results despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds in certain regions, specifically Europe and Australia. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and we see opportunities for upside during the year. Further, the strength of our platforms, first-in-class science and robust product portfolio give us continued confidence in our long-term growth target for 2013 and beyond.
During the first quarter, we generated total adjusted revenues of $1.58 billion, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis as compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.52, an 18% increase over the $0.44 per share we delivered during the first quarter of '11.
In our North American Generics business, third-party net revenues for the quarter were $777 million, up more than 15% from the comparable year-ago period. This strong result was driven in part by launches of 11 new products in the U.S., including Ibandronate and Escitalopram, our first equivalent product that generated the highest and fastest conversion rate in versus generic launch we've seen in recent history. We also enjoyed strong sales in the U.S. on many of our existing products.
Further, consistent with the strength of our R&D capabilities 2 of the 8 first quarter products submissions we made in the U.S. are first-to-file opportunities. Currently we have 171 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 40 of which are potential first to file. Regarding our neurology franchise which is our strategic growth drivers, we're awaiting the court's ruling in the Copaxone patent infringement case whose trial concluded in September of 2011. We remain convinced that we have an AB-rated product and look forward to securing approval in the second half of this year. While we eagerly anticipate the court's ruling and regulatory approval, I'd like to remind everybody that we are not relying on this product to achieve our 2013 target of $275 million. We also are pleased with our performance in Canada, and it's another example of the robustness of our global pipeline.
In Canada, we launched 9 products during the quarter, which is more than we launched during all of 2011. Our expanded portfolio is fueling sales and growth in our customer base, along with cost of goods efficiency that will help us weather price cuts and remain competitive and ensure consistent supply in every province.
In EMEA, as anticipated, we delivered third-party net revenues of $336 million during the quarter, a decline of approximately 14% compared to last year's first quarter results. On a constant currency basis, revenues fell 10%. New products launched throughout the region served to offset volume pressure on sales of existing products and mitigate some of the effects of unfavorable pricing.
During the quarter, we also enjoyed constant currency revenue growth of 8% in Italy, one of Europe's fastest growing markets. And in Spain, our sales volume grew along with this rapidly expanding market. Results in both cases were driven by increased generic utilization. Moreover, we remain on track to launch nearly 300 new products in Europe this year. By now, it should be very evident that our powerful global platform has and will continue to demonstrate its ability to absorb headwinds such as those occurring in Europe. Despite such headwinds, we have maintained our leadership positions in several markets such as France, Italy, Spain, U.K., Belgium and Portugal.
Moving now to our Asia-Pacific regions. We generated third-party net revenues of nearly $299 million during the first quarter, an increase of more than 8% over last year's results and 12% higher on a constant currency basis. Our double-digit growth was driven largely by the strong performance of our business in India. We continue to see growth in our third-party business and accelerated growth in our ARV franchise, both in finished dosage form and API. We currently supply to more than 90 countries. We keep expanding our ARV business by adding products and geographies and expanding market access. Further, we remain on track to launch our Commercial business in India later this year.
Finally, our Mylan Specialty business reported a 67% year-over-year increase in third-party net revenues, which totaled more than $162 million during the first quarter. This exceptional performance resulted from higher sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, another strategic growth driver. Increased volumes and favorable pricing drove the growth in sales, and we continue to see double-digit accelerated quarter-over-quarter sales growth. The settlement announced this morning with Teva only further enhances our confidence in the anticipated continued strong performance of this product and our entire Specialty franchise.
As we've stated before, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for EpiPen as only 7% or 2 million of the 28 million people estimated to be at risk for anaphylaxis actually carries one. Continually increasing public awareness is essential to ensuring access to this product for people who need it, and generating sustained market expansion. Now let me turn to some of our other important strategic growth drivers.
Our global Institutional business continues to deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate that this business can become a billion dollar franchise by 2016. We remain focused on supply chain integrity and optimization of our cost of goods, we benefited and we will continue to benefit from being vertically integrated and we now have successfully internalized the manufacture of 80% of our products globally, giving us even greater control of over our cost and quality at each point in the supply chain. We also expect significant growth in our product portfolio and are on track to launch approximately 650 products and file more than 750 regulatory submissions globally this year. We also are pursuing external opportunities to expand our portfolio such as our acquisition of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant earlier this year.
Looking at our respiratory platform, we have made good progress on the integration of the Pfizer business we acquired in November of 2011, and we believe we are on track to launch the first AB-rated generic version of Advair.
Finally, with respect to biogenerics, we have had productive discussions with the FDA regarding our portfolio and remain confident that we will be in the U.S. market starting in 2016. With that, I look forward to responding to your questions and will now turn the call over to John."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I remind you of Kris' comments at the beginning of the call today regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am extremely pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, a great start to what we firmly believe will be the most successful year in our company's history. Our Q1 results were achieved and our full year results will be achieved amid the macroeconomic headwinds that continue to plague Europe and in the wake of a 10% price cut in Japan and the most significant price cuts in Australian history, both of which occurred this quarter. This is a testament to the strength of our diverse global business, our first-in-class science, and our robust product portfolio.
The difficult pricing environment in several of our locations were certainly not expected -- unexpected, nor were the positive development which served to offset, and in some cases, fully mitigate the unfavorable impact. In fact, our first quarter results came in line with what we -- with that which we have forecasted in our Investor Day on February 21. Also, our current quarter results were in line with those of the fourth quarter of 2011 on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax income in the current quarter was $304 million compared to $294 million sequentially. Getting in the details, let me walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.59 billion, an increase of 10% over last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 11%. The relatively small unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to certain other functional currencies of our major operations, mainly in Europe and in India.
Included in total revenues for the current quarter is approximately $9 million of other revenue related to a clean energy investment subsidiary, which we invested in near the end of 2011 and whose activities qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Our adjusted metrics, which I'll discuss momentarily, exclude all activity related to this investment with the exception of the net tax effect related to its operation, which is included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenue for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 first quarter was a very strong 48%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior-year period. Our strong current quarter margins are primarily the result of favorable pricing on EpiPen in our Specialty segment. Within generics, gross margins remained stable as new product launches in North America served to offset the normal pricing trend in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
Our operations, particularly in Europe, continue to employ cost-savings initiatives, especially from the perspective of cost of goods sold. These efforts have proven successful, and adjusted gross margins in Europe, on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis and excluding the effect of foreign exchange, and as we anticipated, increased nearly 300 basis points despite lower sales. And while I'm certainly not going to predict when the economic situation in Europe will improve, these initiatives are expected to continue to have an incremental positive impact on our adjusted gross margin throughout 2012.
Adjusted operating income was $368 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 8% increase from Q1 2011. This is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I previously discussed, partially offset by increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $80 million, or approximately 5% of total revenues and up approximately 7% from the prior year. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending principally amounts related to our biologics and respiratory platforms has shifted into later periods of the current year with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves, and we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $312 million or approximately 19.7% of total revenues, closer to the high end of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to our investment in our Specialty franchise, which has resulted in higher volumes and increased market share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $411 million and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year. 
Moving onto our consolidated non-operating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low, short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70 / 30, fixed to floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
As I mentioned before, our adjusted pre-tax earnings in the current quarter was slightly favorable as compared to that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. However, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% as compared to 23% in the sequential quarter. The net result was adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter in line with that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is unchanged at 26% to 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
First quarter adjusted net income was $224 million, or $0.52 per share, an 18% increase from our Q1 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 per share and in line with that of the fourth quarter of 2011 after their adjusting for and fully consistent with, our expectations from our -- and adjusting for the higher tax rate in Q1 2012.
Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 remains at $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And as I previously mentioned, and fully consistent with our expectations from our Investor Day, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the first before accelerating into the third quarter, which will be by far our strongest of the year and finishing with a fourth quarter that will propel us to our midpoint of $2.40 per share.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $67 million. This takes into account certain  account -- certain special items principally the exclusion of payments of approximately $90 million related to previously settled and accrued litigation primarily related to AWP and the inclusion of approximately $62 million related to amounts due in 2012, which were received in late summer 2011 but excluded for adjusted cash flow purposes from that quarter.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was a cash outflow of $109 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $267 million. The first quarter is, historically, the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash and as a result of the timing of certain payments including taxes, interest and incentive optimization. But we are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion.
First quarter capital spending was $36 million and we expect full-year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the quarter to acquire product rights and licenses, the majority of which relates to the purchase of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant Pharmaceuticals.
During the current quarter, we repaid the $600 million due under our convertible notes and made a scheduled payment on our term loans. Both of these payments were made using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings our under our revolver and through cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, which we established in February. During the first quarter, we borrowed $285 million under this facility.
At the end of the quarter, following the debt repayment and additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, our leverage ratio remains at 2.9x and we continue to have more than ample borrowing capacity.
To summarize, our first quarter was strong and was in line with what we had anticipated. This is an indication of things to come throughout what we believe will be our strongest year yet and another chapter in the exciting story that is Mylan.
That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

And obviously, why we continue to say we did not predict or forecast growth for our European region. I think with that being said, we do see increased generic utilization beginning to increase, especially in the southern European markets. We saw growth and maintain leadership position, obviously, in Italy. And we see the same with Spain. We see that volume through increased utilization offsetting some of the price cuts. So I definitely would say that governments are beginning to realize that for sustainable cost-containment, utilization increase is a more proven, it has a better track record than just got a cost. So I would say there are some optimism that, that trend certainly will continue but again, we certainly didn't predict growth this year."

Then follow-up question for John, just looking at the company's capital structure as it currently exist. Some of the out-year debt senior notes, around, I think you're around $2.3 billion, is still sitting on the balance sheet at interest rates north of 7 1/2% and I guess given some of the recent transactions in the space and the current 0 interest rate regime across the world, I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity to refi that at more favorable rates given the company's enhanced cash flows and just stronger balance sheet position overall?"

So I think that those numbers are -- they're starting to see that, obviously, from other countries. And so I'm very encouraged. And in the meantime, we've maintained our leadership position, 30% of the market share. As John said, we're very focused on that profitable growth and believe that, obviously, when Europe does come out of this -- comes out of the storm they're in right now, that we're going to need stronger than ever and certainly benefit just [ph] proportionately [ph] from now the increase in utilization. And as far as Japan goes, yes, as I said, we did see strong results. I would say that for the year, we certainly anticipate low double-digit growth in that country. And I think that it comes from a couple of places. One, as I've said, we've continue to enhance and now reaping the benefits of the pipeline that we've started to build after our acquisition. And we see those coming to fruition so we're launching more products, we're launching more internally manufactured products. So the profitability of that, the country continues to increase.

And I guess all I'd say about commenting on #3, #4, #1, #2, we've said it's really not about the number, I think it's the quality of the assets and it's how we're building Mylan. And I think we put together a great global platform, as Robert has said, we don't need another transformational deal. But what we are very interested in is high-quality assets that we can continue to add and maximize and leverage this platform that we've brought together. And I think between our vertical integration, which is exceeding all of our wildest imaginations and the benefits we're reaping from that, just continues to boost our ability to compete in every market around the world with the highest quality products. So we've not lost our sight on our mission to reach 7 billion people and believe that we've got a lot of opportunity to get there whatever number that puts us as a global player in this marketplace."

I think you're electing to make 2 investments this year, 6 months of direct-to-consumer advertising and you've invested in a 100-person sales force. How do you measure those investments going forward? And what are the implications for at least the volume growth on EpiPen going forward? And then just for Heather, can you just maybe talk about the Teva device and is it the device that would prevent it from being therapeutically substituted for AB-rated if and when they ever get approved?"

So as I've talked about for a long time, that those regulations, and FDA clarified their position and the answer to the citizen petition a couple of years ago, that it's not that's same. Then it can't be rated substitutable and especially in a life -- on an emergency situation. So my comments have always been around our confidence and our intellectual property around our Dragon device, the regulations at FDA and the ability to have to be the same. So if you have to retrain, it's not the same. And for obviously EpiPen and anaphylaxis, obviously reaches that hurdle of being life saving on an emergency situation. So that again is why I underscore my confidence in the franchise and the hurdles for getting an AB-rated. I'll let John speak to ROI but what I will say is, we were -- after we saw the results from last year's DTC as well as other initiatives. Because while direct-to-consumer is certainly a large aspect, we're doing on many fronts, around this education. And obviously, if you look since Q3 of last year, you see just beyond accelerated double-digit growth year-over-year for each quarter. And obviously, this now being a record Quarter 1 for EpiPen and we see that continuing to grow. So it is absolutely, the results, I think, speak to the pay off here. And we just see that doing nothing but continuing to grow at an accelerated rate."

And therefore, the programs that we're running are both focused on building the awareness regarding anaphylactic shock and the value of the EpiPen for dealing with those types of life-threatening situations. And the way we measure the success of the programs, whether it be the direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns or the expansion in our field force, is by looking at the expansion of the market that's taking place. And that expansion of the market, we showed that on Investor Day, has been significant. We're off to a great start for 2012. We talked on Investor Day of the Specialty business growing 30% year-over-year for 2012. And at this point, one quarter into it, I think it's at least that."

So we believe that there is absolutely opportunity to continue to work with states because as you might imagine, there is -- all the states differ with pharmacy laws and regulations. But we are actively pursuing and looking at doing just that, working with the states, working with the FDA, to hopefully get to a place where there would be both prescription EpiPen as well as behind-the-counter EpiPen that would provide the maximum access to everybody who wanted or needed to carry an EpiPen to be able to have as many as they want and also be able to make sure, from a collaborative perspective that whether it's schools being covered, soccer fields, football as you might imagine, that not only is important to have the schools equipped, which we're launching a huge program here in the next couple of months with schools, but also everything in the community related to that.

That, that ability to not only invest from an R&D perspective and we talked a lot about our product portfolio doubling. And when you think about not only doubling, it's the quality of what we're doubling and the kind of products, again, our respiratory announcement. Our ability to have the dollars and invest the dollars we believe is another barrier to entry because we're using large dollar investments, whether it's respiratory, whether it's biogenerics, doubling our size.

Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website, as it contains detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of our actual first quarter results.
Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the materials in this call, with the exception of a participant question, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather."

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world. Through their passion and hard work, we delivered very strong results this quarter. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank each and every one of them.
Our diverse global platform has once again delivered strong results, representing a great start to 2012. Double-digit growth on our North American, Asia-Pacific and Specialty businesses allowed us to deliver robust financial results despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds in certain regions, specifically Europe and Australia. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and we see opportunities for upside during the year. Further, the strength of our platforms, first-in-class science and robust product portfolio give us continued confidence in our long-term growth target for 2013 and beyond.
During the first quarter, we generated total adjusted revenues of $1.58 billion, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis as compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.52, an 18% increase over the $0.44 per share we delivered during the first quarter of '11.
In our North American Generics business, third-party net revenues for the quarter were $777 million, up more than 15% from the comparable year-ago period. This strong result was driven in part by launches of 11 new products in the U.S., including Ibandronate and Escitalopram, a first equivalent product that generated the highest and fastest conversion rate in versus generic launch we've seen in recent history. We also enjoyed strong sales in the U.S. on many of our existing products.
Further, consistent with the strength of our R&D capabilities, 2 of the 8 first quarter products submissions we made in the U.S. are first-to-file opportunities. Currently we have 171 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 40 of which are potential first to file. Regarding our neurology franchise which is one of our strategic growth drivers, we're awaiting the court's ruling in the Copaxone patent infringement case whose trial concluded in September of 2011. We remain convinced that we have an AB-rated product and look forward to securing approval in the second half of this year. While we eagerly anticipate the court's ruling and regulatory approval, I'd like to remind everybody that we are not relying on this product to achieve our 2013 target of $275 million. We also are pleased with our performance in Canada, and it's another example of the robustness of our global pipeline.
In Canada, we launched 9 products during the quarter, which is more than we launched during all of 2011. Our expanded portfolio is fueling sales and growth in our customer base, along with cost of goods efficiency that will help us weather price cuts and remain competitive and ensure consistent supply in every province.
In EMEA, as anticipated, we delivered third-party net revenues of $336 million during the quarter, a decline of approximately 14% compared to last year's first quarter results. On a constant currency basis, revenues fell 10%. New products launched throughout the region served to offset volume pressure on sales of existing products and mitigate some of the effects of unfavorable pricing.
During the quarter, we also enjoyed constant currency revenue growth of 8% in Italy, one of Europe's fastest growing markets. And in Spain, our sales volume grew along with this rapidly expanding market. Results in both cases were driven by increased generic utilization. Moreover, we remain on track to launch nearly 300 new products in Europe this year. By now, it should be very evident that our powerful global platform has and will continue to demonstrate its ability to absorb headwinds such as those occurring in Europe. Despite such headwinds, we have maintained our leadership positions in several markets such as France, Italy, Spain, U.K., Belgium and Portugal.
Moving now to our Asia-Pacific regions. We generated third-party net revenues of nearly $299 million during the first quarter, an increase of more than 8% over last year's results and 12% higher on a constant currency basis. Our double-digit growth was driven largely by the strong performance of our business in India. We continue to see growth in our third-party business and accelerated growth in our ARV franchise, both in finished dosage form and API. We currently supply to more than 90 countries. We keep expanding our ARV business by adding products and geographies and expanding market access. Further, we remain on track to launch our Commercial business in India later this year.
Finally, our Mylan Specialty business reported a 67% year-over-year increase in third-party net revenues, which totaled more than $162 million during the first quarter. This exceptional performance resulted from higher sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, another strategic growth driver. Increased volumes and favorable pricing drove the growth in sales, and we continue to see double-digit accelerated quarter-over-quarter sales growth. The settlement announced this morning with Teva only further enhances our confidence in the anticipated continued strong performance of this product and our entire Specialty franchise.
As we've stated before, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for EpiPen as only 7% or 2 million of the 28 million people estimated to be at risk for anaphylaxis actually carries one. Continually increasing public awareness is essential to ensuring access to this product for people who need it, and generating sustained market expansion. Now let me turn to some of our other important strategic growth drivers.
Our global Institutional business continues to deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate that this business can become a billion dollar franchise by 2016. We remain focused on supply chain integrity and optimization of our cost of goods; we’ve benefited and we will continue to benefit from being vertically integrated; and we now have successfully internalized the manufacture of 80% of our products globally, giving us even greater control of over our cost and quality at each point in the supply chain. We also expect significant growth in our product portfolio and are on track to launch approximately 650 products and file more than the 750 regulatory submissions globally this year. We also are pursuing external opportunities to expand our portfolio, such as our acquisition of 2 limited-competition dermatological products from Valeant earlier this year.
Looking at our respiratory platform, we have made good progress on the integration of the Pfizer business we acquired in November of 2011, and we believe we are on track to launch the first AB-rated generic version of Advair.
Finally, with respect to biogenerics, we have had productive discussions with the FDA regarding our portfolio and remain confident that we will be in the U.S. market starting in 2016. With that, I look forward to responding to your questions and will now turn the call over to John."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I remind you of Kris' comments at the beginning of the call today regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am extremely pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, a great start to what we firmly believe will be the most successful year in our company's history. Our Q1 results were achieved and our full year results will be achieved amid the macroeconomic headwinds that continue to plague Europe and in the wake of a 10% price cut in Japan and the most significant price cuts in Australian history, both of which occurred this quarter. This is a testament to the strength of our diverse global business, our first-in-class science, and our robust product portfolio.
The difficult pricing environment in several of our locations was certainly not expected -- unexpected, nor were the positive development which served to offset, and in some cases, fully mitigate the unfavorable impact. In fact, our first quarter results came in line with what we -- with that which we have forecasted in our Investor Day on February 21. Also, our current quarter results were in line with those of the fourth quarter of 2011 on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax income in the current quarter was $304 million compared to $294 million sequentially. Getting in the details, let me walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.59 billion, an increase of 10% over last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 11%. The relatively small unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to certain other functional currencies of our major operations, mainly in Europe and in India.
Included in total revenues for the current quarter is approximately $9 million of other revenue related to a clean energy investment subsidiary, which we invested in near the end of 2011 and whose activities qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Our adjusted metrics, which I'll discuss momentarily, exclude all activity related to this investment with the exception of the net tax effect related to its operation, which is included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenue for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 first quarter was a very strong 48%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior-year period. Our strong current quarter margins are primarily the result of favorable pricing on EpiPen in our Specialty segment. Within generics, gross margins remained stable as new product launches in North America served to offset the normal pricing trend in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
Our operations, particularly in Europe, continue to employ cost-savings initiatives, especially from the perspective of cost of goods sold. These efforts have proven successful, and adjusted gross margins in Europe, on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis and excluding the effect of foreign exchange, and as we anticipated, increased nearly 300 basis points despite lower sales. And while I'm certainly not going to predict when the economic situation in Europe will improve, these initiatives are expected to continue to have an incremental positive impact on our adjusted gross margin throughout 2012.
Adjusted operating income was $368 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 8% increase from Q1 2011. This is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I previously discussed, partially offset by increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $80 million, or approximately 5% of total revenues and up approximately 7% from the prior year. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending, principally amounts related to our biologics and respiratory platform, has shifted into later periods of the current year with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves, and we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $312 million or approximately 19.7% of total revenues, closer to the high end of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to our investment in our Specialty franchise, which has resulted in higher volume and increased market share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $411 million and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year. 
Moving onto our consolidated non-operating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70:30 fixed to floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
As I mentioned before, our adjusted pre-tax earnings in the current quarter was slightly favorable as compared to that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. However, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% as compared to 23% in the sequential quarter. The net result was adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter in line with that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is unchanged at 26% to 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
First quarter adjusted net income was $224 million, or $0.52 per share, an 18% increase from our Q1 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 per share and in line with that of the fourth quarter 2011 after their adjusting for and fully consistent with, our expectations from our -- and adjusting for the higher tax rate in Q1 2012.
Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 remains at $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And as I previously mentioned, and fully consistent with our expectations from our Investor Day, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the first before accelerating into the third quarter, which will be by far our strongest of the year and finishing with a fourth quarter that will propel us to our midpoint of $2.40 per share.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $67 million. This takes into account certain – account certain special items principally the exclusion of payments of approximately $90 million related to previously settled and accrued litigation primarily related to AWP and the inclusion of approximately $62 million related to amounts due in 2012, which were received in late December 2011 but excluded for adjusted cash flow purposes from that quarter.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was a cash outflow of $109 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $267 million. The first quarter is, historically, the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash and as a result of the timing of certain payments including taxes, interest and incentive optimization. But we are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion.
First quarter capital spending was $36 million and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the quarter to acquire product rights and licenses, the majority of which relates to the purchase of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant Pharmaceuticals.
During the current quarter, we repaid the $600 million due under our convertible notes and made a scheduled payment under our term loan. Both of these payments were made using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolver and through cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, which we established in February. During the first quarter, we borrowed $285 million under this facility.
At the end of the quarter, following the debt repayment and additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, our leverage ratio remains at 2.9x and we continue to have more than ample borrowing capacity.
To summarize, our first quarter was strong and was in line with what we had anticipated. This is an indication of things to come throughout what we believe will be our strongest year yet and another chapter in the exciting story that is Mylan.
That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

I think with that being said, we do see increased generic utilization beginning to increase, especially in the southern European markets. We saw growth and maintain leadership position, obviously, in Italy. And we see the same with Spain. We see that volume through increased utilization offsetting some of the price cuts. So I definitely would say that governments are beginning to realize that for sustainable cost-containment, utilization increase is a more proven, has a better track record than just cutting cost. So I would say there is some optimism that, that trend certainly will continue but again, we certainly didn't predict growth this year."

We do absolutely see the beginnings of this push for increased generic utilization as I said, kind of, throughout Southern Europe. Italy is certainly the lead of that pack, but we do -- are very encouraged by the recent new regulation statute to try to incentivize on several fronts that increase of utilization. And like I said, I do think our efforts are paying off as we have been continuing to educate regulators and officials that, that utilization is much more sustainable to cost containment at healthcare than the price cuts. So I think that those numbers are -- they're starting to see that, obviously, from other countries. And so I'm very encouraged. And in the meantime, we've maintained our leadership position, 30% of the market share. As John said, we're very focused on that profitable growth and believe that, obviously, when Europe does come out of this -- comes out of the storm they're in right now, that we're going to be stronger than ever and certainly benefit disproportionately from now the increase in utilization. And as far as Japan goes, yes, as I said, we did see strong results. I would say that for the year, we certainly anticipate low double-digit growth in that country. And I think that it comes from a couple of places. One, as I've said, we've continued to enhance and now reaping the benefits of the pipeline that we started to build after our acquisition. And we see those coming to fruition so we're launching more products, we're launching more internally manufactured products. So the profitability of that -- the country continues to increase. And again, utilization, we continue to see it creeping up close to the mid 20s. So all-in-all, Japan is steadily, just steadily increasing and we're very happy with our performance there."

As far as our activity, I think we laid out a lot of parameters and clarity on Investor Day, speaking to the fact that we absolutely are looking and always looking at a lot of different things, whether it's new geographies, products, therapeutic categories, bolt-on for dosage forms, certainly looking for products for our Specialty division.

So as I've talked about for a long time, that those regulations, and FDA clarified their position and the answer to the citizen petition a couple of years ago, that it's not that's same. Then it can't be rated substitutable and especially in a life – or an emergency situation. So my comments have always been around our confidence and our intellectual property around our Dragon [ph] device, the regulations at FDA and the ability to have to be the same. So if you have to retrain, it's not the same. And for obviously EpiPen and anaphylaxis, obviously reaches that hurdle of being a life saving or an emergency situation. So that again is why I underscore my confidence in the franchise and the hurdles for getting an AB-rated. I'll let John speak to ROI but what I will say is, we were -- after we saw the results from last year's DTC as well as other initiatives. Because while direct-to-consumer is certainly a large aspect, we're doing on many fronts, around this education. And obviously, if you look since Q3 of last year, you see just beyond accelerated double-digit growth year-over-year for each quarter.

And so I think that we're building a platform for the future and responsibly reinvesting in that platform so we have the right play -- the right growth in the future while at the same time managing the balance sheet in a smart way."

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world. Through their passion and hard work, we delivered very strong results this quarter. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank each and every one of them.
Our diverse global platform has once again delivered strong results, representing a great start to 2012. Double-digit growth on our North American, Asia-Pacific and Specialty businesses allowed us to deliver robust financial results despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds in certain regions, specifically Europe and Australia. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and we see opportunities for upside during the year. Further, the strength of our platforms, first-in-class science and robust product portfolio give us continued confidence in our long-term growth target for 2013 and beyond.
During the first quarter, we generated total adjusted revenues of $1.58 billion, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis as compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.52, an 18% increase over the $0.44 per share we delivered during the first quarter of '11.
In our North American Generics business, third-party net revenues for the quarter were $777 million, up more than 15% from the comparable year-ago period. This strong result was driven in part by launches of 11 new products in the U.S., including Ibandronate and Escitalopram, a first equivalent product that generated the highest and fastest conversion rate in versus generic launch we've seen in recent history. We also enjoyed strong sales in the U.S. on many of our existing products.
Further, consistent with the strength of our R&D capabilities, 2 of the 8 first quarter products submissions we made in the U.S. are first-to-file opportunities. Currently we have 171 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 40 of which are potential first to file. Regarding our neurology franchise which is one of our strategic growth drivers, we're awaiting the court's ruling in the Copaxone patent infringement case whose trial concluded in September of 2011. We remain convinced that we have an AB-rated product and look forward to securing approval in the second half of this year. While we eagerly anticipate the court's ruling and regulatory approval, I'd like to remind everybody that we are not relying on this product to achieve our 2013 target of $275 million. We also are pleased with our performance in Canada, and it's another example of the robustness of our global pipeline.
In Canada, we launched 9 products during the quarter, which is more than we launched during all of 2011. Our expanded portfolio is fueling sales and growth in our customer base, along with cost of goods efficiency that will help us weather price cuts and remain competitive and ensure consistent supply in every province.
In EMEA, as anticipated, we delivered third-party net revenues of $336 million during the quarter, a decline of approximately 14% compared to last year's first quarter results. On a constant currency basis, revenues fell 10%. New products launched throughout the region served to offset volume pressure on sales of existing products and mitigate some of the effects of unfavorable pricing.
During the quarter, we also enjoyed constant currency revenue growth of 8% in Italy, one of Europe's fastest growing markets. And in Spain, our sales volume grew along with this rapidly expanding market. Results in both cases were driven by increased generic utilization. Moreover, we remain on track to launch nearly 300 new products in Europe this year. By now, it should be very evident that our powerful global platform has and will continue to demonstrate its ability to absorb headwinds such as those occurring in Europe. Despite such headwinds, we have maintained our leadership positions in several markets such as France, Italy, Spain, U.K., Belgium and Portugal.
Moving now to our Asia-Pacific regions. We generated third-party net revenues of nearly $299 million during the first quarter, an increase of more than 8% over last year's results and 12% higher on a constant currency basis. Our double-digit growth was driven largely by the strong performance of our business in India. We continue to see growth in our third-party business and accelerated growth in our ARV franchise, both in finished dosage form and API. We currently supply to more than 90 countries. We keep expanding our ARV business by adding products and geographies and expanding market access. Further, we remain on track to launch our Commercial business in India later this year.
Finally, our Mylan Specialty business reported a 67% year-over-year increase in third-party net revenues, which totaled more than $162 million during the first quarter. This exceptional performance resulted from higher sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, another strategic growth driver. Increased volumes and favorable pricing drove the growth in sales, and we continue to see double-digit accelerated quarter-over-quarter sales growth. The settlement announced this morning with Teva only further enhances our confidence in the anticipated continued strong performance of this product and our entire Specialty franchise.
As we've stated before, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for EpiPen as only 7% or 2 million of the 28 million people estimated to be at risk for anaphylaxis actually carries one. Continually increasing public awareness is essential to ensuring access to this product for people who need it, and generating sustained market expansion. Now let me turn to some of our other important strategic growth drivers.
Our global Institutional business continues to deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate that this business can become a billion dollar franchise by 2016. We remain focused on supply chain integrity and optimization of our cost of goods; we’ve benefited and we will continue to benefit from being vertically integrated; and we now have successfully internalized the manufacture of 80% of our products globally, giving us even greater control of over our cost and quality at each point in the supply chain. We also expect significant growth in our product portfolio and are on track to launch approximately 650 products and file more than the 750 regulatory submissions globally this year. We also are pursuing external opportunities to expand our portfolio, such as our acquisition of 2 limited-competition dermatological products from Valeant earlier this year.
Looking at our respiratory platform, we have made good progress on the integration of the Pfizer business we acquired in November of 2011, and we believe we are on track to launch the first AB-rated generic version of Advair.
Finally, with respect to biogenerics, we have had productive discussions with the FDA regarding our portfolio and remain confident that we will be in the U.S. market starting in 2016. With that, I look forward to responding to your questions and will now turn the call over to John."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I remind you of Kris' comments at the beginning of the call today regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am extremely pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, a great start to what we firmly believe will be the most successful year in our company's history. Our Q1 results were achieved and our full year results will be achieved amid the macroeconomic headwinds that continue to plague Europe and in the wake of a 10% price cut in Japan and the most significant price cuts in Australian history, both of which occurred this quarter. This is a testament to the strength of our diverse global business, our first-in-class science, and our robust product portfolio.
The difficult pricing environment in several of our locations was certainly not expected -- unexpected, nor were the positive development which served to offset, and in some cases, fully mitigate the unfavorable impact. In fact, our first quarter results came in line with what we -- with that which we have forecasted in our Investor Day on February 21. Also, our current quarter results were in line with those of the fourth quarter of 2011 on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax income in the current quarter was $304 million compared to $294 million sequentially. Getting in the details, let me walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.59 billion, an increase of 10% over last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 11%. The relatively small unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to certain other functional currencies of our major operations, mainly in Europe and in India.
Included in total revenues for the current quarter is approximately $9 million of other revenue related to a clean energy investment subsidiary, which we invested in near the end of 2011 and whose activities qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Our adjusted metrics, which I'll discuss momentarily, exclude all activity related to this investment with the exception of the net tax effect related to its operation, which is included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenue for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 first quarter was a very strong 48%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior-year period. Our strong current quarter margins are primarily the result of favorable pricing on EpiPen in our Specialty segment. Within generics, gross margins remained stable as new product launches in North America served to offset the normal pricing trend in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
Our operations, particularly in Europe, continue to employ cost-savings initiatives, especially from the perspective of cost of goods sold. These efforts have proven successful, and adjusted gross margins in Europe, on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis and excluding the effect of foreign exchange, and as we anticipated, increased nearly 300 basis points despite lower sales. And while I'm certainly not going to predict when the economic situation in Europe will improve, these initiatives are expected to continue to have an incremental positive impact on our adjusted gross margin throughout 2012.
Adjusted operating income was $368 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 8% increase from Q1 2011. This is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I previously discussed, partially offset by increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $80 million, or approximately 5% of total revenues and up approximately 7% from the prior year. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending, principally amounts related to our biologics and respiratory platform, has shifted into later periods of the current year with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves, and we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $312 million or approximately 19.7% of total revenues, closer to the high end of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to our investment in our Specialty franchise, which has resulted in higher volume and increased market share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $411 million and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year. 
Moving onto our consolidated non-operating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70:30 fixed to floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
As I mentioned before, our adjusted pre-tax earnings in the current quarter was slightly favorable as compared to that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. However, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% as compared to 23% in the sequential quarter. The net result was adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter in line with that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is unchanged at 26% to 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
First quarter adjusted net income was $224 million, or $0.52 per share, an 18% increase from our Q1 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 per share and in line with that of the fourth quarter 2011 after their adjusting for and fully consistent with, our expectations from our -- and adjusting for the higher tax rate in Q1 2012.
Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 remains at $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And as I previously mentioned, and fully consistent with our expectations from our Investor Day, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the first before accelerating into the third quarter, which will be by far our strongest of the year and finishing with a fourth quarter that will propel us to our midpoint of $2.40 per share.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $67 million. This takes into account certain – account certain special items principally the exclusion of payments of approximately $90 million related to previously settled and accrued litigation primarily related to AWP and the inclusion of approximately $62 million related to amounts due in 2012, which were received in late December 2011 but excluded for adjusted cash flow purposes from that quarter.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was a cash outflow of $109 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $267 million. The first quarter is, historically, the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash and as a result of the timing of certain payments including taxes, interest and incentive optimization. But we are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion.
First quarter capital spending was $36 million and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the quarter to acquire product rights and licenses, the majority of which relates to the purchase of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant Pharmaceuticals.
During the current quarter, we repaid the $600 million due under our convertible notes and made a scheduled payment under our term loan. Both of these payments were made using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolver and through cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, which we established in February. During the first quarter, we borrowed $285 million under this facility.
At the end of the quarter, following the debt repayment and additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, our leverage ratio remains at 2.9x and we continue to have more than ample borrowing capacity.
To summarize, our first quarter was strong and was in line with what we had anticipated. This is an indication of things to come throughout what we believe will be our strongest year yet and another chapter in the exciting story that is Mylan.
That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

I think with that being said, we do see increased generic utilization beginning to increase, especially in the southern European markets. We saw growth and maintain leadership position, obviously, in Italy. And we see the same with Spain. We see that volume through increased utilization offsetting some of the price cuts. So I definitely would say that governments are beginning to realize that for sustainable cost-containment, utilization increase is a more proven, has a better track record than just cutting cost. So I would say there is some optimism that, that trend certainly will continue but again, we certainly didn't predict growth this year."

At your Analyst Day, you talked about the company's view that the financial community sort of over-estimated the potential negative impact to Mylan's numbers, if and when the generic was introduced of EpiPen. Is there anything in the agreement itself enabling Teva's entry in June 2015 that changes your expectation that a competitive generic entree would get roughly 40% of the market that would result in roughly an $0.08 to $0.12 negative impact on Mylan's bottom line? Then follow-up question for John. Just looking at the company's capital structure as it currently exist, some of the out-year debt senior notes, around, I think you're around $2.3 billion, is still sitting on the balance sheet at interest rates north of 7 1/2% and I guess given some of the recent transactions in the space and the current 0 interest rate regime across the world, I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity to refi that at more favorable rates given the company's enhanced cash flows and just stronger balance sheet position overall."

We do absolutely see the beginnings of this push for increased generic utilization as I said, kind of, throughout Southern Europe. Italy is certainly the lead of that pack, but we do -- are very encouraged by the recent new regulation statute to try to incentivize on several fronts that increase of utilization. And like I said, I do think our efforts are paying off as we have been continuing to educate regulators and officials that, that utilization is much more sustainable to cost containment at healthcare than the price cuts. So I think that those numbers are -- they're starting to see that, obviously, from other countries. And so I'm very encouraged. And in the meantime, we've maintained our leadership position, 30% of the market share. As John said, we're very focused on that profitable growth and believe that, obviously, when Europe does come out of this -- comes out of the storm they're in right now, that we're going to be stronger than ever and certainly benefit disproportionately from now the increase in utilization. And as far as Japan goes, yes, as I said, we did see strong results. I would say that for the year, we certainly anticipate low double-digit growth in that country. And I think that it comes from a couple of places. One, as I've said, we've continued to enhance and now reaping the benefits of the pipeline that we started to build after our acquisition. And we see those coming to fruition so we're launching more products, we're launching more internally manufactured products. So the profitability of that -- the country continues to increase. And again, utilization, we continue to see it creeping up close to the mid 20s. So all-in-all, Japan is steadily, just steadily increasing and we're very happy with our performance there."

I think you're electing to make 2 investments this year, 6 months of direct-to-consumer advertising and you've invested in a 100-person sales force. How do you measure those investments going forward? And what are the implications for at least the volume growth on EpiPen going forward? And then just for Heather, can you just maybe talk about the Teva device and is it the device that would prevent it from being therapeutically substituted or AB-rated if and when they ever get approved?"

So as I've talked about for a long time, that those regulations, and FDA clarified their position and the answer to the citizen petition a couple of years ago, that it's not that's same. Then it can't be rated substitutable and especially in a life – or an emergency situation. So my comments have always been around our confidence and our intellectual property around our Dragon [ph] device, the regulations at FDA and the ability to have to be the same. So if you have to retrain, it's not the same. And for obviously EpiPen and anaphylaxis, obviously reaches that hurdle of being a life saving or an emergency situation. So that again is why I underscore my confidence in the franchise and the hurdles for getting an AB-rated. I'll let John speak to ROI but what I will say is, we were -- after we saw the results from last year's DTC as well as other initiatives. Because while direct-to-consumer is certainly a large aspect, we're doing on many fronts, around this education. And obviously, if you look since Q3 of last year, you see just beyond accelerated double-digit growth year-over-year for each quarter. And obviously, this now being a record Quarter 1 for EpiPen and we see that continuing to grow. So it is absolutely, the results, I think, speak to the pay off here. And we just see that doing nothing but continuing to grow at an accelerated rate."

And the way we measure the success of the programs, whether it be the direct-to-consumer advertising campaign or the expansion in our field force, is by looking at the expansion of the market that's taking place. And that expansion of the market, we showed that on the Investor Day, has been significant. We're off to a great start for 2012. We talked on the Investor Day of the Specialty business growing 30% year-over-year for 2012. And at this point, one quarter into it, I think it's at least that."

I believe that the most responsible thing for EpiPen would be behind the counter. So it would look much more like sometimes how insulin is treated or plan B. So we believe that there is absolutely opportunity to continue to work with states because as you might imagine, there is -- all the states differ with pharmacy laws and regulations. But we are actively pursuing and looking at doing just that, working with the states, working with the FDA, to hopefully get to a place where there would be both prescription EpiPen as well as behind-the-counter EpiPen that would provide the maximum access to everybody who wanted or needed to carry an EpiPen to be able to have as many as they want and also be able to make sure, from a collaborative perspective that whether it's schools being covered, soccer fields, football as you might imagine, that not only it’s important to have the schools equipped, which we're launching a huge program here in the next couple of months with schools, but also everything in the community related to that.

And the question is, is there -- how do we think about that? You guys are spending a lot more than your peers in terms of percentage of cash flow on CapEx.

So as you look, we are investing, obviously, across the board whether it's on our API, whether it's in the finished dosage form facilities, but doubling that capacity, we believe is, again, just goes to the diversity of our platform, our ability to absorb whatever, headwind, countries, issues. That, that ability to not only invest from an R&D perspective and we talked a lot about our product portfolio doubling. And when you think about not only doubling, it's the quality of what we're doubling and the kind of products, again, our respiratory announcement. Our ability to have the dollars and invest the dollars we believe is another barrier to entry because we're using large dollar investments, whether it's respiratory, whether it's biogenerics, doubling our size.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and entire management team, I would like to congratulate them on a job well done. 
Mylan had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit top line and bottom line year-over-year growth. Sales were about $1.7 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis. And our adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% from the same prior year quarter to $0.60 a share. Building on our strong first quarter, this stellar performance supports our confidence that 2012 will be the best year-to-date in Mylan's history, with many more to come. 
Among the second quarter highlights were growth of more than 50% in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our ARV franchise. Our performance this quarter was strong compared to last year second quarter when we had several very significant product launches. Further, we delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform through increased R&D and sales and marketing programs. In addition, our gross margin was also almost half a percentage point. 
We also saw improvement in some European countries, constant currency, third-party net sales in our EMEA region were down about 3% year-over-year, a smaller decline that we've seen in recent quarters. EMEA top line was essentially flat from Q1 to Q2 this year. These results are yet another demonstration of our ability to manage our global platform for growth by optimizing new launches and seizing opportunities as we continue to build our base business and effectively manage pricing pressures. it's against this factor that we look forward to the third quarter, which we project to be by far is the strongest of the year, and a fourth quarter that is similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. 
We are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share as well as 2013 target of $2.75. 
Earlier this year, when we hosted our Investor Day, we outlined plan was strategic growth drivers. I'd like to walk you through several of them now and comment on results achieved or progress made during the second quarter. Our core growth drivers is our global operating platform, which we continue to leverage this quarter. In our North America generics business, third-party net sales for the quarter were $845 million, up 13% from the year ago period, more than 70% of these sales come from existing products with the remainder coming from multiple new launches. In the U.S., drivers in the quarter included Escitalopram, Doryx and which is enjoying an 180 days of exclusivity. We also look forward to important launches throughout the rest of the year, including Modafinil. For our settlement with Teva, we may launch our product on August 10, which is prior to the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period for We also expect to launch active 
In Canada, our robust pipeline has produced 17 new product launches thus far in 2012, an unprecedented number for us, and we expect to sustain a similar level annually through at least 2015. Among our more significant second quarter launches were Crestor and
In EMEA, constant currency, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled $327 million, which as I mentioned earlier, represented a decline of about 3% year-over-year. Nearly 90% of these outcomes from existing products, with the remainder coming from new product introduction throughout the region which included Lipitor, Ibandronate, which is our first the generic ARV launched in Europe. 
while existing product volume remained flat year-over-year, pricing was as expected, lower due to government action and ongoing pressure. In this environment, we continue to manage our cost structure aggressively through vertical integration, repatriation of products and other measures taken to manage and reduce cost of goods sold. 
In both Italy and Spain, we experienced double-digit constant currency sales growth year-over-year due to higher volume on existing products and new product launches, which offset rising impact. In addition to Italy and Spain, we saw some growth in smaller countries. And in Germany, our enhanced cost structure continue to allow us to compete in multiple tenders. 
In our Asia-Pacific region, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled nearly $308 million, and 9% constant currency increase. The primary driver of this growth was our ARV franchise. In Japan, higher volumes continue to offset price cuts that went into effect on April 1 and of which the market began adjusting during the first quarter. 
Our third-party sales in Australia slowed slightly as new product revenue and favorable volume and mix nearly offset the impact of price cuts of nearly 25% made in the second quarter by Australia pharmaceutical benefit scheme and a significant agencies history. 
As for our Specialty business, second quarter performance was very strong. Sales rose 51% year-over-year to almost $200 million. Year-over-year sales for the first half of 2012 were up 58%. 
Domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector accounted for most of this increase driven by unprecedented script expansion and ongoing growth of the anaphylactic marketplace. Performance sales also grew, and the product continues to do well in all 4 major channels, retail, home health care, hospitals and long-term care. The nebulizer level market in the us is expected to expand about 15% this year and 10% in 2013. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the market. 
We also were pleased to announce in May that we had entered into settlement agreements with Sanofi and concerning their product. 
Moving onto our other strategic growth drivers, we continue to believe we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing measures being taken to boost generic utilization. In the last year, utilization has increased in several European countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, as government modified reimbursement practices. Recently in France, for instance, when a consumer wants to but a certain brand of products, he must pay for them out of pocket and then get reimbursed for as if he is willing to accept the generic alternative, he will pay nothing. 
In addition, Japan continues to represent a significant opportunity. Over the last 12 months, Japan has experienced growth in generic utilization which now stands at about 24%. 
As for our global Institutional business, we continue to invest in research and development and in additional capacity, which will allow us to increase the vertical integration of this business and support the future double-digit sales growth we expect. In addition, year-to-date in the U.S., we have received approvals on 5 injectable products, and we launched several products throughout the rest of the world. 
Moving onto our ARV franchise. We continue to strengthen our position as a market leader with our new and innovative dosage forms, and our portfolio now contains 43 products. Currently, approximately 1/3 of all HIV patients being treated in the developing world for the disease rely on a Mylan product. 
With respect to geographic expansion, we look forward this summer to launching our commercial business in India. And initially, we'll concentrate on certain therapeutic categories, starting with our ARV portfolio. We also are pleased with the progress we are making in our export markets, and we are on track to this year to file 150 dossiers in countries around the globe. 
Portfolio diversity, continues to be an important driver of our business. Year-to-date, we've launched about 300 products, and we're on track to launch approximately 350 more by year end. As we have continued to diversify, today we offer a wide variety of dosage forms with oral solids making up only about 57% of our portfolio. Examples of other forms include injectables, patches, softgel caps, dermatologies, respiratory and liquids. 
In neurology, earlier this year, lower courts ruled against us in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively on Copaxone and we intend to appeal those decisions. We remain confident in our application and expect to receive FDA approval before we have the ability to launch our product, given the anticipated length of the appeals process.
Turning to our respiratory franchise, we continue to be on track and expect to launch generic Advair in 2015 in Europe and in 2016 in the U.S. We also continue to invest in internal respiratory capabilities in Ireland. In addition, the development of our COPD combination product remains on track. 
As for biogenerics, our product development remains on track and we look forward to commercializing affordable products globally. 
Finally, earlier this month, we applauded the signing of the Food and Drug Administration and Innovation Act, which received near unanimous bipartisan support in Congress. had long been a passionate leader and an advocate for many pieces of legislation, which updates the 1938 law governing FDA to help protect the health and safety of its consumers by requiring all facilities that supply product in the U.S., regardless of where they're located, be routinely expected by the agency and have one quality standard. Through the landmark generic drug user fee program, the new law also will help expedite approvals of generic drugs by reducing review times of ANDAs from 31 months to 10 months over the next 5 years. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter's results in more detail, and I will look forward to responding to your questions."
290203,213782906,331504,"Mylan, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morn, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comment at the beginning of today's ca",2078,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morn, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. 
I am pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2012 which are in line with our expectations. As you'll recall, in early May, we increased and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2012 from $2.30 to $2.50 per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. With the exception of our fully diluted share count, which I'll speak about in a few minutes, our other guidance metrics remains unchanged and I'll walk through each of them today.
Our Q2 results reflect double-digit growth on the top line and the bottom line, excluding the effects of foreign currency and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing programs, both of which also grew by double digits. 
As Heather discussed previously, our ability to continually introduce new products, in particular this quarter Doryx in the U.S. and Lipitor worldwide, has served to mitigate some of the challenges of the macroeconomic environment in Europe, as well as government-mandated price reduction which took place in Japan and Australia earlier in the year. We continue to manage against these macro economic headwinds and remain poised to achieve our forecasted full year result while also fully absorbing their impact. 
Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. Starting in the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 12%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to many of the other functional currencies of our major operations but mainly in Europe and India. 
For the first half of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% over revenues from the first half of 2011 or 12% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 million. 
Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this revenue range as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates is estimated to have an unfavorable impact approaching $200 million. 
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 second quarter was a very strong 48.5%, a 30 basis point increase over the same prior year period. This increase was driven by favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector and by new product launches, partially offset by lower margin on existing products. 
The current quarter also saw margin improvement in Asia-Pacific. Sales and gross profit from Mylan Laboratory Limited, our Indian subsidiary, benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of it sales is denominated in U.S. dollars. 
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 48.3% as compared to 47.7% in the prior year. Our guidance range for adjusted gross margin is 48% to 50%. We currently expect our gross margin in the second half of 2012 could potentially be above or at the upper end of our guidance range, and as a result, our full year gross margin to be at the upper end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted operating income was $398 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 4% increase from a very strong Q2 2011 and up 8% from the first quarter of 2012. This increase, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I've just discussed, was realized in spite of R&D expense for the quarter -- was realized by an increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis was $93 million or approximately 5.5% of total revenues, and up approximately 29% from the prior year and 39% on a constant currency basis. This increase was realized mainly as a result of ongoing clinical studies with respect to our respiratory and Biologics programs. 
At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, with $328 million for the quarter, or approximately 19.4% of total revenues, and up approximately 9% over the prior year or 13% on a constant currency basis. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased sales and marketing in our Specialty franchise, in particular for the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which has resulted in overall growth of the anaphylaxis market. 
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.3%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5%  and 6.5% of total revenues. We expect R&D spending to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year primarily related to our biologic and respiratory platforms, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be within our guidance range. 
SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, was $640 million, an increase of nearly 13% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, albeit at the high end as the result of the increased sales and marketing spend.
Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million and $859 million for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year.
I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the one-off items that are being excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. In April, we entered into a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement with our production employees in Morgantown, West Virginia. In can junction with this new agreement, we incurred approximately $15 million of cost including amounts associated with our planned withdrawal from a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan. Second, we incurred approximately $14 million of restructuring cost associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Napa, California. This amount relates to severance and related benefits. 
And finally, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $16 million, which represented an increase to our contingent consideration liability with respect to our acquisition of Pfizer's respiratory platform. Approximately half of this amount relates to the accretion of the liability to its undiscounted value, which would occur each quarter.
Moving onto our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter of 2012 was $61 million. As of June 30, 2012, the average rate on outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 exploding debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. During Q2, we entered into forward starting financial instrument to extent to 2016 the period of over which we will maintain our 70-30 exploding ratio of our debt portfolio, as well as our average effective interest rate. 
Adjusted interest expense for the 6-month period was $122 million, and is forecasted to be between $245 million and $265 million for the full year. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward. 
Second quarter adjusted net income was $254 million, or $0.60 per share, a 15% increase from our Q2 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 per share. For the 6 months, adjusted net income was $478 million, or $1.12 per share, a 17% increase over the same prior year period. 
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for diluted EPS is now $2.45 to $2.55 per share. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million share repurchase program under which we repurchased 23.4 million shares at an average cost of $21.36 per share. The impact of this share repurchase program is included in our calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a weighted basis and to approximately $0.01 for the current quarter. Our revised estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million shares.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release and which I discussed in detail in our first quarter earnings call, was approximately $282 million for the quarter and $349 million per for the year-to-date period. In addition to cash-based previously accrued litigation, which is excluded from adjusted cash from operations, we have also excluding cash received during the quarter with respect to the settlement of a patent litigation matter. 
Also in the quarter, Mylan and settled outstanding litigation with respect to product. As a result of this settlement, Mylan is licensed to continue sales of its concentrate product and will have a loyalty bearing license nonpositive product upon receiving final FDA approval from the U.S. FDA. The settlement also releases Mylan from payment of the $18 million in damages that has been awarded by a jury earlier this year. The penal impact of these items as well as a few miscellaneous other litigation matters was income of $12.2 million for the quarter, all of which is excluded from our adjusted earnings. 
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $302 million and $193 million, respectively, and leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $347 million at June 30, 2012. We are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion driven by increased second half earnings, as well as increased cash received receipts from accounts receivable related to our significant recent product launches. 
Second quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date to nearly $100 million. And as a result of the timing of cutting capital expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the first half of 2012 to acquire product rights and licenses.
During the current quarter, we borrowed $365 million under our revolving credit facility do this along with cash on hand and through cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, we used to fund the share repurchase program, which I previously discussed. In July 2012, the size of the accounts receivable securitization facility was increased to $400 million. 
Even with the additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, we continue to have a significant financial flexibility. Our leverage ratio at the June 30, 2012, as a result of the additional borrowings was 3.09 to 1, which is slightly above our long-term target of 3 to 1. However, we expect to be back below 3 to 1 by December 31, 2012. As such, we will continue to evaluate the uses of free cash flow for transaction based on the parameters which we've to you in the past. 
Additionally, I'm pleased that in May, Mylan's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to BA1 from BA2. And following this action, Moody's rating outlook is stable. This change is reflective of Mylan's track record of meeting our prior stated commitment, as well as our solid position within the global generic industry, in particular our strong geographic diversification and robust product pipeline. 
To summarize, our second quarter, much like our first, was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. This positions us well heading into what will be an exciting second half of the year, culminating in what should be our strongest year yet. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Beverly?"

We certainly are getting positive indicators. And starting with France, our, as you know our largest market, we continue to take initiatives to increase utilization, we see those starting to take hold. We see volumes holding. So that ability of perhaps turning the quarter, maybe throughout the rest of this year, we will see a trend. But what I can tell you, we have our arms around what we can control, our cost of goods structure, our continual repatriation and vertical integration has benefited us. And that's said in the past, once that market started to turn around, we certainly, we get our disproportionate share because of what we've been doing during these headwinds. Italy and Spain continue to be -- show a lot of growth, especially in volume. So while there continues to be austerity measures and price impact, we see that volume in our product mix and our ability to continue to grow those markets as very promising. So I think when you look overall, of where there's still see -- where we still see opportunity is utilization being a much better offset the cost containment than just slashing prices. And as when you look at some of the other European countries that are much more mature in like the U.K., it's not opportunity for utilization. They're pretty mature market, so that's to maintain in some of those areas is very different than some of the growth opportunities we see for our strong. And then let's turn to the Asia-Pacific. Yes, Australia continue to see price pressure as one of the most significant to date with this 25%. I will tell you, we continuously have them since it 2008 when I believe they took the first big hit to pricing to right size of the organization because remain very nimble and agile and be able to adapt to the changing environment. We continue to invest in our R&D and product launches and cost of goods structure, which we'll continue to do, which has helped us hold and offset that price cut. As you mentioned, Japan had a nice increase. And again, we see opportunity, we see utilization for that country at about 24%. As you know the government has talked about getting that up to at least 30% here in the very near so again, continuing to capture some of that growth and as I mentioned, our growth driver be our ARV franchise out of our India subsidiary. And that continues to grow nicely and we continue to be a very competitive and market leader around tenders throughout the world."

So our ability to whether the storm that Europe's been going through and come out on the other side stronger, much better cost of goods structure and a position to compete much better than any regional or local player that doesn't have the benefit of the global scale that the Mylan platform has.

I would also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of",1590,"Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to congratulate them on a job well done.
Mylan had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit top line and bottom line year-over-year growth. Sales were about $1.7 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis, and our adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% from the same prior year quarter to $0.60 a share. Building on our strong first quarter, this stellar performance supports our confidence that 2012 will be the best year-to-date in Mylan's history, with many more to come.
Among the second quarter's highlights were growth of more than 50% in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our ARV franchise. Our performance this quarter was strong compared to last year's second quarter when we had several very significant product launches. Further, we delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform through increased R&D and sales and marketing programs. In addition, our gross margin was up almost half a percentage point.
We also saw improvement in some European countries. Constant currency third-party net sales in our EMEA region were down about 3% year-over-year, a smaller decline than we've seen in recent quarters. EMEA's top line was essentially flat from Q1 to Q2 of this year. These results are yet another demonstration of our ability to manage our global platform for growth by optimizing new launches and seizing opportunities as we continue to build our base business and effectively manage pricing pressures. It's against this factor of that we look forward to the third quarter, which we project to be by far our strongest of the year, and a fourth quarter that is similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. We are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our 2013 target of $2.75.
Earlier this year, when we hosted our Investor Day, we outlined Mylan's strategic growth drivers. I'd like to walk you through several of them now and comment on results achieved or progress made during the second quarter. Our core growth driver is our global operating platform, which we continue to leverage this quarter. In our North America generics business, third-party net sales for the quarter were $845 million, up 13% from the comparable year ago period. More than 70% of these sales come from existing products, with the remainder coming from multiple new launches.
In the U.S., drivers in the quarter included Escitalopram, Doryx and Evicabir [ph], which is enjoying 180 days of exclusivity. We also look forward to important launches throughout the rest of the year, including Modafinil. For our settlement with Teva, we may launch our product on August 10, which is prior to the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period brand [indiscernible]. We also expect to launch Actos, Actoplus Met and [indiscernible].
In Canada, our robust pipeline has produced 17 new product launches thus far in 2012, an unprecedented number for us, and we expect to sustain a similar level annually through at least 2015. Among our more significant second quarter launches were Crestor and
[indiscernible].
In EMEA, constant currency third-party net sales for the quarter totaled $327 million which, as I mentioned earlier, represented a decline of about 3% year-over-year. Nearly 90% of these outcomes from existing products, with the remainder coming from new product introductions throughout the region which included Lipitor, [indiscernible], Ibandronate, Lamivudine, which is our first generic ARV launched in Europe.
While existing product volume remained flat year-over-year pricing was, as expected, lower due to government action and ongoing competitive pressure. In this environment, we continue to manage our cost structure aggressively through vertical integration, repatriation of product and other measures taken to manage and reduce cost of goods sold.
In both Italy and Spain, we experienced double-digit constant currency sales growth year-over-year due to higher volumes on existing products and new product launches, which offset pricing impact. In addition to Italy and Spain, we saw some growth in smaller countries. And in Germany, our enhanced cost structure continue to allow us to compete in multiple tenders.
In our Asia-Pacific region, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled nearly $308 million and 9% constant currency increase. The primary driver of this growth was our ARV franchise. In Japan, higher volumes continue to offset price cuts that went into effect on April 1, and of which the market began adjusting during the first quarter.
Our third-party sales in Australia slowed slightly as new product revenue and favorable volume and mix nearly offset the impact of price cuts of nearly 25% made in the second quarter by Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the significant agent [indiscernible].
As for our Specialty business, our second quarter performance was very strong. Sales rose 51% year-over-year to almost $200 million. Year-over-year sales for the first half of 2012 were up 58%.
Domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector accounted for most of this increase, driven by unprecedented script to expansion and ongoing growth of the anaphylaxis marketplace. Performance sales also grow, and the product continues to do well in all 4 major channels: retail, home health care, hospitals and long-term care. The nebulized LABA market in the U.S. is expected to expand about 15% this year and 10% in 2013. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the market. We also were pleased to announce in May that we had entered into settlement agreements with Sanofi and concerning their [indiscernible] products.
Moving on to our other strategic growth drivers, we continue to believe we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing measures being taken to boost generic utilization. In the last year, utilization has increased in several European countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, as governments modify reimbursement practices. Recently in France, for instance, when a consumer wants to buy a certain brand of product, he must pay for them out of pocket and then get reimbursed, whereas if he's willing to accept the generic alternative, he will pay nothing.
In addition, Japan continues to represent a significant opportunity. Over the last 12 months, Japan has experienced growth in generic utilization, which now stands at about 24%.
As for our global Institutional business, we continue to invest in research and development and an additional capacity, which will allow us to increase the vertical integration of this business and support the future double-digit sales growth we expect. In addition, year-to-date in the U.S., we have received approvals on 5 injectable products, and we launched several products throughout the rest of the world.
Moving on to our ARV franchise. We continue to strengthen our position as the market leader with our new and innovative dosage forms, and our portfolio now contains 43 products. Currently, approximately 1/3 of all HIV patients being treated in the developing world for the disease rely on a Mylan product.
With respect to geographic expansion, we look forward this summer to launching our commercial business in India. And initially, we'll concentrate on certain therapeutic categories, starting with our ARV portfolio. We also are pleased with progress we are making in our export markets, and we are on track to this year to file 150 dossiers in countries around the globe.
Portfolio diversity continues to be an important driver of our business. Year-to-date, we've launched about 300 products, and we're on track to launch approximately 350 more by year end. As we have continued to diversify, today we offer a wide variety of dosage forms, with oral solids making up only about 57% of our portfolio. Examples of other forms include injectables, ophthalmic, patches, soft gel caps, dermatologics, respiratory and liquids.
In neurology, earlier this year, lower courts ruled against us in the U.S. and U.K., respectively on Copaxone, and we intend to appeal those decisions. We remain confident in our application and expect to receive FDA approval before we have the ability to launch our product, given the anticipated length of the appeals process.
Turning to our respiratory franchise. We continue to be on track and expect to launch generic Advair in 2015 in Europe and in 2016 in the U.S. We also continue to invest in internal respiratory capabilities in Ireland. In addition, the development of our COPD combination product remains on track.
As for biogenerics, our product development remains on track, and we look forward to commercializing affordable products globally. 
Finally, earlier this month, we applauded the signing of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA,  which received near-unanimous bipartisan support in Congress. Mylan has long been a passionate leader and an advocate for many pieces of the legislation, which updates the 1938 law governing FDA to help protect the health and safety of consumers by requiring that all facilities that supply product in the U.S., regardless of where they're located, be routinely inspected by the agency and have the one quality standard. Through the landmark Generic Drug User Fee program, the new law also will help expedite approvals of generic drugs by reducing review times of ANDA from 31 months to 10 months over the next 5 years.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss this quarter's results in more detail, and I look forward to responding to your questions."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today'",2098,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2012, which are in line with our expectations. As you'll recall, in early May, we increased and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2012 from $2.30 to $2.50 per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. With the exception of our fully diluted share count, which I'll speak about in a few minutes, our other guidance metrics remains unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them today.
Our Q2 results reflect double-digit growth on the top line and bottom line, excluding the effects of foreign currency, and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing programs, both of which also grew by double digits.
As Heather discussed previously, our ability to continually introduce new products, in particular this quarter Doryx in the U.S., Lipitor worldwide, has served to mitigate some of the challenges of the macroeconomic environment in Europe, as well as government-mandated price reductions, which took place in Japan and Australia earlier in the year. We continue to manage against these macroeconomic headwinds and remain poised to achieve our forecasted full year result while also fully absorbing their impact.
Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 12%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to many of the other functional currencies of our major operations but mainly in Europe and India.
For the first half of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% over revenues from the first half of 2011 or 12% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this revenue range as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates is estimated to have an unfavorable impact approaching $200 million.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 second quarter was a very strong 48.5%, a 30 basis point increase over the same prior year period. This increase was driven by favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector and by new product launches, partially offset by lower margins on existing products.
The current quarter also saw margin improvement in Asia Pacific. Sales and gross profit from Mylan Laboratories Limited, our Indian subsidiary, benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee, as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 48.3% as compared to 47.7% in the prior year. Our guidance range for adjusted gross margin is 48% to 50%. We currently expect our gross margin in the second half of 2012 could potentially be above or at the upper end of our guidance range and as a result, our full year gross margin to be at the upper end of our guidance range.
Adjusted operating income was $398 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 4% increase from a very strong Q2 2011 and up 8% from the first quarter of 2012. This increase, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I just discussed, was realized in spite of R&D expense for the -- was realized in spite of increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis, was $93 million or approximately 5.5% of total revenues and up approximately 29% from the prior year and 39% on a constant currency basis. This increase was realized mainly as a result of ongoing clinical studies with respect to our respiratory and biologics programs.
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $328 million for the quarter or approximately 19.4% of total revenues, and up approximately 9% over the prior year or 13% on a constant currency basis. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased sales and marketing in our Specialty franchise, in particular for the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which has resulted in the overall growth of the anaphylaxis market.
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.3%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. We expect R&D spending to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year, primarily related to our biologic and respiratory platforms, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, was $640 million, an increase of nearly 13% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, albeit at the high end as a result of the increased sales and marketing spend.
Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million and $859 million for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year.
I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the one-off items that are being excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. In April, we entered into a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement with our production employees in Morgantown, West Virginia. In conjunction with this new agreement, we incurred approximately $15 million of cost including amounts associated with our planned withdrawal from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Second, we incurred approximately $14 million of restructuring cost principally associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Napa, California. This amount relates principally to severance and related benefits.
And finally, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $16 million, which represented an increase to our contingent consideration liability with respect to our acquisition of Pfizer's respiratory platform. Approximately half of this amount relates to the accretion of a liability to its undiscounted value, which would occur each quarter.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter of 2012 was $61 million. As of June 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. During Q2, we entered into forward starting derivative financial instruments to extend to 2016 the period over which we will maintain our 70-30 fixed floating ratio of our debt portfolio, as well as our average effective interest rate.
Adjusted interest expense for the 6-month period was $122 million, and is forecasted to be between $245 million and $265 million for the full year. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
Second quarter adjusted net income was $254 million, or $0.60 per share, a 15% increase from our Q2 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 per share. For the 6 months, adjusted net income was $478 million or $1.12 per share, a 17% increase over the same prior year period.
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for diluted EPS is now $2.45 to $2.55 per share. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million share repurchase program under which we repurchased 23.4 million shares at an average cost of $21.36 per share. The impact of this share repurchase program is included in our calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a weighted basis and now to approximately $0.01 for the current quarter. Our revised estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million shares.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release and which I discussed in detail in our first quarter earnings call, was approximately $282 million for the quarter and $349 million for the year-to-date period. In addition, the cash paid to settle previously accrued litigation, which is excluded from adjusted cash from operations, we have also excluded cash received during the quarter with respect to the settlement of a patent litigation matter.
Also during the quarter, Mylan and Sunovion settled outstanding litigation with respect to Sunovion's Xopenex product. As a result of this settlement, Mylan is licensed to continue sales of its concentrate product and will have a loyalty bearing license to sell its non-concentrate  product upon receiving final FDA approval from the U.S. FDA. The settlement also releases Mylan from payment of the $18 million in damages that has been awarded by a jury earlier this year. The net penal impact of these items, as well as a few miscellaneous other litigation matters, was an income of $12.2 million for the quarter, all of which is excluded from our adjusted earnings.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $302 million and $193 million, respectively, and leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $347 million at June 30, 2012. We are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion, driven by increased second half earnings, as well as increased cash receipts from accounts receivable related to our significant recent product launches.
Second quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date to nearly $100 million. And as a result of the timing of planned capital expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the first half of 2012 to acquire product rights and licenses.
During the current quarter, we borrowed $365 million under our revolving credit facility. This, along with cash on hand and through cash received through our -- from our accounts receivable securitization facility, was used to fund the share repurchase program, which I previously discussed. In July 2012, the size of the accounts receivable securitization facility was increased to $400 million.
Even with the additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, we continue to have a significant financial flexibility. Our leverage ratio at June 30, 2012, as a result of the additional borrowings was 3.09 to 1, which is slightly above our long-term target of 3 to 1. However, we expect to be back below 3 to 1 by December 31, 2012. As such, we will continue to revaluate the uses of free cash flow for transactions based on the parameters, which we've outlined to you in the past.
Additionally, I am pleased that in May, Mylan's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Ba1 from Ba2. And following this action, Moody's rating outlook is stable. This change is reflective of Mylan's track record of meeting our prior stated commitments, as well as our solid position within the global generic industry, in particular, our strong geographic diversification and robust product pipeline.
To summarize, our second quarter, much like our first, was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. This positions us well heading into what will be an exciting second half of the year, culminating in what should be our strongest year yet.
That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Beverly?"

Look, I think that -- I want to be careful about not talking about this quarter as a trend yet in Europe, but I will say this. We certainly are getting positive indicators. And starting with France, our, as you know, largest market, we continue to see and take initiatives, increased utilization. We see those starting to take hold. We see volumes holding. So that ability of perhaps turning the quarter, maybe throughout the rest of this year, we will see a trend. But what I can tell you, we have our arms around what we can control, our cost of goods structure, our continual repatriation and vertical integration has benefited us. And that said in the past, once that market started to turn around, we -- certainly, we get our disproportionate share because of what we've been doing during these headwinds. Italy and Spain continue to be -- show a lot of growth, especially in volume. So while there continues to be austerity measures and price impact, we see that volume in our product mix and our ability to continue to grow those markets as very promising. So I think when you look overall of where there's still see -- or where we still see opportunity as the utilization being a much better offset the cost containment than just slashing prices. And as -- when you look at some of the other European countries that are much more mature, like the U.K., there is not that opportunity for utilization. They are pretty mature markets, so that to maintain in some of those areas is very different than some of the growth opportunities we see for our strong [indiscernible]. And then let's turn to the Asia Pacific. Yes, Australia continue to see price pressure as one of the most significant to date with the 25%. I will tell you, we continuously have them since 2008 when I believe they took the first big hit on pricing to rightsize that organization to remain very nimble and agile and be able to adapt to the changing environment. We've continued to invest in our R&D and product launches and cost of goods structure, which we'll continue to do, which has helped us hold and offset that price cut. As you mentioned, Japan had a nice increase. And again, we see opportunity. We see utilization for that country at about 24%. As you know the government has talked about getting that up to at least 30% here in the very near term, so again, continuing to capture some of that growth. And as I mentioned, our world driver being our ARV franchise out of our India subsidiary. And that continues to grow nicely, and we continue to be a very competitive market leader around tenders throughout the world."

And hopefully, with people have been able to start gaining confidence in our ability to be not only laying out guidance and potential targets but our ability to meet or exceed them. So I think as we came out Investor Day with a whole assortment of opportunities that are drivers for 2013 and beyond because, as you mentioned, we need to work today on those things. So whether it's EpiPen, yes, there's a possibility there could be [indiscernible]. While I remain fairly confident that, that's going to be a high hurdle, we have many, many other opportunities. I mean, when we talk about biologics, Advair, Copaxone, all definitely coming after that 2015 time period, not to mention our continuous voluminous amount of launches across the board. That's why today in my remarks, I tried to lay out not only what the platform is generating but with all the different strategic drivers that we discussed that all give benefits. So you don't have to rely on all of them hitting obviously just a couple of them hitting certainly put at great growth to Mylan from this point going forward. And I guess the other thing I'd say on your comment about integration, I could say that our Merck acquisition certainly is in a hemisphere all by itself. When you buy a company 2.5x your size and do a transformational acquisition as we did, certainly that integration, I think took a couple of 3 years that we certainly were able and continue to show every step along the way our ability to realize those synergies. I think when you look at acquisitions outside of that, we've certainly stated we're not doing a large 2.5x our size transformative acquisition. So things like Bioniche respiratory franchise from Pfizer, we've continued to be able to bolt and tuck those in without ever even mentioning integration or missing a beat because I think the platform we have in place today is scalable and sustainable and is able to absorb these kind of acquisitions very, very easily. So there's not a long-term planning period for any of those."

We don't speak specifically before launches in Europe as you know. There's some competitive advantage, and it's not the same system that gives the same visibility, like here in the United States with Paragraph IV. But I can tell you, we've had very successful launches already this year, as I spoke about Torvistart [ph] and Canvistart [ph] and then Ibandronate. And like I said, we continue to have many more. Our total R&D portfolio and filings, we look to be doubling our size by 2015. So I mean, that should give you a sense of the amount of products that we have in the pipeline or already filed with regulatory agencies around the world of what we're going to be launching over the next couple of years. As far as Paragraph IV goes, I mean, certainly, we have been showing, like we did back in Investor Day, the state certain launches that we already know of or our first-to-file, share to file opportunities, 2012 was one of our largest years as far as the states certain so far been, but we continue to already be -- have settlements that go out through '13, '14, '15 of date certain. We continue to get our share of first-to-file opportunities. So I would just say that we continue to maximize and leverage our platform on all of the fronts that we have in the past. Difficult-to-formulate products, the Paragraph IV opportunity and, like I said, just a voluminous amount of dosage forms. And we are investing in everything from injectables, as I mentioned earlier, to our patches, at oral, solid dose soft gels, dermatologicals. So as far as from an M&A, when you think about -- we really have a lot of opportunity to complement this platform across the globe, from our Specialty division to continue to complement our infrastructure and disease state expertise in respiratory and allergy. You look at our Biologics partnerships and our ability to continue to leverage and build upon that, as well as therapeutic categories that we're not in yet. So we see an opportunity to still bid our U.S. generics business with things like whether it would be antibiotics or dermatological things that we're not as large in today. So across the board, I would say, we have many opportunities to continue to fuel the engine that we've put together across all of the fronts I just mentioned."

Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to congratulate them on a job well done.
Mylan had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit top line and bottom line year-over-year growth. Sales were about $1.7 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis, and our adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% from the same prior year quarter to $0.60 a share. Building on our strong first quarter, this stellar performance supports our confidence that 2012 will be the best year-to-date in Mylan's history, with many more to come.
Among the second quarter's highlights were growth of more than 50% in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our ARV franchise. Our performance this quarter was strong compared to last year's second quarter when we had several very significant product launches. Further, we delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform through increased R&D and sales and marketing programs. In addition, our gross margin was up almost half a percentage point.
We also saw improvement in some European countries. Constant currency third-party net sales in our EMEA region were down about 3% year-over-year, a smaller decline than we've seen in recent quarters. EMEA's top line was essentially flat from Q1 to Q2 of this year. These results are yet another demonstration of our ability to manage our global platform for growth by optimizing new launches and seizing opportunities as we continue to build our base business and effectively manage pricing pressures. It's against this factor of that we look forward to the third quarter, which we project to be by far our strongest of the year, and a fourth quarter that is similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. We are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our 2013 target of $2.75.
Earlier this year, when we hosted our Investor Day, we outlined Mylan's strategic growth drivers. I'd like to walk you through several of them now and comment on results achieved or progress made during the second quarter. Our core growth driver is our global operating platform, which we continue to leverage this quarter. In our North America generics business, third-party net sales for the quarter were $845 million, up 13% from the comparable year ago period. More than 70% of these sales come from existing products, with the remainder coming from multiple new launches.
In the U.S., drivers in the quarter included Escitalopram, Doryx and Abacavir, which is enjoying 180 days of exclusivity. We also look forward to important launches throughout the rest of the year, including Modafinil. For our settlement with Teva, we may launch our product on August 10, which is prior to the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period brand of Teva. We also expect to launch Actos, Actoplus Met and [indiscernible].
In Canada, our robust pipeline has produced 17 new product launches thus far in 2012, an unprecedented number for us, and we expect to sustain a similar level annually through at least 2015. Among our more significant second quarter launches were Crestor and
Tracleer.
In EMEA, constant currency third-party net sales for the quarter totaled $327 million which, as I mentioned earlier, represented a decline of about 3% year-over-year. Nearly 90% of these outcomes from existing products, with the remainder coming from new product introductions throughout the region which included Lipitor, Candesartan, Ibandronate, Lamivudine, which is our first generic ARV launched in Europe.
While existing product volume remained flat year-over-year, pricing was as expected, lower due to government action and ongoing competitive pressure. In this environment, we continue to manage our cost structure aggressively through vertical integration, repatriation of product and other measures taken to manage and reduce cost of goods sold.
In both Italy and Spain, we experienced double-digit constant currency sales growth year-over-year due to higher volumes on existing products and new product launches, which offset pricing impact. In addition to Italy and Spain, we saw some growth in smaller countries. And in Germany, our enhanced cost structure continue to allow us to compete in multiple tenders.
In our Asia-Pacific region, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled nearly $308 million and 9% constant currency increase. The primary driver of this growth was our ARV franchise. In Japan, higher volumes continue to offset price cuts that went into effect on April 1, and of which the market began adjusting during the first quarter.
Our third-party sales in Australia fell slightly as new product revenue and favorable volume and mix nearly offset the impact of price cuts of nearly 25% made in the second quarter by Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and most significant agency's history [ph].
As for our Specialty business, our second quarter performance was very strong. Sales rose 51% year-over-year to almost $200 million. Year-over-year sales for the first half of 2012 were up 58%.
Domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector accounted for most of this increase, driven by unprecedented script to expansion and ongoing growth of the anaphylaxis marketplace. Performance sales also grew, and the product continues to do well in all 4 major channels: retail, home health care, hospitals and long-term care. The nebulized LABA market in the U.S. is expected to expand about 15% this year and 10% in 2013. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the market. We also were pleased to announce in May that we had entered into settlement agreements with Sanofi and concerning their Pravana [ph] products.
Moving on to our other strategic growth drivers, we continue to believe we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing measures being taken to boost generic utilization. In the last year, utilization has increased in several European countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, as governments modify reimbursement practices. Recently in France, for instance, when a consumer wants to buy a certain brand of product, he must pay for them out of pocket and then get reimbursed, whereas if he's willing to accept the generic alternative, he will pay nothing.
In addition, Japan continues to represent a significant opportunity. Over the last 12 months, Japan has experienced growth in generic utilization, which now stands at about 24%.
As for our global Institutional business, we continue to invest in research and development and an additional capacity, which will allow us to increase the vertical integration of this business and support the future double-digit sales growth we expect. In addition, year-to-date in the U.S., we have received approvals on 5 injectable products, and we launched several products throughout the rest of the world.
Moving on to our ARV franchise. We continue to strengthen our position as the market leader with our new and innovative dosage forms, and our portfolio now contains 43 products. Currently, approximately 1/3 of all HIV patients being treated in the developing world for the disease rely on a Mylan product.
With respect to geographic expansion, we look forward this summer to launching our commercial business in India. And initially, we'll concentrate on certain therapeutic categories, starting with our ARV portfolio. We also are pleased with progress we are making in our export markets, and we are on track this year to file 150 dossiers in countries around the globe.
Portfolio diversity continues to be an important driver of our business. Year-to-date, we've launched about 300 products, and we're on track to launch approximately 350 more by year end. As we have continued to diversify, today we offer a wide variety of dosage forms, with oral solids making up only about 57% of our portfolio. Examples of other forms include injectables, ophthalmic, patches, soft gel caps, dermatologics, respiratory and liquids.
In neurology, earlier this year, lower courts ruled against us in the U.S. and U.K., respectively on Copaxone, and we intend to appeal those decisions. We remain confident in our application and expect to receive FDA approval before we have the ability to launch our product, given the anticipated length of the appeals process.
Turning to our respiratory franchise. We continue to be on track and expect to launch generic Advair in 2015 in Europe and in 2016 in the U.S. We also continue to invest in internal respiratory capabilities in Ireland. In addition, the development of our COPD combination product remains on track.
As for biogenerics, our product development remains on track, and we look forward to commercializing affordable products globally. 
Finally, earlier this month, we applauded the signing of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA,  which received near-unanimous bipartisan support in Congress. Mylan has long been a passionate leader and an advocate for many pieces of the legislation, which updates the 1938 law governing FDA to help protect the health and safety of consumers by requiring that all facilities that supply product in the U.S., regardless of where they're located, be routinely inspected by the agency and have the one quality standard. Through the landmark Generic Drug User Fee program, the new law also will help expedite approvals of generic drugs by reducing review times of ANDA from 31 months to 10 months over the next 5 years.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss this quarter's results in more detail, and I look forward to responding to your questions."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2012, which are in line with our expectations. As you'll recall, in early May, we increased and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2012 from $2.30 to $2.50 per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. With the exception of our fully diluted share count, which I'll speak about in a few minutes, our other guidance metrics remains unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them today.
Our Q2 results reflect double-digit growth on the top line and bottom line, excluding the effects of foreign currency, and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing programs, both of which also grew by double digits.
As Heather discussed previously, our ability to continually introduce new products, in particular this quarter Doryx in the U.S., Lipitor worldwide, has served to mitigate some of the challenges of the macroeconomic environment in Europe, as well as government-mandated price reductions, which took place in Japan and Australia earlier in the year. We continue to manage against these macroeconomic headwinds and remain poised to achieve our forecasted full year result while also fully absorbing their impact.
Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 12%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to many of the other functional currencies of our major operations but mainly in Europe and India.
For the first half of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% over revenues from the first half of 2011 or 12% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this revenue range as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates is estimated to have an unfavorable impact approaching $200 million.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 second quarter was a very strong 48.5%, a 30 basis point increase over the same prior year period. This increase was driven by favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector and by new product launches, partially offset by lower margins on existing products.
The current quarter also saw margin improvement in Asia Pacific. Sales and gross profit from Mylan Laboratories Limited, our Indian subsidiary, benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee, as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 48.3% as compared to 47.7% in the prior year. Our guidance range for adjusted gross margin is 48% to 50%. We currently expect our gross margin in the second half of 2012 could potentially be above or at the upper end of our guidance range and as a result, our full year gross margin to be at the upper end of our guidance range.
Adjusted operating income was $398 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 4% increase from a very strong Q2 2011 and up 8% from the first quarter of 2012. This increase, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I just discussed, was realized in spite of R&D expense for the -- was realized in spite of increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis, was $93 million or approximately 5.5% of total revenues and up approximately 29% from the prior year and 39% on a constant currency basis. This increase was realized mainly as a result of ongoing clinical studies with respect to our respiratory and biologics programs.
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $328 million for the quarter or approximately 19.4% of total revenues, and up approximately 9% over the prior year or 13% on a constant currency basis. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased sales and marketing in our Specialty franchise, in particular for the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which has resulted in the overall growth of the anaphylaxis market.
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.3%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. We expect R&D spending to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year, primarily related to our biologic and respiratory platforms, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, was $640 million, an increase of nearly 13% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, albeit at the high end as a result of the increased sales and marketing spend.
Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million and $859 million for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year.
I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the one-off items that are being excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. In April, we entered into a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement with our production employees in Morgantown, West Virginia. In conjunction with this new agreement, we incurred approximately $15 million of cost including amounts associated with our planned withdrawal from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Second, we incurred approximately $14 million of restructuring cost principally associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Napa, California. This amount relates principally to severance and related benefits.
And finally, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $16 million, which represented an increase to our contingent consideration liability with respect to our acquisition of Pfizer's respiratory platform. Approximately half of this amount relates to the accretion of a liability to its undiscounted value, which would occur each quarter.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter of 2012 was $61 million. As of June 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. During Q2, we entered into forward starting derivative financial instruments to extend to 2016 the period over which we will maintain our 70-30 fixed floating ratio of our debt portfolio, as well as our average effective interest rate.
Adjusted interest expense for the 6-month period was $122 million, and is forecasted to be between $245 million and $265 million for the full year. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
Second quarter adjusted net income was $254 million, or $0.60 per share, a 15% increase from our Q2 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 per share. For the 6 months, adjusted net income was $478 million or $1.12 per share, a 17% increase over the same prior year period.
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for diluted EPS is now $2.45 to $2.55 per share. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million share repurchase program under which we repurchased 23.4 million shares at an average cost of $21.36 per share. The impact of this share repurchase program is included in our calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a weighted basis and now to approximately $0.01 for the current quarter. Our revised estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million shares.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release and which I discussed in detail in our first quarter earnings call, was approximately $282 million for the quarter and $349 million for the year-to-date period. In addition, the cash paid to settle previously accrued litigation, which is excluded from adjusted cash from operations, we have also excluded cash received during the quarter with respect to the settlement of a patent litigation matter.
Also during the quarter, Mylan and Sunovion settled outstanding litigation with respect to Sunovion's Xopenex product. As a result of this settlement, Mylan is licensed to continue sales of its concentrate product and will have a loyalty bearing license to sell its non-concentrate  product upon receiving final FDA approval from the U.S. FDA. The settlement also releases Mylan from payment of the $18 million in damages that has been awarded by a jury earlier this year. The net penal impact of these items, as well as a few miscellaneous other litigation matters, was an income of $12.2 million for the quarter, all of which is excluded from our adjusted earnings.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $302 million and $193 million, respectively, and leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $347 million at June 30, 2012. We are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion, driven by increased second half earnings, as well as increased cash receipts from accounts receivable related to our significant recent product launches.
Second quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date to nearly $100 million. And as a result of the timing of planned capital expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the first half of 2012 to acquire product rights and licenses.
During the current quarter, we borrowed $365 million under our revolving credit facility. This, along with cash on hand and through cash received through our -- from our accounts receivable securitization facility, was used to fund the share repurchase program, which I previously discussed. In July 2012, the size of the accounts receivable securitization facility was increased to $400 million.
Even with the additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, we continue to have a significant financial flexibility. Our leverage ratio at June 30, 2012, as a result of the additional borrowings was 3.09 to 1, which is slightly above our long-term target of 3 to 1. However, we expect to be back below 3 to 1 by December 31, 2012. As such, we will continue to revaluate the uses of free cash flow for transactions based on the parameters, which we've outlined to you in the past.
Additionally, I am pleased that in May, Mylan's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Ba1 from Ba2. And following this action, Moody's rating outlook is stable. This change is reflective of Mylan's track record of meeting our prior stated commitments, as well as our solid position within the global generic industry, in particular, our strong geographic diversification and robust product pipeline.
To summarize, our second quarter, much like our first, was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. This positions us well heading into what will be an exciting second half of the year, culminating in what should be our strongest year yet.
That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Beverly?"

Look, I think that -- I want to be careful about not talking about this quarter as a trend yet in Europe, but I will say this. We certainly are getting positive indicators. And starting with France, our, as you know, largest market, we continue to see them take initiatives, increased utilization. We see those starting to take hold. We see volumes holding. So that ability of perhaps turning the quarter, maybe throughout the rest of this year, we will see a trend. But what I can tell you, we have our arms around what we can control, our cost of goods structure, our continual repatriation and vertical integration has benefited us. And that said in the past, once that market started to turn around, we -- certainly, we get our disproportionate share because of what we've been doing during these headwinds. Italy and Spain continue to be -- show a lot of growth, especially in volume. So while there continues to be austerity measures and price impact, we see that volume in our product mix and our ability to continue to grow those markets as very promising. So I think when you look overall of where there's still see -- or where we still see opportunity as the utilization being a much better offset the cost containment than just slashing prices. And as -- when you look at some of the other European countries that are much more mature, like the U.K., there is not that opportunity for utilization. They are pretty mature markets, so thus to maintain in some of those areas is very different than some of the growth opportunities we see for our strong holders. And then let's turn to the Asia Pacific. Yes, Australia continue to see price pressure as one of the most significant to date with the 25%. I will tell you, we continuously have them since 2008 when I believe they took the first big hit on pricing to rightsize that organization to remain very nimble and agile and be able to adapt to the changing environment. We've continued to invest in our R&D and product launches and cost of goods structure, which we'll continue to do, which has helped us hold and offset that price cut. As you mentioned, Japan had a nice increase. And again, we see opportunity. We see utilization for that country at about 24%. As you know the government has talked about getting that up to at least 30% here in the very near term, so again, continuing to capture some of that growth. And as I mentioned, our world driver being our ARV franchise out of our India subsidiary. And that continues to grow nicely, and we continue to be a very competitive market leader around tenders throughout the world."

I do absolutely believe that Lidoderm could be opportunity for us in the second half of '13. And I guess just to build upon that a little bit, because I know there's been a lot of discussion around Lidoderm, just for your recollection, the citizens petition, which has been discussed quite a bit, we filed back in 2006. After that citizens petition was filed, talking about -- Indo [ph] put forward their argument about bioequivalency and how the standards should be changed and what should be required, FDA issued guidance very clearly and have said about what they wanted to see with the Lidoderm patch in the ANDA. So all of that transpired before Watson filed their ANDA in 2009, and absolutely nothing has changed from FDA's perspective on guidance or requirement since that time. So the idea that the citizens petition is holding up the application to manage, it's just not really possible. So again, we look forward to our regulatory approval and still believe that to be a very viable option in the second half of '13."

And hopefully, with people have been able to start gaining confidence in our ability to be not only laying out guidance and potential targets but our ability to meet or exceed them. So I think as we came out Investor Day with a whole assortment of opportunities that are drivers for 2013 and beyond because, as you mentioned, we need to work today on those things. So whether it's EpiPen, yes, there's a possibility there could be an AB-rated. While I remain fairly confident that, that's going to be a high hurdle, we have many, many other opportunities. I mean, when we talk about biologics, Advair, Copaxone, all definitely coming after that 2015 time period, not to mention our continuous voluminous amount of launches across the board. That's why today in my remarks, I tried to lay out not only what the platform is generating but with all the different strategic drivers that we discussed that all give benefits. So you don't have to rely on all of them hitting obviously just a couple of them hitting certainly put at great growth to Mylan from this point going forward. And I guess the other thing I'd say on your comment about integration, I could say that our Merck acquisition certainly is in a hemisphere all by itself. When you buy a company 2.5x your size and do a transformational acquisition as we did, certainly that integration, I think took a couple of 3 years that we certainly were able and continue to show every step along the way our ability to realize those synergies. I think when you look at acquisitions outside of that, we've certainly stated we're not doing a large 2.5x our size transformative acquisition. So things like Bioniche respiratory franchise from Pfizer, we've continued to be able to bolt and tuck those in without ever even mentioning integration or missing a beat because I think the platform we have in place today is scalable and sustainable and is able to absorb these kind of acquisitions very, very easily. So there's not a long-term planning period for any of those."

We don't speak specifically before launches in Europe as you know. There's some competitive advantage, and it's not the same system that gives the same visibility, like here in the United States with Paragraph IV. But I can tell you, we've had very successful launches already this year, as I spoke about Atorvastatin and Candesartan and then Ibandronate. And like I said, we continue to have many more. Our total R&D portfolio and filings, we look to be doubling our size by 2015. So I mean, that should give you a sense of the amount of products that we have in the pipeline or already filed with regulatory agencies around the world of what we're going to be launching over the next couple of years. As far as Paragraph IV goes, I mean, certainly, we have been showing, like we did back in Investor Day, the state certain launches that we already know of or our first-to-file, share to file opportunities, 2012 was one of our largest years as far as the states certain so far been, but we continue to already be -- have settlements that go out through '13, '14, '15 of date certain. We continue to get our share of first-to-file opportunities. So I would just say that we continue to maximize and leverage our platform on all of the fronts that we have in the past. Difficult-to-formulate products, the Paragraph IV opportunity and, like I said, just a voluminous amount of dosage forms. And we are investing in everything from injectables, as I mentioned earlier, to our patches, at oral, solid dose soft gels, dermatologicals. So as far as from an M&A, when you think about -- we really have a lot of opportunity to complement this platform across the globe, from our Specialty division to continue to complement our infrastructure and disease state expertise in respiratory and allergy. You look at our Biologics partnerships and our ability to continue to leverage and build upon that, as well as therapeutic categories that we're not in yet. So we see an opportunity to still bid our U.S. generics business with things like whether it would be antibiotics or dermatological things that we're not as large in today. So across the board, I would say, we have many opportunities to continue to fuel the engine that we've put together across all of the fronts I just mentioned."

I would also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of",1590,"Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to congratulate them on a job well done.
Mylan had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit top line and bottom line year-over-year growth. Sales were about $1.7 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis, and our adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% from the same prior year quarter to $0.60 a share. Building on our strong first quarter, this stellar performance supports our confidence that 2012 will be the best year-to-date in Mylan's history, with many more to come.
Among the second quarter's highlights were growth of more than 50% in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our ARV franchise. Our performance this quarter was strong compared to last year's second quarter when we had several very significant product launches. Further, we delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform through increased R&D and sales and marketing programs. In addition, our gross margin was up almost half a percentage point.
We also saw improvement in some European countries. Constant currency third-party net sales in our EMEA region were down about 3% year-over-year, a smaller decline than we've seen in recent quarters. EMEA's top line was essentially flat from Q1 to Q2 of this year. These results are yet another demonstration of our ability to manage our global platform for growth by optimizing new launches and seizing opportunities as we continue to build our base business and effectively manage pricing pressures. It's against this factor of that we look forward to the third quarter, which we project to be by far our strongest of the year, and a fourth quarter that is similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. We are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our 2013 target of $2.75.
Earlier this year, when we hosted our Investor Day, we outlined Mylan's strategic growth drivers. I'd like to walk you through several of them now and comment on results achieved or progress made during the second quarter. Our core growth driver is our global operating platform, which we continue to leverage this quarter. In our North America generics business, third-party net sales for the quarter were $845 million, up 13% from the comparable year ago period. More than 70% of these sales come from existing products, with the remainder coming from multiple new launches.
In the U.S., drivers in the quarter included Escitalopram, Doryx and Abacavir, which is enjoying 180 days of exclusivity. We also look forward to important launches throughout the rest of the year, including Modafinil. For our settlement with Teva, we may launch our product on August 10, which is prior to the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period brand of Teva. We also expect to launch Actos, Actoplus Met and [indiscernible].
In Canada, our robust pipeline has produced 17 new product launches thus far in 2012, an unprecedented number for us, and we expect to sustain a similar level annually through at least 2015. Among our more significant second quarter launches were Crestor and
Tracleer.
In EMEA, constant currency third-party net sales for the quarter totaled $327 million which, as I mentioned earlier, represented a decline of about 3% year-over-year. Nearly 90% of these outcomes from existing products, with the remainder coming from new product introductions throughout the region which included Lipitor, Candesartan, Ibandronate, Lamivudine, which is our first generic ARV launched in Europe.
While existing product volume remained flat year-over-year, pricing was as expected, lower due to government action and ongoing competitive pressure. In this environment, we continue to manage our cost structure aggressively through vertical integration, repatriation of product and other measures taken to manage and reduce cost of goods sold.
In both Italy and Spain, we experienced double-digit constant currency sales growth year-over-year due to higher volumes on existing products and new product launches, which offset pricing impact. In addition to Italy and Spain, we saw some growth in smaller countries. And in Germany, our enhanced cost structure continue to allow us to compete in multiple tenders.
In our Asia-Pacific region, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled nearly $308 million and 9% constant currency increase. The primary driver of this growth was our ARV franchise. In Japan, higher volumes continue to offset price cuts that went into effect on April 1, and of which the market began adjusting during the first quarter.
Our third-party sales in Australia fell slightly as new product revenue and favorable volume and mix nearly offset the impact of price cuts of nearly 25% made in the second quarter by Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and most significant agency's history [ph].
As for our Specialty business, our second quarter performance was very strong. Sales rose 51% year-over-year to almost $200 million. Year-over-year sales for the first half of 2012 were up 58%.
Domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector accounted for most of this increase, driven by unprecedented script to expansion and ongoing growth of the anaphylaxis marketplace. Performance sales also grew, and the product continues to do well in all 4 major channels: retail, home health care, hospitals and long-term care. The nebulized LABA market in the U.S. is expected to expand about 15% this year and 10% in 2013. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the market. We also were pleased to announce in May that we had entered into settlement agreements with Sanofi and concerning their Brovana products.
Moving on to our other strategic growth drivers, we continue to believe we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing measures being taken to boost generic utilization. In the last year, utilization has increased in several European countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, as governments modify reimbursement practices. Recently in France, for instance, when a consumer wants to buy a certain brand of product, he must pay for them out of pocket and then get reimbursed, whereas if he's willing to accept the generic alternative, he will pay nothing.
In addition, Japan continues to represent a significant opportunity. Over the last 12 months, Japan has experienced growth in generic utilization, which now stands at about 24%.
As for our global Institutional business, we continue to invest in research and development and an additional capacity, which will allow us to increase the vertical integration of this business and support the future double-digit sales growth we expect. In addition, year-to-date in the U.S., we have received approvals on 5 injectable products, and we launched several products throughout the rest of the world.
Moving on to our ARV franchise. We continue to strengthen our position as the market leader with our new and innovative dosage forms, and our portfolio now contains 43 products. Currently, approximately 1/3 of all HIV patients being treated in the developing world for the disease rely on a Mylan product.
With respect to geographic expansion, we look forward this summer to launching our commercial business in India. And initially, we'll concentrate on certain therapeutic categories, starting with our ARV portfolio. We also are pleased with progress we are making in our export markets, and we are on track this year to file 150 dossiers in countries around the globe.
Portfolio diversity continues to be an important driver of our business. Year-to-date, we've launched about 300 products, and we're on track to launch approximately 350 more by year end. As we have continued to diversify, today we offer a wide variety of dosage forms, with oral solids making up only about 57% of our portfolio. Examples of other forms include injectables, ophthalmic, patches, soft gel caps, dermatologics, respiratory and liquids.
In neurology, earlier this year, lower courts ruled against us in the U.S. and U.K., respectively on Copaxone, and we intend to appeal those decisions. We remain confident in our application and expect to receive FDA approval before we have the ability to launch our product, given the anticipated length of the appeals process.
Turning to our respiratory franchise. We continue to be on track and expect to launch generic Advair in 2015 in Europe and in 2016 in the U.S. We also continue to invest in internal respiratory capabilities in Ireland. In addition, the development of our COPD combination product remains on track.
As for biogenerics, our product development remains on track, and we look forward to commercializing affordable products globally. 
Finally, earlier this month, we applauded the signing of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA,  which received near-unanimous bipartisan support in Congress. Mylan has long been a passionate leader and an advocate for many pieces of the legislation, which updates the 1938 law governing FDA to help protect the health and safety of consumers by requiring that all facilities that supply product in the U.S., regardless of where they're located, be routinely inspected by the agency and have the one quality standard. Through the landmark Generic Drug User Fee program, the new law also will help expedite approvals of generic drugs by reducing review times of ANDA from 31 months to 10 months over the next 5 years.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss this quarter's results in more detail, and I look forward to responding to your questions."
290203,213782906,332753,"Mylan, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today'",2098,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
I am pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2012, which are in line with our expectations. As you'll recall, in early May, we increased and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2012 from $2.30 to $2.50 per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. With the exception of our fully diluted share count, which I'll speak about in a few minutes, our other guidance metrics remains unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them today.
Our Q2 results reflect double-digit growth on the top line and bottom line, excluding the effects of foreign currency, and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing programs, both of which also grew by double digits.
As Heather discussed previously, our ability to continually introduce new products, in particular this quarter Doryx in the U.S., Lipitor worldwide, has served to mitigate some of the challenges of the macroeconomic environment in Europe, as well as government-mandated price reductions, which took place in Japan and Australia earlier in the year. We continue to manage against these macroeconomic headwinds and remain poised to achieve our forecasted full year result while also fully absorbing their impact.
Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 12%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to many of the other functional currencies of our major operations but mainly in Europe and India.
For the first half of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% over revenues from the first half of 2011 or 12% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.
Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this revenue range as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates is estimated to have an unfavorable impact approaching $200 million.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 second quarter was a very strong 48.5%, a 30 basis point increase over the same prior year period. This increase was driven by favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector and by new product launches, partially offset by lower margins on existing products.
The current quarter also saw margin improvement in Asia Pacific. Sales and gross profit from Mylan Laboratories Limited, our Indian subsidiary, benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee, as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 48.3% as compared to 47.7% in the prior year. Our guidance range for adjusted gross margin is 48% to 50%. We currently expect our gross margin in the second half of 2012 could potentially be above or at the upper end of our guidance range and as a result, our full year gross margin to be at the upper end of our guidance range.
Adjusted operating income was $398 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 4% increase from a very strong Q2 2011 and up 8% from the first quarter of 2012. This increase, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I just discussed, was realized in spite of R&D expense for the -- was realized in spite of increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.
R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis, was $93 million or approximately 5.5% of total revenues and up approximately 29% from the prior year and 39% on a constant currency basis. This increase was realized mainly as a result of ongoing clinical studies with respect to our respiratory and biologics programs.
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $328 million for the quarter or approximately 19.4% of total revenues, and up approximately 9% over the prior year or 13% on a constant currency basis. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased sales and marketing in our Specialty franchise, in particular for the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which has resulted in the overall growth of the anaphylaxis market.
For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.3%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. We expect R&D spending to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year, primarily related to our biologic and respiratory platforms, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.
SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, was $640 million, an increase of nearly 13% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, albeit at the high end as a result of the increased sales and marketing spend.
Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million and $859 million for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year.
I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the one-off items that are being excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. In April, we entered into a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement with our production employees in Morgantown, West Virginia. In conjunction with this new agreement, we incurred approximately $15 million of cost including amounts associated with our planned withdrawal from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Second, we incurred approximately $14 million of restructuring cost principally associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Napa, California. This amount relates principally to severance and related benefits.
And finally, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $16 million, which represented an increase to our contingent consideration liability with respect to our acquisition of Pfizer's respiratory platform. Approximately half of this amount relates to the accretion of a liability to its undiscounted value, which would occur each quarter.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter of 2012 was $61 million. As of June 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. During Q2, we entered into forward starting derivative financial instruments to extend to 2016 the period over which we will maintain our 70-30 fixed floating ratio of our debt portfolio, as well as our average effective interest rate.
Adjusted interest expense for the 6-month period was $122 million, and is forecasted to be between $245 million and $265 million for the full year. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.
Second quarter adjusted net income was $254 million, or $0.60 per share, a 15% increase from our Q2 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 per share. For the 6 months, adjusted net income was $478 million or $1.12 per share, a 17% increase over the same prior year period.
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for diluted EPS is now $2.45 to $2.55 per share. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million share repurchase program under which we repurchased 23.4 million shares at an average cost of $21.36 per share. The impact of this share repurchase program is included in our calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a weighted basis and now to approximately $0.01 for the current quarter. Our revised estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million shares.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release and which I discussed in detail in our first quarter earnings call, was approximately $282 million for the quarter and $349 million for the year-to-date period. In addition, the cash paid to settle previously accrued litigation, which is excluded from adjusted cash from operations, we have also excluded cash received during the quarter with respect to the settlement of a patent litigation matter.
Also during the quarter, Mylan and Sunovion settled outstanding litigation with respect to Sunovion's Xopenex product. As a result of this settlement, Mylan is licensed to continue sales of its concentrate product and will have a loyalty bearing license to sell its non-concentrate  product upon receiving final FDA approval from the U.S. FDA. The settlement also releases Mylan from payment of the $18 million in damages that has been awarded by a jury earlier this year. The net penal impact of these items, as well as a few miscellaneous other litigation matters, was an income of $12.2 million for the quarter, all of which is excluded from our adjusted earnings.
Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $302 million and $193 million, respectively, and leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $347 million at June 30, 2012. We are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion, driven by increased second half earnings, as well as increased cash receipts from accounts receivable related to our significant recent product launches.
Second quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date to nearly $100 million. And as a result of the timing of planned capital expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the first half of 2012 to acquire product rights and licenses.
During the current quarter, we borrowed $365 million under our revolving credit facility. This, along with cash on hand and through cash received through our -- from our accounts receivable securitization facility, was used to fund the share repurchase program, which I previously discussed. In July 2012, the size of the accounts receivable securitization facility was increased to $400 million.
Even with the additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, we continue to have a significant financial flexibility. Our leverage ratio at June 30, 2012, as a result of the additional borrowings was 3.09 to 1, which is slightly above our long-term target of 3 to 1. However, we expect to be back below 3 to 1 by December 31, 2012. As such, we will continue to revaluate the uses of free cash flow for transactions based on the parameters, which we've outlined to you in the past.
Additionally, I am pleased that in May, Mylan's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Ba1 from Ba2. And following this action, Moody's rating outlook is stable. This change is reflective of Mylan's track record of meeting our prior stated commitments, as well as our solid position within the global generic industry, in particular, our strong geographic diversification and robust product pipeline.
To summarize, our second quarter, much like our first, was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. This positions us well heading into what will be an exciting second half of the year, culminating in what should be our strongest year yet.
That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Beverly?"

Look, I think that -- I want to be careful about not talking about this quarter as a trend yet in Europe, but I will say this. We certainly are getting positive indicators. And starting with France, our, as you know, largest market, we continue to see them take initiatives, increased utilization. We see those starting to take hold. We see volumes holding. So that ability of perhaps turning the quarter, maybe throughout the rest of this year, we will see a trend. But what I can tell you, we have our arms around what we can control, our cost of goods structure, our continual repatriation and vertical integration has benefited us. And that said in the past, once that market started to turn around, we -- certainly, we get our disproportionate share because of what we've been doing during these headwinds. Italy and Spain continue to be -- show a lot of growth, especially in volume. So while there continues to be austerity measures and price impact, we see that volume in our product mix and our ability to continue to grow those markets as very promising. So I think when you look overall of where there's still see -- or where we still see opportunity as the utilization being a much better offset the cost containment than just slashing prices. And as -- when you look at some of the other European countries that are much more mature, like the U.K., there is not that opportunity for utilization. They are pretty mature markets, so thus to maintain in some of those areas is very different than some of the growth opportunities we see for our strong holders. And then let's turn to the Asia Pacific. Yes, Australia continue to see price pressure as one of the most significant to date with the 25%. I will tell you, we continuously have them since 2008 when I believe they took the first big hit on pricing to rightsize that organization to remain very nimble and agile and be able to adapt to the changing environment. We've continued to invest in our R&D and product launches and cost of goods structure, which we'll continue to do, which has helped us hold and offset that price cut. As you mentioned, Japan had a nice increase. And again, we see opportunity. We see utilization for that country at about 24%. As you know the government has talked about getting that up to at least 30% here in the very near term, so again, continuing to capture some of that growth. And as I mentioned, our world driver being our ARV franchise out of our India subsidiary. And that continues to grow nicely, and we continue to be a very competitive market leader around tenders throughout the world."

We've stated that we always believe that those weren't sustainable business model, that our ability to continue to leverage our global platform very much made us unique throughout the European countries. And so our ability to weather the storm that Europe's been going through, and come out on the other side stronger with a much better cost of goods structure, put us in position to compete much better than any regional or local player that doesn't have the benefit of the global scale that the Mylan platform have.

Certainly, the Specialty business, including EpiPen, has its strongest quarter of the year in the third quarter, and that it will benefit us. We also have a very strong year for launches in North America, and new product launches, obviously, are beneficial. But aside from North America, as we talked about in the first quarter, we have been seeing through the cost-reduction efforts that we've been taking, whether it be the vertical integration, the repatriation efforts, we have been able to maintain and grow margins in Europe, and we've been able to also -- even with the price cuts that we've seen in Asian countries, been able to weather that with stable margins.

So I think as we came out Investor Day with a whole assortment of opportunities that are drivers for 2013 and beyond because, as you mentioned, we need to work today on those things. So whether it's EpiPen, yes, there's a possibility there could be an AB-rated. While I remain fairly confident that, that's going to be a high hurdle, we have many, many other opportunities. I mean, when we talk about biologics, Advair, Copaxone, all definitely coming after that 2015 time period, not to mention our continuous voluminous amount of launches across the board. That's why today in my remarks, I tried to lay out not only what the platform is generating but with all the different strategic drivers that we discussed that all give benefits. So you don't have to rely on all of them hitting obviously just a couple of them hitting certainly put at great growth to Mylan from this point going forward. And I guess the other thing I'd say on your comment about integration, I could say that our Merck acquisition certainly is in a hemisphere all by itself. When you buy a company 2.5x your size and do a transformational acquisition as we did, certainly that integration, I think took a couple of 3 years that we certainly were able and continue to show every step along the way our ability to realize those synergies. I think when you look at acquisitions outside of that, we've certainly stated we're not doing a large 2.5x our size transformative acquisition. So things like Bioniche respiratory franchise from Pfizer, we've continued to be able to bolt and tuck those in without ever even mentioning integration or missing a beat because I think the platform we have in place today is scalable and sustainable and is able to absorb these kind of acquisitions very, very easily.

But I can tell you, we've had very successful launches already this year, as I spoke about Atorvastatin and Candesartan and then Ibandronate. And like I said, we continue to have many more. Our total R&D portfolio and filings, we look to be doubling our size by 2015. So I mean, that should give you a sense of the amount of products that we have in the pipeline or already filed with regulatory agencies around the world of what we're going to be launching over the next couple of years. As far as Paragraph IV goes, I mean, certainly, we have been showing, like we did back in Investor Day, the state certain launches that we already know of or our first-to-file, share to file opportunities, 2012 was one of our largest years as far as the states certain so far been, but we continue to already be -- have settlements that go out through '13, '14, '15 of date certain.

So as far as from an M&A, when you think about -- we really have a lot of opportunity to complement this platform across the globe, from our Specialty division to continue to complement our infrastructure and disease state expertise in respiratory and allergy. You look at our Biologics partnerships and our ability to continue to leverage and build upon that, as well as therapeutic categories that we're not in yet. So we see an opportunity to still bid our U.S. generics business with things like whether it would be antibiotics or dermatological things that we're not as large in today. So across the board, I would say, we have many opportunities to continue to fuel the engine that we've put together across all of the fronts I just mentioned."

I think that was a contributor to some of the strengths. But I would say, I also put a lot more weight on, like I said, just a pure expansion in education that's taken place in the market.

I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on the top and bottom line. Our third quarter",1569,"Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on the top and bottom line. 
Our third quarter constant currency revenues were at 20% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.83. I'd like to note that we did more this quarter than we did in all of 2008 with essentially the same assets. This only further highlights the power of our organic growth capabilities. of course, these milestones could only have been achieved through the hardware, dedication and commitment of all of our employees. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank all of them.
Now with 3 very successful quarters behind us this year, we are raising our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. We also are reaffirming our 2013 target of $2.75 per share and our longer-term target of at least $6 per share in 2018. We expect to provide detailed guidance for 2013 in February when we release our fourth quarter and year-end results. We will discuss our longer-term outlook in July during our investor day event, which we will host in New York. 
Our ability to deliver a consistently strong results takes advantage of our opportunities and become ever more efficient, all while mitigating risk and absorbing economic headwinds and price cuts give Mylan a unique profile in this industry. With that said, our expectation of continued growth will come from a combination of things. First, from the continued organic growth of our very strong and powerful existing platform. Second, from against the strategic growth drivers we outlined during our Investor Day. And third, and importantly, from our ability to continue generating significant free cash flow, which allowed us to accelerate our deleveraging and get to a current 2.6:1 debt-to-EBITDA, well below our target. Therefore, we are actively looking at a number of ways to use our increasing financial flexibility to help us accelerate our longer-term target and enhance shareholder value.
Against this backdrop, I'd like to walk you now through Mylan's outstanding third quarter performance, which was characterized by strong double-digit revenue growth in our Specialty, North America and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in Europe. In addition, our gross margin increased nearly 400 basis points year-over-year to 52%.
Starting with North America generics business, we reported third party net revenues of $831 million, a year-over-year increase of 19% at constant currency. Driving the increase where new product launches during the quarter, which contributed to the $258 million and included Valsartan HCT in September with 180 days of exclusively, Modafinil in August and pioglitazone and pioglitazone metformin also in August in bodes 180 days of exclusively. The largest offset lower pricing and volume on existing products. 
As of the end of the third quarter, we had introduced 47 new products this year in the U.S. including 17 that were first-to-file or limited competition. In Canada, as of the end of the third quarter, we had launched a record 22 new products, revenues from which contributed to favorable year-over-year sales growth in that market. 
In addition, revenues from our Institutional business grew by nearly 25% on a constant currency basis during the quarter, with new products and higher volumes responsible for most of the growth. 
In Europe, we reported third party net revenues of $326 million, a year-over-year increase of 6% at constant currency. Many of our European markets realized increased sales, an encouraging sign that the region may finally be turning order. 
In addition, I'd note that as of the second quarter, the latest period for which data are available, generic utilization has risen year-over-year in the 19 European countries where we do business. 
As of the end of the third quarter, Mylan executed 270 country launches in Europe during the year. These launches, along with favorable volumes on existing products, where the primary drivers of our improved performance during the third quarter. The higher product volume included double-digit growth in France, Italy and Spain, which offset some lower pricing resulting from government mandates and competitive conditions. 
France saw the most significant revenue increase in absolute terms, as local currency sales rose 9% compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, to new product launches revenues benefited from the recently signed pharmaceutical convention, which contributed to a 7% point increase in substitution among repertoire listed products from May to August. We also are seeing growth in the French generic market overall in volume and value, and we remain in the market leader. 
We observed similar trends in Italy where new products and higher volumes more than offset the impact of government-mandated price reduction. I'd also note that Italy's government has passed a law requiring general practitioners to prescribe products for patients starting new treatments for chronic and acute conditions. Italy is one of the fastest-growing generic markets in Europe, and we are the country's fastest-growing major player.
In Asia-Pacific, we recorded a third party net revenues of $339 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 21%. Our Mylan Lab subsidiary in India, along with Japan and New Zealand, all experienced higher third-party sales. India accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant sales both ARVs and significant growth in API. 
In Australia, where we continue to maintain our leadership position, sales were lower operationally due mainly to steep price cuts made by the government during the year. 
Sales in Japan rose had higher volumes mainly in the distributor channel and new product launches offset NIH pricing cuts that set the factor during the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see increased generic utilization. 
Also during the third quarter, we announced an exclusive long-term strategic collaboration with Pfizer to drive sustained growth for our combined Generics business in Japan. This unique partnership, unprecedented in our industry, leverages the core strength of both organizations and creates a powerful platform that we expect will be a leader in Japan in terms of scale, scope and quality. 
Our Specialty segment, we reported third party net revenues of $294 million, a year-over-year increase of 37%. Sales of EpiPen in the U.S. accounted for most of the increase, with the growth of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2011. Our third quarter is essentially the strongest for sales of this product, and our growth this quarter came off a very strong quarter last year. 
I'd also note that we continue to see our efforts around market expansion pay off to the first 9 months of 2012. The percentage of at-risk individuals in the U.S. who have build a prescription for EpiPen Auto-Injector has risen from 7% to 10%. More importantly, the growth potential for this franchise remains significant.
As I move on now to some of our other drivers of growth through 2018, I'd like to reinforce that each driver and our broad baskets of opportunity is weighted based on it its unique risk reward profile and projected long-term contribution. Our success and our ability to achieve our targets doesn't depend on any 1 driver, and instead, our success is based on the global scale and leverage we have created and our ability to invest and execute on these opportunities. 
With respect to our global Institutional business, we continue to grow and expand our relationships with key customers and invest in the future of this franchise. A few weeks ago, we agreed to purchase an oncology manufacturing facility in India from SMS Pharmaceutical. That facility will produce active pharmaceuticals in finished dosage forms and begin commercial operation as soon as the FDA completes its inspection, which is expected to occur in the next few months. The transaction should close early in the first quarter of 2013.
With respect to geographic expansion, we launched commercial operations in India in August, entering the market with a comprehensive portfolio of ARV products for the treatment of HIV AIDS. We also were selected as a leading supplier of ARV drugs to India's National AIDS Control Organization. 
I'd note that both of these developments also support our ARV growth driver. And in addition, to our expansion in India, we are poised to establish a physical presence shortly in Thailand. 
Portfolio diversity is another important growth driver and we remain excited about the Women's Health Care franchise we are establishing in partnership with Sam Care. During the third quarter we launched 2 oral contraceptives in Germany. We also launched one this week in Canada. And in addition, we have 34 oral contraceptives pending approval with the FDA and expect commercialization to begin in next year's first quarter.
With respect to our Biologics driver, we have continued to advance the development of our 5 lead products. We have held positive meetings with the authorities in the U.S. and Europe to discuss our Biologics program. In addition, we are pleased to report that we initiated our first global Phase III clinical trial on in October. 
Clearly, Mylan continues to operate and grow from a position of great strength and we look forward to leveraging that strength further to deliver even more value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John, and I look forward to responding to your questions."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comment at the beginning of today's",1915,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
Let me start by saying, by any measure, the third quarter of 2012 was an exceptional quarter for Mylan. I would like to highlight upfront some of our financial accomplishments. Quarterly revenue of $1.8 billion, the highest amount of revenue in any quarter in our company's history, and revenue grew on a constant currency basis in every region of the world including Europe. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83, more than we earned in all of 2008, and were achieved while continue to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives. 
Adjusted operating cash flow of $469 million, the most ever for our company in one quarter, and free cash flow of $424 million, which allowed us to repay borrowings during the quarter of $459 million. And to the end of the quarter, and to end the quarter with a growth leverage ratio of 2.7:1, or 2.6:1 when you consider an additional $100 million of borrowings, which we repaid in early October.
On the heels of this strong quarter, we are once again increasing our range of EPS guidance for the full year 2012. We're now projecting adjusted diluted EPS of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, increased from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. We are also revising upward our free cash flow expectations for 2012. We now expect adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2012, which is at the very upper end of our 2012 operating cash flow guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion. 
Additionally, as a result of the timing and rationalization of some of our capital programs, our gross capital spending in 2012 is now anticipated to approximate $300 million. The net of these 2 amounts represent our current 2012 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million or $100 million higher than the midpoint of our previously communicated expectation.
Our remaining guidance metrics for 2012 remain unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them in a few minutes, and our targets for the 2013 and beyond remain unchanged.
In February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2013 financial guidance, which reflects recent developments at our most up-to-date outlook.
So, Mylan has never been better positioned as a company. Today, we possess an unmatched vertically integrated footprint, a broad and growing product portfolio with a robust pipeline of future new product launches and longer-term strategic growth drivers such as our respiratory and Biologics platform. 
Additionally though, Mylan possesses today the financial flexibility to take advantage of shareholder value accretion opportunity. With our current leverage ratio, now meaningfully below our long-term target of 3:1 and our growing EBITDA, today, we have over $4 billion of financial flexibility for earnings accretive transaction. That said, Mylan will do never do a transaction merely for the sake of the transaction or only for financial reasons. Andy transaction must also be the right transaction strategically. Further, we remain committed to our 3:1 long-term growth leverage target. And if we increase our target above this target, we will be committed to deleveraging within an 18-month timeframe.
With that introduction, let me now get into the detailed details and walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 14% over last year's third quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 19%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to each of the other functional currencies of our major operations mainly in Europe and India.
Our top line growth was driven by higher volume on a consolidated basis, including significant amount from our 2012 new product launches, as well as favorable sales volume in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which served to more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower pricing throughout the world. In fact, driven by higher volumes and new product introductions, each of the countries in Europe in which we have significant operations, with the exception of Germany, turned in favorable year-over-year constant currency sales growth. 
For the first 9 months of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of 10% over revenues from the first 9 months of 2011, or 14% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year of 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion. Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this guidance range as a result of the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, however, we are projecting to be closer to the midpoint of the range.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 third quarter at 52% was above our guidance range of 48% to 50% and represented an increase over the same prior year period of nearly 400 basis points. This increase was driven by new product launches and favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by lower margins on existing products. The current quarter also saw margin improvement from our Indian subsidiary, where sales and gross profit benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of its sale are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 50% as compared to 48% in the prior year. We currently expect to be at the upper end of our gross margin guidance range for the full year.
Adjusted operating income was $513 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 32% increase from Q3 2011 and up 29% from the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increases, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit, was realized in spite of increased levels of investment in both R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis, was $104 million or approximately 5.8% of total revenues and up approximately 51% from the prior year. This increase was mainly a result of ongoing spending with respect to our respiratory and Biologics program, including clinical studies. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $324 million for the quarter or approximately 18% of total revenues and up approximately 5% over the prior year. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased selling and marketing in our Specialty franchise. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher payroll and related cost as we continue to build out our infrastructure platform in certain targeted areas.
For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $277 million, up 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.5%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be at or slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.
SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, was $964 million, an increase of nearly 10% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was $567 million and $1.4 billion for the 3- and 9-month period ended September 30, 2012 period, respectively. We expect to be near the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $1.75 -- or $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion for the full year.
Moving onto our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fix floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $183 million and is forecast to be at the low end of the guidance range of $245 million to $265 million for the full year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that we will be at the lower end of this range for the calendar year 2012.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $341 million or $0.83 a share, a 51% increase from our Q3 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55 per share. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $820 million or $1.94 per share, a 28% increase over the same prior year period. 
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS is now $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Our estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release, was approximately $818 million for the year-to-date period and a very strong hundred $469 million for the quarter. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $460 million and $652 million, respectively and left us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling $366 million. As noted earlier, we were forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion, the high end of our guidance range.
We have been very focused throughout 2012 on operating working capital. On constant currency, net sales growth of 19% in the third quarter and 14% through the first 9 months of 2012, we have been able to limit the growth in our operating working capital to approximately 9%, exclusive of FX impact, as we continue to bring operational efficiencies to our global platform.
Third quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date period to nearly $160 million. And as a result of the timing of planned expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.
As mentioned before, these updated estimates yield a current free cash flow estimate of $700 million for the year, which is $100 million stronger than our previously communicated expectation as we continue to generate an increasing amount of cash flows from our global platform.
To summarize, our third quarter exceeded even our high expectations, and as anticipated, positions us to a very strong finish for 2012. Our strong track record for organic growth, coupled with a long-term growth drivers, which Heather discussed, and our significant financial flexibility, all translate into what should be an exciting 2013 and beyond for Mylan. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Maria?"

And second, Europe, obviously, great news there, can you talk about profitability and how that has changed throughout the year and what you're doing there to increase profitability? And then third, can you just talk about the about the Institutional business a little bit more? how many new products should we be expecting to launch out of that and helping the business how big a business are you looking to build there?"

Marc, I'll start with a U.S. So, I guess I'd like to first start by saying against our estimates, our U.S. business performed right in line with where we thought it would be. While we absolutely had a significant amount of launches that we forecasted and projected at the beginning of the year, that '12 would be a great year for our U.S. Generics business, I think that if you look at the timing of the launches throughout the quarter, and some of that pull through even from launches we had earlier in the year, so all I can tell you is that absolutely performed in line with where we thought it would. We think it's still showing strength in the base business as well as our continued launches that we have for the remainder of the year. So from our perspective, U.S. business, hitting on all cylinders. Europe profitability, I think as we have talked about in the past that we constantly grew this entire macroeconomic situation throughout Europe has balanced our top and bottom line growth. You heard me quarter after quarter coming in and say we weren't going to chase the bottom, that there's been irrational behavior and that we would continue to hold steady and control what we can control. So in the spirit of time, we've done just that. We continued to increase the profitability around our cost of goods by continuing to vertically integrate and be 100% responsible for our global supply chain. We've continued to make sure that we're structured in the right way with some of the evolving businesses and as they are continuing to change in the different countries. And I think most importantly, and why I wanted to point out in my script, that in all of the countries we're doing business, we see an increase in generic conversion. And I think that should be the brightest spot of all because what it shows is that governments very much are beginning to recognize the long-term sustainability that generic utilization brings versus a onetime price cut. So we've seen additional initiatives in Italy. We've seen additional initiatives in France that are bringing us back up. So from my perspective, we certainly have always maintained the need to balance profitable and revenue I think that our results this quarter are paying off from how we're operating our business in Europe. And lastly, on the Institutional side, in February, we showed our Institutional business being an important strategic growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in that business, we have numerous launches, we're continuing to very much accelerate our own internal R&D pipeline around this businesses globally. So all I can say is that we certainly are continuing to invest and continue to see this as a very important driver for us in the future."

So, look, to your first question, hopefully you'll see that as our continued commitment to be transparent. When I -- what I spoke of in my opening remarks was a combination, if you'll remember, of us continuing to execute in our existing platform, continuing to execute against the growth drivers we pointed out. And then obviously, the last point was to looking at ways that we're going to use our increased financial flexibility. And I think, as you have seen, that has been a combination and I think it will continue to be. There's a lot of ways to increase shareholder value and I think what you can rely on is that we're looking at all of them. And we certainly are looking at any and all compelling acquisition that would allow us to continue to deliver or accelerate the that we're already on. And when look at what we have put out there with our own assets at this time, a 15% CAGR in 2018 is an impressive growth target out there. And I think that as this financial flexibility just gives us all that much more ability to accelerate not only that growth, but like I said, in many different ways. As far as Japan goes, I think it's an unprecedented deal in our industry. I think it truly does take the core competencies of both of our organizations and we believe that 1 plus 1 will equal 3 plus. It's about really leveraging the scale and scope and the quality of what we both bring to the table. So while we don't get into putting numbers out there on individual countries, I think you certainly can expect that we believe that this is accretive to our current standalone Generics business, as well as accretive to their standalone Generics business. And that's why the rationale of this deal made all the sense in the world. And I very much believe that it could be a model in other countries where the troops on the ground are important, the brand is important, but having the breadth and the quality of a pipeline is equally as important. And that's where this makes all the sense in the world and very much could make sense in other countries as we move forward. Okay, operator, next question?"

So like I said, you're right, we're not just looking at a transaction for transaction's sake, but we certainly are in a position to be looking at all the compelling ones.

So that's kind of -- as far as I'm willing to go with my crystal ball, but I can tell you we're excited about the direction Europe's moving and see that continuing. As far as trend, look, I think that it's very important to understand that this is a one-off issue and it really does not speak to the generic industry. I will say it speaks to the pharmaceutical industry overall as you know from time to time as FDA continues to gather data and look at data. There's times where they've taken brand products off the market as well as changing guidelines and changing specs. So this is something that's constantly going on within the FDA in looking and working with companies. I think in this particular instance, it was certainly related to patient safety. FDA made a judgment call our years ago around the 300 milligrams and with the data today that they're looking at has caused them to get to a different place. Certainly, we don't see those events impacting our product and believe this was certainly in relation to just one in particular formulation.

I think to talk about what kind of science is out there and who has the capability, I can assure you, we are manufacturing and developing our own products and I believe we do have the expertise and the track record with FDA to know and to be able to guide of what we're capable of doing. So that's what I would say about and goats comic and the absolute and so we continue to see this as a possible opportunity in the second half of the year.

Our forward-looking statements may today, including, among others, statements relating to anticipated business levels; trends in some European countries; planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity period for new products; our ability to achieve forecasted full year results while absorbing the impact of negative pricing pressures; expectations for capital expenditures; expectations for R&D, SG&A and other spending; our guidance range, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth and other expectations; and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the fourth quarter and for 2012 overall. Because these statements are forward looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties, and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under Forward-looking Statements in our recent earnings press release dated October 25, 2012, as well as the risk factors set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, and our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, including our earnings press release, which we filed on Form 8-K, through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so.
In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted revenue, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS, should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.

290203,222537176,370276,"Mylan, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. Our third q",1569,"Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. 
Our third quarter constant currency revenues were up 20% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.83. I'd like to note that we did more this quarter than we did in all of 2008 with essentially the same assets. This only further highlights the power of our organic growth capabilities. Of course, these milestones could only have been achieved through the hard work, dedication and commitment of all of our employees. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank all of them.
Now with 3 very successful quarters behind us this year, we are raising our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. We also are reaffirming our 2013 target of $2.75 per share and our longer-term target of at least $6 per share in 2018. We expect to provide detailed guidance for 2013 in February when we release our fourth quarter and year-end results. We will discuss our longer-term outlook in July during our Investor Day event, which we will host in New York. 
Our ability to deliver consistently strong results, take swift advantage of our opportunities and become ever more efficient, all while mitigating risk and absorbing economic headwinds and price cuts, give Mylan a unique profile in this industry. With that said, our expectation of continued growth will come from a combination of things: first, from the continued organic growth of our very strong and powerful existing platform; second, from executing against the strategic growth drivers we outlined during our Investor Day; and third, and importantly, from our ability to continue generating significant free cash flows, which allowed us to accelerate our deleveraging and get to our current 2.6:1 debt-to-EBITDA, well below our target. Therefore, we are actively looking at a number of ways to use our increasing financial flexibility to help us accelerate our longer-term targets and enhance shareholder value.
Against this backdrop, I'd like to walk you now through Mylan's outstanding third quarter performance, which was characterized by strong double-digit revenue growth in our Specialty, North America and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in Europe. In addition, our gross margin increased nearly 400 basis points year-over-year to 52%.
Starting with North America generics business, we reported third-party net revenues of $831 million, a year-over-year increase of 19% at constant currency. Driving the increase were new product launches during the quarter, which contributed to $258 million and included Valsartan and HCTZ in September with 180 days of exclusivity, Modafinil in August and pioglitazone and pioglitazone Metformin also in August, and those with 180 days of exclusivity. The launches offset lower pricing and volume on existing products. 
As of the end of the third quarter, we had introduced 47 new products this year in the U.S., including 17 that were first-to-file or limited competition. In Canada, as of the end of the third quarter, we had launched a record 22 new products, revenues from which contributed to favorable year-over-year sales growth in that market. 
In addition, revenues from our Institutional business grew by nearly 25% on a constant currency basis during the quarter with new products and higher volumes responsible for most of the growth. 
In Europe, we reported third-party net revenues of $326 million, a year-over-year increase of 3% at constant currency. Many of our European markets realized increased sales, an encouraging sign that the region may finally be turning a corner. In addition, I'd note that as of the second quarter, the latest period for which data are available, generic utilization has risen year-over-year in the 19 European countries where we do business. As of the end of the third quarter, Mylan executed 270 country product launches in Europe during the year. These launches, along with favorable volumes on existing products, where the primary drivers of our improved performance during the third quarter. The higher product volumes included double-digit growth in France, Italy and Spain, which offset some lower pricing resulting from government mandates and competitive conditions. 
France saw the most significant revenue increase in absolute terms as local currency sales rose 9% compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to new product launches, revenues benefited from the recently signed pharmaceutical convention, which contributed to a 7% point increase in substitution among repertoire-listed products from May to August. We also are seeing growth in the French generics market overall in volume and value, and we remain the market leader. 
We observed similar trends in Italy where new products and higher volumes more than offset the impact of government-mandated price reductions. I'd also note that Italy's government has passed a law requiring general practitioners to prescribe INN products for patients starting new treatments for chronic and acute conditions. Italy is one of the fastest-growing generic markets in Europe, and we are the country's fastest-growing major player.
In Asia Pacific, we reported third-party net revenues of $339 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 21%. Our Mylan Lab subsidiary in India, along with Japan and New Zealand, all experienced higher third-party sales. India accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant sales growth of finished-dosage-form ARVs and significant growth in API. 
In Australia, where we continue to maintain our leadership position, sales were lower operationally due mainly to steep price cuts made by the government during the year. 
Sales in Japan rose with higher volumes mainly in the distributor channel, and new product launches offset NIH pricing cuts that took effect during the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see increased generic utilization. 
Also during the third quarter, we announced an exclusive long-term strategic collaboration with Pfizer to drive sustained growth for our combined Generics business in Japan. This unique partnership, unprecedented in our industry, leverages the core strength of both organizations and creates a powerful platform that we expect will be a leader in Japan in terms of scale, scope and quality. 
Our Specialty segment, we reported third-party net revenues of $294 million, a year-over-year increase of 37%. Sales of EPIPEN in the U.S. accounted for most of the increase with a growth of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2011. Our third quarter is essentially the strongest for sales of this product, and our growth this quarter came off a very strong quarter last year. 
I'd also note that we continue to see our efforts around market expansion pay off. Through the first 9 months of 2012, the percentage of at-risk individuals in the U.S. who have billed [ph] their prescription for EPIPEN auto-injector has risen from 7% to 10%. More importantly, the growth potential for this franchise remains significant.
As I move on now to some of our other drivers of growth through 2018, I'd like to reinforce that each driver and our broad basket of opportunities is weighted based on its unique risk-reward profile and projected long-term contribution. Our success and ability to achieve our targets doesn't depend on any one driver, and instead, our success is based on the global scale and leverage we have created and our ability to invest and execute on these opportunities. 
With respect to our global Institutional business, we continue to grow and expand our relationships with key customers and invest in the future of this franchise. A few weeks ago, we agreed to purchase an oncology manufacturing facility in India from SMS Pharmaceuticals. The facility will produce active pharmaceuticals in finished dosage forms and begin commercial operation as soon as the FDA completes its inspection, which is expected to occur in the next few months. The transaction should close early in the first quarter of 2013.
With respect to geographic expansion, we launched commercial operations in India in August, entering the market with a comprehensive portfolio of ARV products for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. We also were selected as a leading supplier of ARV drugs to India's National AIDS Control Organization. I'd note that both of these developments also support our ARV growth driver. And in addition to our expansion in India, we are poised to establish a physical presence shortly in Thailand. 
Portfolio diversity is another important growth driver, and we remain excited about the women's health care Franchise we are establishing in partnership with Famy Care. During the third quarter, we launched 2 oral contraceptives in Germany. We also launched one this week in Canada. And in addition, we have 34 oral contraceptives pending approval with the FDA and expect commercialization to begin in next year's first quarter.
With respect to our biologics driver, we have continued to advance the development of our 5 lead products. We have held positive meetings with the authorities in the U.S. and Europe to discuss our biologics program. In addition, we are pleased to report that we initiated our first global Phase III clinical trial on Herceptin in October. 
Clearly, Mylan continues to operate and grow from a position of great strength, and we look forward to leveraging that strength further to deliver even more value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John, and I look forward to responding to your questions."

This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I'll refer you back to Chris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
Let me start by saying by any measure, the third quarter of 2012 was an exceptional quarter for Mylan. I would like to highlight upfront some of our financial accomplishments. 
Quarterly revenue of $1.8 billion, the highest amount of revenue in any quarter in our company's history, and revenue grew on a constant currency basis in every region of the world including Europe. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83, more than we earned in all of 2008 and were achieved while continue to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives. 
Adjusted operating cash flow of $469 million, the most ever for our company in one quarter, and free cash flow of $424 million, which allowed us to repay borrowings during the quarter of $459 million. 
And to the end of the quarter -- and to end the quarter with a growth leverage ratio of 2.7:1, or 2.6:1 when you consider an additional $100 million of borrowings, which we repaid in early October.
On the heels of this strong quarter, we are once again increasing our range of EPS guidance for the full year 2012. We're now projecting adjusted diluted EPS of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, increased from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. We are also revising upward our free cash flow expectations for 2012. We now expect adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2012, which is at the very upper end of our 2012 operating cash flow guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion. 
Additionally, as a result of the timing and rationalization of some of our capital programs, our gross capital spending in 2012 is now anticipated to approximate $300 million. The net of these 2 amounts represents our current 2012 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million, or $100 million higher than the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations.
Our remaining guidance metrics for 2012 remain unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them in a few minutes. And our targets for 2013 and beyond remain unchanged.
In February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2013 financial guidance, which reflects recent developments at our most up-to-date outlook.
So Mylan has never been better positioned as a company. Today, we possess an unmatched vertically integrated footprint, a broad and growing product portfolio with a robust pipeline of future new product launches and longer-term strategic growth drivers such as our respiratory and biologics platforms. 
Additionally, though, Mylan possesses today the financial flexibility to take advantage of shareholder value accretion opportunity. With our current leverage ratio now meaningfully below our long-term target of 3:1 and our growing EBITDA, today we have over $4 billion of financial flexibility for earnings accretive transactions. That said, Mylan will do never do a transaction merely for the sake of a transaction or only for financial reasons. Any transaction must also be the right transaction strategically. Further, we remain committed to our 3:1 long-term growth leverage target. And if we increase our leverage above this target, we would be committed to deleveraging within an 18-month time frame.
With that introduction, let me now get into the details and walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 14% over last year's third quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 19%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to each of the other functional currencies of our major operations mainly in Europe and India.
Our top line growth was driven by higher volumes on a consolidated basis, including significant amounts from our 2012 new product launches as well as favorable sales volume in Europe and Asia Pacific, which served to more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower pricing throughout the world. In fact, driven by higher volumes and new product introductions, each of the countries in Europe in which we have significant operations, with the exception of Germany, turned in favorable year-over-year constant currency sales growth. 
For the first 9 months of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of 10% over revenues from the first 9 months of 2011, or 14% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion. Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this guidance range as a result of the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, however, we are projecting to be closer to the midpoint of the range.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 third quarter at 52% was above our guidance range of 48% to 50% and represented an increase over the same prior year period of nearly 400 basis points. This increase was driven by new product launches and favorable volumes and pricing on our EPIPEN auto-injector, partially offset by lower margins on existing products. The current quarter also saw margin improvement from our Indian subsidiary, where sales and gross profit benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 50% as compared to 48% in the prior year. We currently expect to be at the upper end of our gross margin guidance range for the full year.
Adjusted operating income was $513 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 32% increase from Q3 2011 and up 29% from the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increases, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit, was realized in spite of increased levels of investment in both R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense for the quarter on an adjusted basis was $104 million, or approximately 5.8% of total revenues, and up approximately 51% from the prior year. This increase was mainly a result of ongoing spending with respect to our respiratory and biologics program, including clinical studies. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $324 million for the quarter, or approximately 18% of total revenues, and up approximately 5% over the prior year. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased selling and marketing in our Specialty franchise. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher payroll and related costs as we continued to build out our infrastructure platform in certain targeted areas.
For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $277 million, up 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.5%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be at or slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.
SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, was $964 million, an increase of nearly 10% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $567 million and $1.4 billion for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. We expect to be near the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $1.75 -- or $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion for the full year.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $183 million and is forecasted to be at the low end of the guidance range of $245 million to $265 million for the full year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that we will be at the lower end of this range for the calendar year 2012.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $341 million, or $0.83 a share, a 51% increase from our Q3 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55 per share. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $820 million, or $1.94 per share, a 28% increase over the same prior year period. 
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS is now $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Our estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release, was approximately $818 million for the year-to-date period and a very strong $469 million for the quarter. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date periods was a very strong cash inflow of $460 million and $652 million, respectively, and left us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling $366 million. As noted earlier, we were forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion, the high end of our guidance range.
We have been very focused throughout 2012 on operating working capital. On a constant -- on constant currency net sales growth of 19% in the third quarter and 14% through the first 9 months of 2012, we have been able to limit the growth in our operating working capital to approximately 9%, exclusive of FX impacts, as we continue to bring operational efficiencies to our global platform.
Third quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date period to nearly $160 million. And as a result of the timing of planned expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.
As I mentioned before, these updated estimates yield a current free cash flow estimate of $700 million for the year, which is $100 million stronger than our previously communicated expectation as we continue to generate an increasing amount of cash flow from our global platform.
To summarize, our third quarter exceeded even our high expectations and, as anticipated, positions us for a very strong finish to 2012. Our strong track record for organic growth, coupled with the long-term growth drivers, which Heather discussed, and our significant financial flexibility all translate into what should be an exciting 2013 and beyond for Mylan. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Maria?"

So Marc, I'll start with the U.S. So I guess I'd like to first start off by saying against our estimates, our U.S. business performed right in line with where we thought it would be. So while we absolutely had a significant amount of launches that we forecasted and projected at the beginning of the year, that '12 would be a great year for our U.S. Generics business. I think that if you look at the timing of the launches throughout the quarters, and some of that pulled through even from launches we had earlier in the year, so all I can tell you is that absolutely performed in line with where we thought it would. We think it still is showing strength in the base business as well as our continued launches that we have for the remainder of the year. So from our perspective, U.S. business, hitting on all cylinders. Europe profitability, I think as we have talked about in the past that we constantly, through this entire macroeconomic situation throughout Europe, have balanced our top and bottom line growth. You've heard me quarter after quarter coming and saying we weren't going to chase the bottom, that there's been irrational behavior and that we would continue to hold steady and control what we can control. So in this period of time, we've done just that. We've continued to increase the profitability around our cost of goods by continuing to vertically integrate and be 100% responsible for our global supply chain. We've continued to make sure that we're structured in the right way with some of the evolving businesses and as they are continuing to change in the different countries. And I think most importantly, and why I wanted to point out in my script, that in all the countries we're doing business, we see an increase in generic conversion. And I think that should be the brightest spot of all because what it shows is that governments very much are beginning to recognize the long-term sustainability that generic utilization brings versus a onetime price cut. So we've seen additional initiatives in Italy, we've seen additional initiatives in France that are bringing those back up. So from my perspective, we certainly have always maintained a need to balance profitable and revenues. I think that our results this quarter are paying off from how we're operating our business in Europe. And lastly, on the Institutional side, in February, we showed our Institutional business being an important strategic growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in that business. We have numerous launches. We're continuing to very much accelerate our own internal R&D pipeline around this businesses globally. So all I can say is that we certainly are continuing to invest and continue to see this as a very important growth driver for us in the future."

I'm wondering if you can just -- am I reading that right? In previous conference calls, we've talked about options on the table to enhance shareholder value: share buybacks, bringing down debt, strategic deals. But what I'm hearing from you today is I think a more outspoken commitment or desire to pursue something strategic. And then secondly, I'm very intrigued with the partnership that you signed with Pfizer in Japan, and I'm wondering if you could put some numbers around that, what you see in terms of revenue potential over the next 5 years and what that means to your bottom line. And is this the type of partnership that you see could be replicated in other countries, such as emerging markets where, again, Pfizer doesn't have the AND capabilities that you have and you don't have the feet on the ground that Pfizer has?"

When I -- what I spoke of in my opening remarks was a combination, if you'll remember. I said of us continuing to execute on our existing platform, continuing to execute against the growth drivers we pointed out. And then obviously, the last point was to looking at ways that we're going to use our increased financial flexibility. And I think, as you have seen, that has been a combination, and I think it will continue to be. There's a lot of ways to increase shareholder value, and I think what you can rely on is that we're looking at all of them. Now we certainly are looking at any and all compelling acquisitions that would allow us to continue to deliver or accelerate the trajectory that we're already on. I mean, when look at what we have put out there with our own assets at this time, a 15% CAGR in 2018 is an impressive growth target out there. And I think that as -- this financial flexibility just gives us all that much more ability to accelerate not only that growth but, like I said, in many different ways. As far as Japan goes, look, I think it's an unprecedented deal in our industry. I think it truly does take the core competencies of both of our organizations, and we believe that 1 plus 1 will equal 3-plus. It's about really leveraging the scale and scope and the quality of what we both bring to the table. So while we don't get into putting numbers out there around individual countries, I think you certainly can expect that we believe that this is accretive to our current stand-alone Generics business as well as accretive to their stand-alone Generics business, and that's why the rationale of this deal made all the sense in the world. And I very much believe that it could be a model in other countries where the troops on the ground are important, the brand is important, but having the breadth and the quality of a pipeline is equally as important. And that's where this makes all the sense in the world and very much could make sense in other countries as we move forward."

As far as WELLBUTRIN, look, I think that it's very important to understand that this is a one-off issue and it really does not speak to the generic industry. I will say it speaks to the pharmaceutical industry overall. As you know, from time to time, as FDA continues to gather data and look at data, there are times where they've taken brand products off the market as well as changing guidelines and changing specs. So this is something that's constantly going on within the FDA in looking and working with companies. I think in this particular instance, it was certainly related to patient safety. FDA made a judgment call years ago around the 300 milligram. I mean, the data today that they're looking at has caused them to get to a different place. Certainly, we don't see those impacting our product and believe this was certainly in relation to just one in particular formulation. So I would tell you that our industry is alive and well, and I don't really see this having any impact on that whatsoever. Thank you."

I guess what I would say, not only do I not agree with them, I have to believe that their credibility should be extremely tarnished at this point. I mean, based at all the exact same things about Watson, Watson was never going to be able to get their approval. They had all kinds of issues. And certainly, Endo was proven to be wrong. I think when you look at Endo trying to stress that based on their experience and expertise in this development, this is not their product. They didn't license this. So I think as to -- to talk about what kind of science is out there and who has the capability, I can assure you we are manufacturing and developing our own products, and I believe we do have the expertise and the track record with FDA to know and to be able to guide you guys, as we have been, about what we're capable of doing. So I -- that's what I would say about Endo's comments. And we absolutely continue to see this as a possible opportunity in the second half of the year. As you know, FDA historically doesn't make exclusivity decisions until they have to. And so we maintain our ability to get this product approved in 2013 and be able to manufacture the quantities needed. And like I said, we still absolutely believe we have the potential for this to be upside second half of '13. So thank you."

I was just trying to understand here if the scope of what you're looking at has changed or if this is just trying to come back to some of the assets that you've considered before. And the second question was on your Europe. It seems like we're finally seeing encouraging macro trends. Can you talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics you're seeing in the market? I think Heather last quarter discussed a bit of a shift, focusing more on profitability versus share in Europe, and I'm just wondering if you're -- how you're seeing the overall competitive environment kind of shaking out."

And as I said, I'll just revert back to saying a very compelling -- there's a lot of compelling opportunities out there, and we're looking at all of the. And just quickly on the environment in Europe. I guess what I would say is we've always stressed the profitability as well as market share, as well as revenue growth and balance all of that. I can't speak to other companies perhaps being as balanced as in their commentary around Europe, but that's why I wanted to stress that I think that has definitely paid off for us not only to maintain leadership position but be able to execute and control what we can.

Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Operating Officer, Hal Korman; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.
During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making numerous forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often may be identified by the use of words such as may, will, could, should, would, project, believe, anticipate, expect, plan, estimate, guidance, trends, forecasts, potential, intend, continue and variations of these words or comparable words.
Our forward-looking statements may today, including, among others, statements relating to anticipated business levels; trends in some European countries; planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products; our ability to achieve forecasted full year results while absorbing the impact of negative pricing pressures; expectations for capital expenditures; expectations for R&D, SG&A and other spending; our guidance range, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth and other expectations and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the fourth quarter and for 2012 overall. Because these statements are forward looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties, and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under Forward-looking Statements in our recent earnings press release dated October 25, 2012, as well as the risk factors set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, and our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, including our earnings press release, which we filed on Form 8-K, through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so.
In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted revenue, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS, should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.
Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website as well as on the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to our third quarter results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather."

Our third quarter constant currency revenues rose 20% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.83. I'd like to note that we did more this quarter than we did in all of 2008 with essentially the same assets. This only further highlights the power of our organic growth capabilities. Of course, these milestones could only have been achieved through the hard work, dedication and commitment of all of our employees.

We also are reaffirming our 2013 target of $2.75 per share and our longer-term target of at least $6 per share in 2018. We expect to provide detailed guidance for 2013 in February when we release our fourth quarter and year-end results. We will discuss our longer-term outlook in July during our Investor Day event, which we will host in New York. 
Our ability to deliver consistently strong results, take swift advantage of opportunities and become ever more efficient, all while mitigating risk and absorbing economic headwinds and price cuts, give Mylan a unique profile in this industry. With that said, our expectation of continued growth will come from a combination of things: first, from the continued organic growth of our very strong and powerful existing platform; second, from executing against the strategic growth drivers we outlined during our Investor Day; and third, and importantly, from our ability to continue generating significant free cash flows, which allowed us to accelerate our deleveraging and get to our current 2.6:1 debt-to-EBITDA, well below our target. Therefore, we are actively looking at a number of ways to use our increasing financial flexibility to help us accelerate our longer-term targets and enhance shareholder value.
Against this backdrop, I'd like to walk you now through Mylan's outstanding third quarter performance, which was characterized by strong double-digit revenue growth in our Specialty, North America and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in Europe. In addition, our gross margin increased nearly 400 basis points year-over-year to 52%.
Starting with North America Generics business, we reported third-party net revenues of $831 million, a year-over-year increase of 19% at constant currency. Driving the increase were new product launches during the quarter, which contributed to $258 million and included Valsartan HCTZ in September with 180 days of exclusivity, Modafinil in August and pioglitazone and pioglitazone Metformin also in August, and both with 180 days of exclusivity. The launches offset lower pricing and volume on existing products. 
As of the end of the third quarter, we had introduced 47 new products this year in the U.S., including 17 that were first-to-file or limited competition. In Canada, as of the end of the third quarter, we had launched a record 22 new products, revenue from which contributed to favorable year-over-year sales growth in that market. 
In addition, revenues from our Institutional business grew by nearly 25% on a constant currency basis during the quarter with new products and higher volumes responsible for most of the growth. 
In Europe, we reported third-party net revenues of $326 million, a year-over-year increase of 3% at constant currency. Many of our European markets realized increased sales, an encouraging sign that the region may finally be turning a corner. In addition, I'd note that as of the second quarter, the latest period for which data are available, generic utilization has risen year-over-year in the 19 European countries where we do business. As of the end of the third quarter, Mylan executed 200 country product launches in Europe during the year. These launches, along with favorable volumes on existing products, were the primary drivers of our improved performance during the third quarter. The higher product volumes included double-digit growth in France, Italy and Spain, which offset some lower pricing resulting from government mandates and competitive conditions. 
France saw the most significant revenue increase in absolute terms as local currency sales rose 9% compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to new product launches, revenues benefited from the recently signed pharmaceutical convention, which contributed to a 7% point increase in substitution among repertoire-listed [ph] products from May to August. We also are seeing growth in the French generics market overall in volume and value, and we remain the market leader. 
We observed similar trends in Italy where new products and higher volumes more than offset the impact of government-mandated price reductions. I'd also note that Italy's government has passed a law requiring general practitioners to prescribe INN products for patients starting new treatments for chronic and acute conditions. Italy is one of the fastest-growing generic markets in Europe, and we are the country's fastest-growing major player.
In Asia Pacific, we reported third-party net revenues of $339 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 21%. Our Mylan Lab subsidiary in India, along with Japan and New Zealand, all experienced higher third-party sales. India accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant sales growth of finished-dosage-form ARVs and significant growth in API. 
In Australia, where we continue to maintain our leadership position, sales were lower operationally due mainly to steep price cuts made by the government during the year. 
Sales in Japan rose as higher volumes, mainly in the distributor channel, and new product launches offset NIH pricing cuts that took effect during the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see increased generic utilization. 
Also during the third quarter, we announced an exclusive long-term strategic collaboration with Pfizer to drive sustained growth for our combined Generics business in Japan. This unique partnership, unprecedented in our industry, leverages the core strength of both organizations and creates a powerful platform that we expect will be a leader in Japan in terms of scale, scope and quality. 
Our Specialty segment, we reported third-party net revenues of $294 million, a year-over-year increase of 37%. Sales of EPIPEN in the U.S. accounted for most of the increase with a growth of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2011. Our third quarter is essentially the strongest for sales of this product, and our growth this quarter came off a very strong quarter last year. 
I'd also note that we continue to see our efforts around market expansion pay off. Through the first 9 months of 2012, the percentage of at-risk individuals in the U.S. who have filled a prescription for EPIPEN auto-injector has risen from 7% to 10%. More importantly, the growth potential for this franchise remains significant.
As I move on now to some of our other drivers of growth through 2018, I'd like to reinforce that each driver in our broad basket of opportunities is weighted based on its unique risk-reward profile and projected long-term contribution. Our success and ability to achieve our targets doesn't depend on any one driver, and instead, our success is based on the global scale and leverage we have created and our ability to invest and execute on these opportunities. 
With respect to our global Institutional business, we continue to grow and expand our relationships with key customers and invest in the future of this franchise. A few weeks ago, we agreed to purchase an oncology manufacturing facility in India from SMS Pharmaceuticals. The facility will produce active pharmaceuticals and finished dosage forms and begin commercial operation as soon as the FDA completes its inspection, which is expected to occur in the next few months. The transaction should close early in the first quarter of 2013.
With respect to geographic expansion, we launched commercial operations in India in August, entering the market with a comprehensive portfolio of ARV products for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. We also were selected as a leading supplier of ARV drugs to India's National AIDS Control Organization. I'd note that both of these developments also support our ARV growth driver. And in addition to our expansion into India, we are poised to establish a physical presence shortly in Thailand. 
Portfolio diversity is another important growth driver, and we remain excited about the women's health care franchise we are establishing in partnership with Famy Care. During the third quarter, we launched 2 oral contraceptives in Germany. We also launched one this week in Canada. And in addition, we have 34 oral contraceptives pending approval with the FDA and expect commercialization to begin in next year's first quarter.
With respect to our biologics driver, we have continued to advance the development of our 5 lead products. We have held positive meetings with the authorities in the U.S. and Europe to discuss our biologics programs. In addition, we are pleased to report that we initiated our first global Phase III clinical trial on Herceptin in October. 
Clearly, Mylan continues to operate and grow from a position of great strength, and we look forward to leveraging that strength further to deliver even more value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John, and I will look forward to responding to your questions."
290203,222537176,370442,"Mylan, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today'",1918,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
Let me start by saying by any measure, the third quarter of 2012 was an exceptional quarter for Mylan. I would like to highlight upfront some of our financial accomplishments. 
Quarterly revenue of $1.8 billion, the highest amount of revenue in any quarter in our company's history, and revenue grew on a constant currency basis in every region of the world including Europe. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83, more than we earned in all of 2008 and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives. 
Adjusted operating cash flow of $469 million, the most ever for our company in one quarter, and free cash flow of $424 million, which allowed us to repay borrowings during the quarter of $459 million. 
And to the end of the quarter -- and to end the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.7:1, or 2.6:1 when you consider an additional $100 million of borrowings, which we repaid in early October.
On the heels of this strong quarter, we are once again increasing our range of EPS guidance for the full year 2012. We're now projecting adjusted diluted EPS of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, increased from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. We are also revising upward our free cash flow expectations for 2012. We now expect adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2012, which is at the very upper end of our 2012 operating cash flow guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion. 
Additionally, as a result of the timing and rationalization of some of our capital programs, our gross capital spending in 2012 is now anticipated to approximate $300 million. The net of these 2 amounts represents our current 2012 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million, or $100 million higher than the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations.
Our remaining guidance metrics for 2012 remain unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them in a few minutes. And our targets for 2013 and beyond remain unchanged.
In February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2013 financial guidance, which reflects recent developments and our most up-to-date outlook.
So Mylan has never been better positioned as a company. Today, we possess an unmatched vertically integrated footprint, a broad and growing product portfolio with a robust pipeline of future new product launches and longer-term strategic growth drivers such as our respiratory and biologics platforms. 
Additionally, though, Mylan possesses today the financial flexibility to take advantage of shareholder value accretion opportunities. With our current leverage ratio now meaningfully below our long-term target of 3:1 and our growing EBITDA, today we have over $4 billion of financial flexibility for earnings accretive transactions. That said, Mylan will never do a transaction merely for the sake of a transaction or only for financial reasons. Any transaction must also be the right transaction strategically. Further, we remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage target. And if we increase our leverage above this target, we would be committed to deleveraging within an 18-month time frame.
With that introduction, let me now get into the details and walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 14% over last year's third quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 19%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to each of the other functional currencies of our major operations mainly in Europe and India.
Our top line growth was driven by higher volumes on a consolidated basis, including significant amounts from our 2012 new product launches as well as favorable sales volumes in Europe and Asia Pacific, which served to more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower pricing throughout the world. In fact, driven by higher volumes and new product introductions, each of the countries in Europe in which we have significant operations, with the exception of Germany, turned in favorable year-over-year constant currency sales growth. 
For the first 9 months of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of 10% over revenues from the first 9 months of 2011, or 14% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion. Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this guidance range as a result of the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, however, we are projecting to be closer to the midpoint of the range.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 third quarter at 52% was above our guidance range of 48% to 50% and represented an increase over the same prior year period of nearly 400 basis points. This increase was driven by new product launches and favorable volume and pricing on our EPIPEN auto-injector, partially offset by lower margin on existing products. The current quarter also saw margin improvement from our Indian subsidiary, where sales and gross profit benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 50% as compared to 48% in the prior year. We currently expect to be at the upper end of our gross margin guidance range for the full year.
Adjusted operating income was $513 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 32% increase from Q3 2011 and up 29% from the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increases, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit, was realized in spite of increased levels of investment in both R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense for the quarter on an adjusted basis was $104 million, or approximately 5.8% of total revenues, and up approximately 51% from the prior year. This increase was mainly a result of ongoing spending with respect to our respiratory and biologics program, including clinical studies. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $324 million for the quarter, or approximately 18% of total revenues, and up approximately 5% over the prior year. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased selling and marketing in our Specialty franchise. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher payroll and related costs as we continue to build out our infrastructure platform in certain targeted areas.
For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $277 million, up 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.5%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be at or slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.
SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, was $964 million, an increase of nearly 10% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $567 million and $1.4 billion for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. We expect to be near the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $1.75 -- of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion for the full year.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $183 million and is forecasted to be at the low end of the guidance range of $245 million to $265 million for the full year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that we will be at the lower end of this range for the calendar year 2012.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $341 million, or $0.83 a share, a 51% increase from our Q3 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55 per share. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $820 million, or $1.94 per share, a 28% increase over the same prior year period. 
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS is now $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Our estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release, was approximately $818 million for the year-to-date period and a very strong $469 million for the quarter. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $460 million and $652 million, respectively, and left us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling [ph] $366 million. As noted earlier, we are forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion, the high end of our guidance range.
We have been very focused throughout 2012 on operating working capital. On a constant -- on constant currency net sales growth of 19% in the third quarter and 14% through the first 9 months of 2012, we have been able to limit the growth in our operating working capital to approximately 9%, exclusive of FX impacts, as we continue to bring operational efficiencies to our global platform.
Third quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date period to nearly $160 million. And as a result of the timing of planned expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.
As I mentioned before, these updated estimates yield a current free cash flow estimate of $700 million for the year, which is $100 million stronger than our previously communicated expectation as we continue to generate an increasing amount of cash flow from our global platform.
To summarize, our third quarter exceeded even our high expectations and, as anticipated, positions us for a very strong finish to 2012. Our strong track record for organic growth, coupled with the long-term growth drivers which Heather discussed, and our significant financial flexibility all translate into what should be an exciting 2013 and beyond for Mylan. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Maria?"

So Marc, I'll start with the U.S. So I guess I'd like to first start off by saying against our estimates, our U.S. business performed right in line with where we thought it would be. So while we absolutely had a significant amount of launches that we forecasted and projected at the beginning of the year, that '12 would be a great year for our U.S. Generics business. I think that if you look at the timing of the launches throughout the quarters, and some of that pull-through even from launches we had earlier in the year, so all I can tell you is that absolutely performed in line with where we thought it would. We think it still is showing strength in the base business as well as our continued launches that we have for the remainder of the year. So from our perspective, U.S. business, hitting on all cylinders. Europe profitability, I think as we have talked about in the past that we constantly, through this entire macroeconomic situation throughout Europe, have balanced our top and bottom line growth. You've heard me quarter after quarter coming and saying we weren't going to chase the bottom, that there's been irrational behavior and that we would continue to hold steady and control what we can control. So in this period of time, we've done just that. We've continued to increase the profitability around our cost of goods by continuing to vertically integrate and be 100% responsible for our global supply chain. We've continued to make sure that we're structured in the right way with some of the evolving businesses and as they are continuing to change in the different countries. And I think most importantly, and why I wanted to point out in my script, that in all the countries we're doing business, we see an increase in generic conversion. And I think that should be the brightest spot of all because what it shows is that governments very much are beginning to recognize the long-term sustainability that generic utilization brings versus a onetime price cut. So we've seen additional initiatives in Italy, we've seen additional initiatives in France that are bringing those back up. So from my perspective, we certainly have always maintained the need to balance profitable and revenues. I think that our results this quarter are paying off from how we're operating our business in Europe. And lastly, on the Institutional side, in February, we showed our Institutional business being an important strategic growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in that business. We have numerous launches. We're continuing to very much accelerate our own internal R&D pipeline around this businesses globally. So all I can say is that we certainly are continuing to invest and continue to see this as a very important growth driver for us in the future."

And then obviously, the last point was to looking at ways that we're going to use our increased financial flexibility. And I think, as you have seen, that has been a combination, and I think it will continue to be. There's a lot of ways to increase shareholder value, and I think what you can rely on is that we're looking at all of them. And we certainly are looking at any and all compelling acquisitions that would allow us to continue to deliver or accelerate the trajectory that we're already on. I mean, when you look at what we have put out there with our own assets at this time, a 15% CAGR in 2018 is an impressive growth target out there. And I think that as -- this financial flexibility just gives us all that much more ability to accelerate not only that growth but, like I said, in many different ways. As far as Japan goes, look, I think it's an unprecedented deal in our industry. I think it truly does take the core competencies of both of our organizations, and we believe that 1 plus 1 will equal 3-plus. It's about really leveraging the scale and scope and the quality of what we both bring to the table. So while we don't get into putting numbers out there around individual countries, I think you certainly can expect that we believe that this is accretive to our current stand-alone Generics business as well as accretive to their stand-alone Generics business, and that's why the rationale of this deal made all the sense in the world. And I very much believe that it could be a model in other countries where the troops on the ground are important, the brand is important, but having the breadth and the quality of a pipeline is equally as important. And that's where this makes all the sense in the world and very much could make sense in other countries as we move forward."

To be honest with you, I don't really want to give future expectations as to what 2013 or 2014 is going to be. That's not the purpose of the call today. But what I can tell you, and it's demonstrated by the working capital efficiency that we've had here in 2013, is that our global operating teams are intensely focused on generating cash and then for our ability to put that cash back to work in the business for the benefit of our shareholders.

And we start to see all 3 of those things hitting, and, like I said, we do foresee that continuing. So that's kind of is as far as I'm willing to go with my crystal ball. But I can tell you we're excited about the direction Europe is moving and see that continuing. As far as WELLBUTRIN, look, I think that it's very important to understand that this is a one-off issue and it really does not speak to the generic industry. I will say it speaks to the pharmaceutical industry overall. As you know, from time to time, as FDA continues to gather data and look at data, there are times where they've taken brand products off the market as well as changing guidelines and changing specs. So this is something that's constantly going on within the FDA in looking and working with companies. I think in this particular instance, it was certainly related to patient safety. FDA made a judgment call years ago around the 300 milligram. And when -- the data today that they're looking at has caused them to get to a different place. Certainly, we don't see this impacting our product and believe this was certainly in relation to just one in particular formulation. So I would tell you that our industry is alive and well, and I don't really see this having any impact on that whatsoever. Thank you."

Endo management made some very pointed comments about their perceived or their perceptions around your ability to obtain approval for their product based on its nonaqueous nature and the possibility of some excipient and adhesion issues. I'm assuming that you don't agree with that, but maybe you can just sort of comment a little bit on sort of their observations. And then with Watson now having obtained approval, still some ambiguity around the issue of exclusivity. The FDA made it very clear in the approval letter that Watson did not obtain approval within 30 months but did not actually make a decision on exclusivity. You said previously that you still thought generic Lidoderm was a possibility in terms of your ability to launch in 2013, and I'm just wondering if you still believe that to be the case based on anything new that's happening at the FDA with regard to the application and then based on the Watson approval."

I think when you look at Endo trying to stress that based on their experience and expertise in this development, this is not their product. They have end-licensed  it. So I think to talk about what kind of science is out there and who has the capability, I can assure you we are manufacturing and developing our own product, and I believe we do have the expertise and the track record with FDA to know and to be able to guide you guys, as we have been, about what we're capable of doing. So I -- that's what I would say about Endo's comments. And we absolutely continue to see this as a possible opportunity in the second half of the year. As you know, FDA historically doesn't make exclusivity decisions until they have to.

And just quickly on the environment in Europe. I guess what I would say is we've always stressed the profitability as well as market share, as well as revenue growth and balanced all of that. I can't speak to other companies perhaps being as balanced as in their commentary around Europe, but that's why I wanted to stress that I think that has definitely paid off for us not only to maintain leadership position but be able to execute and control what we can.

I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. Our third q",1566,"Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. 
Our third quarter constant currency revenues rose 20% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.83. I'd like to note that we did more this quarter than we did in all of 2008 with essentially the same assets. This only further highlights the power of our organic growth capabilities. Of course, these milestones could only have been achieved through the hard work, dedication and commitment of all of our employees. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank all of them.
Now with 3 very successful quarters behind us this year, we are raising our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. We also are reaffirming our 2013 target of $2.75 per share and our longer-term target of at least $6 per share in 2018. We expect to provide detailed guidance for 2013 in February when we release our fourth quarter and year-end results. We will discuss our longer-term outlook in July during our Investor Day event, which we will host in New York. 
Our ability to deliver consistently strong results, take swift advantage of opportunities and become ever more efficient, all while mitigating risk and absorbing economic headwinds and price cuts, give Mylan a unique profile in this industry. With that said, our expectation of continued growth will come from a combination of things: first, from the continued organic growth of our very strong and powerful existing platform; second, from executing against the strategic growth drivers we outlined during our Investor Day; and third, and importantly, from our ability to continue generating significant free cash flows, which allowed us to accelerate our deleveraging and get to our current 2.6:1 debt-to-EBITDA, well below our target. Therefore, we are actively looking at a number of ways to use our increasing financial flexibility to help us accelerate our longer-term targets and enhance shareholder value.
Against this backdrop, I'd like to walk you now through Mylan's outstanding third quarter performance, which was characterized by strong double-digit revenue growth in our Specialty, North America and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in Europe. In addition, our gross margin increased nearly 400 basis points year-over-year to 52%.
Starting with North America Generics business, we reported third-party net revenues of $831 million, a year-over-year increase of 19% at constant currency. Driving the increase were new product launches during the quarter, which contributed to $258 million and included Valsartan HCTZ in September with 180 days of exclusivity, Modafinil in August and pioglitazone and pioglitazone Metformin also in August, and both with 180 days of exclusivity. The launches offset lower pricing and volume on existing products. 
As of the end of the third quarter, we had introduced 47 new products this year in the U.S., including 17 that were first-to-file or limited competition. In Canada, as of the end of the third quarter, we had launched a record 22 new products, revenue from which contributed to favorable year-over-year sales growth in that market. 
In addition, revenues from our Institutional business grew by nearly 25% on a constant currency basis during the quarter with new products and higher volumes responsible for most of the growth. 
In Europe, we reported third-party net revenues of $326 million, a year-over-year increase of 3% at constant currency. Many of our European markets realized increased sales, an encouraging sign that the region may finally be turning a corner. In addition, I'd note that as of the second quarter, the latest period for which data are available, generic utilization has risen year-over-year in the 19 European countries where we do business. As of the end of the third quarter, Mylan executed 200 country product launches in Europe during the year. These launches, along with favorable volumes on existing products, were the primary drivers of our improved performance during the third quarter. The higher product volumes included double-digit growth in France, Italy and Spain, which offset some lower pricing resulting from government mandates and competitive conditions. 
France saw the most significant revenue increase in absolute terms as local currency sales rose 9% compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to new product launches, revenues benefited from the recently signed pharmaceutical convention, which contributed to a 7% point increase in substitution among repertoire-listed products from May to August. We also are seeing growth in the French generics market overall in volume and value, and we remain the market leader. 
We observed similar trends in Italy where new products and higher volumes more than offset the impact of government-mandated price reductions. I'd also note that Italy's government has passed a law requiring general practitioners to prescribe INN products for patients starting new treatments for chronic and acute conditions. Italy is one of the fastest-growing generic markets in Europe, and we are the country's fastest-growing major player.
In Asia Pacific, we reported third-party net revenues of $339 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 21%. Our Mylan Lab subsidiary in India, along with Japan and New Zealand, all experienced higher third-party sales. India accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant sales growth of finished-dosage-form ARVs and significant growth in API. 
In Australia, where we continue to maintain our leadership position, sales were lower operationally due mainly to steep price cuts made by the government during the year. 
Sales in Japan rose as higher volumes, mainly in the distributor channel, and new product launches offset NIH pricing cuts that took effect during the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see increased generic utilization. 
Also during the third quarter, we announced an exclusive long-term strategic collaboration with Pfizer to drive sustained growth for our combined Generics business in Japan. This unique partnership, unprecedented in our industry, leverages the core strength of both organizations and creates a powerful platform that we expect will be a leader in Japan in terms of scale, scope and quality. 
Our Specialty segment, we reported third-party net revenues of $294 million, a year-over-year increase of 37%. Sales of EPIPEN in the U.S. accounted for most of the increase with a growth of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2011. Our third quarter is essentially the strongest for sales of this product, and our growth this quarter came off a very strong quarter last year. 
I'd also note that we continue to see our efforts around market expansion pay off. Through the first 9 months of 2012, the percentage of at-risk individuals in the U.S. who have filled a prescription for EPIPEN auto-injector has risen from 7% to 10%. More importantly, the growth potential for this franchise remains significant.
As I move on now to some of our other drivers of growth through 2018, I'd like to reinforce that each driver in our broad basket of opportunities is weighted based on its unique risk-reward profile and projected long-term contribution. Our success and ability to achieve our targets doesn't depend on any one driver, and instead, our success is based on the global scale and leverage we have created and our ability to invest and execute on these opportunities. 
With respect to our global Institutional business, we continue to grow and expand our relationships with key customers and invest in the future of this franchise. A few weeks ago, we agreed to purchase an oncology manufacturing facility in India from SMS Pharmaceuticals. The facility will produce active pharmaceuticals and finished dosage forms and begin commercial operation as soon as the FDA completes its inspection, which is expected to occur in the next few months. The transaction should close early in the first quarter of 2013.
With respect to geographic expansion, we launched commercial operations in India in August, entering the market with a comprehensive portfolio of ARV products for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. We also were selected as a leading supplier of ARV drugs to India's National AIDS Control Organization. I'd note that both of these developments also support our ARV growth driver. And in addition to our expansion into India, we are poised to establish a physical presence shortly in Thailand. 
Portfolio diversity is another important growth driver, and we remain excited about the women's health care franchise we are establishing in partnership with Famy Care. During the third quarter, we launched 2 oral contraceptives in Germany. We also launched one this week in Canada. And in addition, we have 34 oral contraceptives pending approval with the FDA and expect commercialization to begin in next year's first quarter.
With respect to our biologics driver, we have continued to advance the development of our 5 lead products. We have held positive meetings with the authorities in the U.S. and Europe to discuss our biologics programs. In addition, we are pleased to report that we initiated our first global Phase III clinical trial on Herceptin in October. 
Clearly, Mylan continues to operate and grow from a position of great strength, and we look forward to leveraging that strength further to deliver even more value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John, and I will look forward to responding to your questions."
290203,222537176,371102,"Mylan, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today'",1917,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.
Let me start by saying by any measure, the third quarter of 2012 was an exceptional quarter for Mylan. I would like to highlight upfront some of our financial accomplishments. 
Quarterly revenue of $1.8 billion, the highest amount of revenue in any quarter in our company's history, and revenue grew on a constant currency basis in every region of the world including Europe. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83, more than we earned in all of 2008 and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives. 
Adjusted operating cash flow of $469 million, the most ever for our company in one quarter, and free cash flow of $424 million, which allowed us to repay borrowings during the quarter of $459 million. 
And to the end of the quarter -- and to end the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.7:1, or 2.6:1 when you consider an additional $100 million of borrowings, which we repaid in early October.
On the heels of this strong quarter, we are once again increasing our range of EPS guidance for the full year 2012. We're now projecting adjusted diluted EPS of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, increased from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. We are also revising upward our free cash flow expectations for 2012. We now expect adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2012, which is at the very upper end of our 2012 operating cash flow guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion. 
Additionally, as a result of the timing and rationalization of some of our capital programs, our gross capital spending in 2012 is now anticipated to approximate $300 million. The net of these 2 amounts represents our current 2012 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million, or $100 million higher than the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations.
Our remaining guidance metrics for 2012 remain unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them in a few minutes. And our targets for 2013 and beyond remain unchanged.
In February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2013 financial guidance, which reflects recent developments and our most up-to-date outlook.
So Mylan has never been better positioned as a company. Today, we possess an unmatched vertically integrated footprint, a broad and growing product portfolio with a robust pipeline of future new product launches and longer-term strategic growth drivers such as our respiratory and biologics platforms. 
Additionally, though, Mylan possesses today the financial flexibility to take advantage of shareholder value accretion opportunities. With our current leverage ratio now meaningfully below our long-term target of 3:1 and our growing EBITDA, today we have over $4 billion of financial flexibility for earnings accretive transactions. That said, Mylan will never do a transaction merely for the sake of a transaction or only for financial reasons. Any transaction must also be the right transaction strategically. Further, we remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage target. And if we increase our leverage above this target, we would be committed to deleveraging within an 18-month time frame.
With that introduction, let me now get into the details and walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 14% over last year's third quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 19%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to each of the other functional currencies of our major operations mainly in Europe and India.
Our top line growth was driven by higher volumes on a consolidated basis, including significant amounts from our 2012 new product launches as well as favorable sales volumes in Europe and Asia Pacific, which served to more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower pricing throughout the world. In fact, driven by higher volumes and new product introductions, each of the countries in Europe in which we have significant operations, with the exception of Germany, turned in favorable year-over-year constant currency sales growth. 
For the first 9 months of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of 10% over revenues from the first 9 months of 2011, or 14% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion. Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this guidance range as a result of the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, however, we are projecting to be closer to the midpoint of the range.
Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 third quarter at 52% was above our guidance range of 48% to 50% and represented an increase over the same prior year period of nearly 400 basis points. This increase was driven by new product launches and favorable volume and pricing on our EPIPEN auto-injector, partially offset by lower margin on existing products. The current quarter also saw margin improvement from our Indian subsidiary, where sales and gross profit benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 50% as compared to 48% in the prior year. We currently expect to be at the upper end of our gross margin guidance range for the full year.
Adjusted operating income was $513 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 32% increase from Q3 2011 and up 29% from the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increases, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit, was realized in spite of increased levels of investment in both R&D and SG&A. 
R&D expense for the quarter on an adjusted basis was $104 million, or approximately 5.8% of total revenues, and up approximately 51% from the prior year. This increase was mainly a result of ongoing spending with respect to our respiratory and biologics program, including clinical studies. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $324 million for the quarter, or approximately 18% of total revenues, and up approximately 5% over the prior year. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased selling and marketing in our Specialty franchise. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher payroll and related costs as we continue to build out our infrastructure platform in certain targeted areas.
For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $277 million, up 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.5%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be at or slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.
SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, was $964 million, an increase of nearly 10% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $567 million and $1.4 billion for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. We expect to be near the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $1.75 -- of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion for the full year.
Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. 
Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $183 million and is forecasted to be at the low end of the guidance range of $245 million to $265 million for the full year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that we will be at the lower end of this range for the calendar year 2012.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $341 million, or $0.83 a share, a 51% increase from our Q3 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55 per share. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $820 million, or $1.94 per share, a 28% increase over the same prior year period. 
As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS is now $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Our estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release, was approximately $818 million for the year-to-date period and a very strong $469 million for the quarter. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $460 million and $652 million, respectively, and left us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling $366 million. As noted earlier, we are forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion, the high end of our guidance range.
We have been very focused throughout 2012 on operating working capital. On a constant -- on constant currency net sales growth of 19% in the third quarter and 14% through the first 9 months of 2012, we have been able to limit the growth in our operating working capital to approximately 9%, exclusive of FX impacts, as we continue to bring operational efficiencies to our global platform.
Third quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date period to nearly $160 million. And as a result of the timing of planned expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.
As I mentioned before, these updated estimates yield a current free cash flow estimate of $700 million for the year, which is $100 million stronger than our previously communicated expectation as we continue to generate an increasing amount of cash flow from our global platform.
To summarize, our third quarter exceeded even our high expectations and, as anticipated, positions us for a very strong finish to 2012. Our strong track record for organic growth, coupled with the long-term growth drivers which Heather discussed, and our significant financial flexibility all translate into what should be an exciting 2013 and beyond for Mylan. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Maria?"

So Marc, I'll start with the U.S. So I guess I'd like to first start off by saying against our estimates, our U.S. business performed right in line with where we thought it would be. So while we absolutely had a significant amount of launches that we forecasted and projected at the beginning of the year, that '12 would be a great year for our U.S. Generics business. I think that if you look at the timing of the launches throughout the quarters, and some of that pull-through even from launches we had earlier in the year, so all I can tell you is that absolutely performed in line with where we thought it would. We think it still is showing strength in the base business as well as our continued launches that we have for the remainder of the year. So from our perspective, U.S. business, hitting on all cylinders. Europe profitability, I think as we have talked about in the past that we constantly, through this entire macroeconomic situation throughout Europe, have balanced our top and bottom line growth. You've heard me quarter after quarter coming and saying we weren't going to chase the bottom, that there's been irrational behavior and that we would continue to hold steady and control what we can control. So in this period of time, we've done just that. We've continued to increase the profitability around our cost of goods by continuing to vertically integrate and be 100% responsible for our global supply chain. We've continued to make sure that we're structured in the right way with some of the evolving businesses and as they are continuing to change in the different countries. And I think most importantly, and why I wanted to point out in my script, that in all the countries we're doing business, we see an increase in generic conversion. And I think that should be the brightest spot of all because what it shows is that governments very much are beginning to recognize the long-term sustainability that generic utilization brings versus a onetime price cut. So we've seen additional initiatives in Italy, we've seen additional initiatives in France that are bringing those back up. So from my perspective, we certainly have always maintained the need to balance profitable and revenues. I think that our results this quarter are paying off from how we're operating our business in Europe. And lastly, on the Institutional side, in February, we showed our Institutional business being an important strategic growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in that business. We have numerous launches. We're continuing to very much accelerate our own internal R&D pipeline around this businesses globally. So all I can say is that we certainly are continuing to invest and continue to see this as a very important growth driver for us in the future."

In previous conference calls, we've talked about options on the table to enhance shareholder value: share buybacks, bringing down debt, strategic deals. But what I'm hearing from you today is I think a more outspoken commitment or desire to pursue something strategic. And then secondly, I'm very intrigued with the partnership that you signed with Pfizer in Japan, and I'm wondering if you could put some numbers around that, what you see in terms of revenue potential over the next 5 years and what that means to your bottom line? And is this the type of partnership that you see could be replicated in other countries, such as emerging markets where, again, Pfizer doesn't have the AND capabilities that you have and you don't have the feet on the ground that Pfizer has?"

When I -- what I spoke of in my opening remarks was a combination, if you'll remember. I said of us continuing to execute on our existing platform, continuing to execute against the growth drivers we pointed out. And then obviously, the last point was to looking at ways that we're going to use our increased financial flexibility. And I think, as you have seen, that has been a combination, and I think it will continue to be. There's a lot of ways to increase shareholder value, and I think what you can rely on is that we're looking at all of them. And we certainly are looking at any and all compelling acquisitions that would allow us to continue to deliver or accelerate the trajectory that we're already on. I mean, when you look at what we have put out there with our own assets at this time, a 15% CAGR in 2018 is an impressive growth target out there. And I think that as -- this financial flexibility just gives us all that much more ability to accelerate not only that growth but, like I said, in many different ways. As far as Japan goes, look, I think it's an unprecedented deal in our industry. I think it truly does take the core competencies of both of our organizations, and we believe that 1 plus 1 will equal 3-plus. It's about really leveraging the scale and scope and the quality of what we both bring to the table. So while we don't get into putting numbers out there around individual countries, I think you certainly can expect that we believe that this is accretive to our current stand-alone Generics business as well as accretive to their stand-alone Generics business, and that's why the rationale of this deal made all the sense in the world. And I very much believe that it could be a model in other countries where the troops on the ground are important, the brand is important, but having the breadth and the quality of a pipeline is equally as important. And that's where this makes all the sense in the world and very much could make sense in other countries as we move forward."

But I can tell you we're excited about the direction Europe is moving and see that continuing. As far as WELLBUTRIN, look, I think that it's very important to understand that this is a one-off issue and it really does not speak to the generic industry. I will say it speaks to the pharmaceutical industry overall. As you know, from time to time, as FDA continues to gather data and look at data, there are times where they've taken brand products off the market as well as changing guidelines and changing specs. So this is something that's constantly going on within the FDA in looking and working with companies. I think in this particular instance, it was certainly related to patient safety. FDA made a judgment call years ago around the 300 milligram. And when -- the data today that they're looking at has caused them to get to a different place. Certainly, we don't see this impacting our product and believe this was certainly in relation to just one in particular formulation. So I would tell you that our industry is alive and well, and I don't really see this having any impact on that whatsoever. Thank you."

I'm assuming that you don't agree with that, but maybe you can just sort of comment a little bit on sort of their observations. And then with Watson now having obtained approval, still some ambiguity around the issue of exclusivity. The FDA made it very clear in the approval letter that Watson did not obtain approval within 30 months but did not actually make a decision on exclusivity. You said previously that you still thought generic Lidoderm was a possibility in terms of your ability to launch in 2013, and I'm just wondering if you still believe that to be the case based on anything new that's happening at the FDA with regard to the application and then based on the Watson approval."

I think when you look at Endo trying to stress that based on their experience and expertise in this development, this is not their product. They have end-licensed it. So I think to talk about what kind of science is out there and who has the capability, I can assure you we are manufacturing and developing our own product, and I believe we do have the expertise and the track record with FDA to know and to be able to guide you guys, as we have been, about what we're capable of doing. So I -- that's what I would say about Endo's comments. And we absolutely continue to see this as a possible opportunity in the second half of the year. As you know, FDA historically doesn't make exclusivity decisions until they have to.
