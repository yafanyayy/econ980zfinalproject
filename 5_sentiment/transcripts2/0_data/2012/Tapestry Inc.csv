As noted in our release this morning, we are very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the stress of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platforms and our multichannel international distribution model. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation. In addition, we make continued progress against our key global business initiatives including expanding our share in the growing North America and bag and accessory market, increasing our international presence, leveraging our heritage in the men's business and expanding our digital presence. These experience strong response to our new collections and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well-situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. While I will get into more detail about the  outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. One key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 18% to $1.18 compared with $1 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.45 billion versus $1.26 billion a year ago, an increase of 15% ; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85 percent of total sales rose 17%  to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.8%  from prior year while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 6% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth with significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 5 retail stores and 5 factory stores in North America including 2 men's retail stores and 1 men's factory store. Thus, the end of the period, we have 350 full-priced and 157 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. 6 locations were opened including 4 men's locations. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan with 22 full priced stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 33 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. And in China, we added 9 locations, 8 in the Mainland and 1 in Hong Kong our flagship, which I might add is doing very well. At the end of the quarter, there were 80 Coach locations in China, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 65 locations on the Mainland in 28 cities. As we discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores. And direct sales, we're even with prior year on a comparable basis at $166 million. Results reflected shipment timing differences from prior year in our international wholesale businesses. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased at a double-digit pace, while sales at POS and U.S. Department stores were even with last year's holiday quarter. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increased it experienced in the preceding 9 months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's women's handbag and accessory sales rose about 12% across all channels in North America during those recent quarters. In our direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 15%. Separately, it's worth noting that we saw modest improvement in our customers' outlook to the economy compared to a quarter ago with about 60% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 48%. Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong with our 2/3 of consumer survey noting that probably or definitely will purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenue in North America rose 15% with our directly operated businesses up 17% driven by 8.8% in chain store sales increases in the distribution. As noted in our press release, all direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy expanding our own website, mobile platform and social media, which enable customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. Mike will provide additional details around some of these initiatives in just a moment. Building this overall strong comp research with similar gains in both the store channel driven by conversion and average transaction size and continued strength in our e-commerce business. Overall retail traffic rose with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters while traffic on coach.com continues to gain momentum. As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose again sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the comps with this is really generating in an extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Consistent with our strategy of building brand awareness in China, we took a number of important steps during the second quarter. First, we've launched an integrated campaign with our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow that is advertising across print, outdoor and the web, as well as the 70th anniversary gala dinner and gallery event in Beijing. Another key component of the campaign with the successful launch of our presence [indiscernible] the leading social network insight in China. In December, we also became the first U.S. incorporated company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. All of these events helped to drive increased awareness for our brand. While Jane will get into more detail on our financials, and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Clearly, our balanced and more defined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America. There were 3 important productivity drivers within our North American business: overall product performance, our digital strategy and coach.com results and continued progress on our new men's initiative. During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness ensuring that we have is that these flow of product throughout the period. Our strategy to flow more product later in the quarter versus previous seasons was also very successful. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our new holiday ad campaign was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail was also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Also new to Madison were the Mini Sophia, the flat carryall and the Caroline Satchel. This was our most fully developed Madison offering, and we saw the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago. For November, Poppy was the focus offered in new styles, including 2 totes, a foldover cross-body silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. [indiscernible] soft patent lightweight fabric would diamond among quilting and chain straps add additional excitement and vibrant color to the collection. We also added some newness to Chelsea, only introduced last fall with the classic tote featuring chain detail at compelling price points. Right before Thanksgiving, we refreshed our offering with updates to Madison and Kristin along with the new drawstring tote in Chelsea giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Our mid-December significant Madison refresh also delivered newness closer to our peak selling period. Of course, we also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts from iPad covers to wristlets and a wide range of items under $100. Our holiday product were supported by comprehensive marketing plan, which began in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing was product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign spanned coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing. Our addition of digital media to select high-profile store windows was a new element of our in-store marketing and was very well-received. Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. Just lastly, we launched an updated Poppy collection with the fresh point of view with several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and the Poppy which harken back to classic Lewis bag of the '90s. We also introduced the fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, the focus will be on Kristin for new stuff across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept and soft feminine colors. On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introduction with key styles offered at great prices. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As you know, from previous calls, our digital objective in North America is to drive traffic and build brand awareness, while maximizing e-commerce opportunities. Some of our key online initiatives are: first, mobile commerce. We launched our mobile commerce platform this past May now almost 20% of our web traffic came through a mobile device this holiday season. Second, social media, with over 2.7 million Coach fans on Facebook, this social platform continues to evolve in its contribution to our overall brand message and success. Facebook provides us with additional marketing and potential revenue opportunities as we continue to learn how to engage with our customer in this space. Third, factory online. As mentioned and in our last call in the U.S., we introduced our invitation only flash sale site targeted only towards our most loyal factory exclusive costumer consumer. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online while enjoying the same product value found in our stores. We're quite pleased with the results of this highly profitable initiative. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, clearly the Internet will continue to increase in importance globally as both the marketing and communication vehicle and a sales driver. We now have a web presence in 20 countries, 3 of which are commerce-enabled, and we welcome several million visitors outside of North America in the quarter. In China, we're continuing to develop our digital program and capabilities, which include the launch of e-commerce. Additionally, as we go our international database, we're problematically communicating with our international consumers, in e-mail and seeing engagement at the levels we enjoy here in the U.S. We believe in digital and are clearly recognizing the benefits of this growth vehicle. Our intent is to drive further innovation in this channel both in the near and long-term. As we mentioned in our press release, we're also really excited about the results we're achieving in our men's business, which is on track to double again in fiscal year '12 to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shop, dual-gender locations and expanded assortment in existing stores, and across all geographies and channels. In North America, we see men's both -- as both the way to drive profitability productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. We believe that in this fragmented category where there's no dominant player, Coach has the opportunity to become the market leader. Our approach to growing men's is to create great product, presented in exciting format combined with the rigor that we use to understand our consumer and is buying preferences. We also believe based in our survey is beyond simply taking share, we will actually grow the men's category in North America. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity in our men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season given current sales trends in our Retail businesses. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth.

As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies. First, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the growing men's accessory category",712,"Thanks, Mike. As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies. First, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the growing men's accessory category. Before we emerge as the global business driver and was also mentioned by Mike and that is to leveraging the growing power of this digital world. Focused digital initiatives are unimportant and effect of complementarity strategy to our distribution growth as we continue to grow our store base in North America and worldwide. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 14% this year compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores for this year including the 21 opened in the first half. The FY '12 opening includes about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets with about half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% to 11% this year driven by men's. 
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or at least an additional 15 for the balance of the fiscal year with the vast majority on the Mainland. Virtually, all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we remain confident that we will achieve at least $300 million in sales during the current fiscal year. In Japan, spending has remained stable after the first 2 quarters of volatility in the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share notably in the men's business. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan or an additional 7 net new stores for the balance of the year, nearly all of them dedicated men's locations. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, at the beginning of this month, we successfully transitioned our Domestic Retail businesses in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of the Singapore business last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of the Malaysian Domestic Retail operation next July. It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asian distribution center. In addition, we find these stores experience a significant improvement and productivity when they become directly manage, as we control the total brand experience. Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. We're also pleased to announce other distribution agreements in Latin America. Initially, including Columbia, Venezuela, Panama and Chile and to Indonesia with the first store openings next year. 
Touching on Europe. We are building a foundation for long-term growth. First in the U.K., we are beginning to build our multichannel model. Today, we have 3 stores all opened in the last 12 months, including a mall store in Westfield, our new Bond Street flagship and a factory store. We will be opening our second London flagship in Regent Street this spring. Importantly, we are gaining traction in this market is the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and a majority of our business is coming from local customers. 
And second in France where we have partnered with French company, our Key Boulevard health and women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist as we continue to grow our brand awareness with the region shopper. In closing, we're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our business at a double-digit pace. At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,146112863,209686,"Coach, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 85% of our business was up 17%, and our Indirect business was even with last year as the shipment timing into international wholesale account. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $1.18 as compared to $1 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $347 million from $303 million. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $521 million in the second quarter, up 15% from $453 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36% compared to 35.9% in the year-ago period. 
In the second quarter, gross profit rose 14% to $1.05 billion, up from $915 million a year ago and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.2% compared to 72.4% the prior year. As expected, we showed a continued sequential improvement in the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved in the prior year level in the second quarter and represented 36.2% of sales versus 36.5%. As mentioned in our press release, during the second quarter, we recorded certain items. They included the onetime effect of a re-evaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in the Japanese corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multiyear FICA agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased our tax provision by $12 million. As a result, we made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, increasing SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the effect of the one-time tax benefit to net income and earnings per share. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory at quarter end were $429 million, up 17% from the end of last year Q2 and consistent with our sales growth. This inventory level allow us to support 31 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations at Coach Japan and 23 additional Coach China stores from a year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this spring.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion as compared with $940 million a year ago despite repurchases of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $5.48, spending a total of $300 million, taking of our first half total to about $360 million. At the end of the quarter, about $600 million remained on our current repurchase authorization. 
Next half from operating opportunities and activities in the second quarter were $604 million compared to $408 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $555 million versus $382 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $39 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well-positioned for the rest of the fiscal year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales growth with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp sales in North America for the second half of the fiscal year. Second, as we said before, we expect our second half gross margins to improve over last year as we anniversary increased stores and comp. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin of FY '12 will be essentially level with the prior year. First, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years at about 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to add to Lew's earlier word. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gain for the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. Thank you for participating in our conference call today and now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I joined by Jerry Stritzke and the Victor Luis will take some questions to be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

They are great learning platforms for us, and the performance in those stores are excellent. The larger opportunity that we see is actually expanding our men's business in existing retail locations through shop-in-shops, what we call concept shops, and in fact, selling more men's products in all stores globally. We're doing this through increased presentations to actually selling our product via our website, enabled in-store through laptops versus very broad opportunity for us to sell more product in men's. Where I see us going in Father's Day is several new men's shops will be installed this spring. The opening of our Pentagon dual-gender location, which will happen in May. That's a women's and men's side-by-side location. And as we enter FY '13, a significant rollout of Coach men shops in existing retail locations. So where we see the growth is driving productivity in our existing stores, taking advantage of the men's momentum that we're seeing to CBSR, our Coach By Special Request Program, as well as growing freestanding men's store. Victor, if you want to add a little bit on the global side what we're doing in Asia?"

When you look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion.

When you look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% or $12 billion market. Of that, Japan is approximately $4.4 billion, China at the $3.2 billion, including Hong Kong and Macao, including duty-free and then the rest in the rest of Asia. Japan, the men's penetration is about 25%, and we're still very much any roll off stage. Today, we have 14 dedicated men's locations, 7 in Full Price, 7 in Factory. As many of you know, most of our distribution in Japan is within department stores where we are on the women's handbag store and there the opportunity will be to increase distribution with the men's floors, which we are now commencing, and initial results have been quite promising. China is really a massive opportunity for us. When we look at Mainland China, many of our competitor brands, men's represents 50% or more of your sales. And there, our 65 Mainland China location today, 28 of them are dual-gender locations where we have basically stand-alone men's presences. Of the 30 locations, we are opening this fiscal year, practically all of them will be dual-gender locations, so we're starting very early stages as basically a global men's and women's brands. And we are seeing truly terrific results with very early stages, 25% to 30% penetration for men's in these locations at a point where we really still don't have an awareness as the men's brand. As many of you know in the past, we've discussed our brand awareness, our unaided brand awareness at 16% off from 8% last year and we're really just starting in the men's space. So to achieve this penetration this early, it's truly exciting and bodes well for the future. And in the rest of Asia, we're still at our very early stages. We have, of course, as Lew and back our Singapore business and Taiwan only a few weeks ago and there we are committing the menstrual out as well, and we expect to see similar penetrations to what we're seeing and China and the medium term in the next 2 to 3 years."

It's obviously a big marketing opportunity for us, and you will see us just starting a good portion of our marketing globally both on the Internet and in traditional media, as well as social networking both men to build awareness and to encourage gifting. And in terms of existing consumers versus the consumers, we are in North America attracting a higher rate of new customers into the franchise through men's than we are women's. But should be expected because the women's business is of course extremely developed with the growth opportunities ahead within the men's early days. Just in terms of distribution growth versus same-store sales growth with our growth than being proportion not to provide much detail. But I would say is that we are achieving significant double-digit same-store growth in the men's area."

And what the understand is that the concept is prudent. You have enough exposure in the marketplace and enough experience with consumers and those are the concept is that the very proven concept and the category is very real. We need a little more time to very tactically break out the opportunity from a distribution standpoint. Our digital opportunity with our men's website, our global opportunity in terms of store footprint both the existing opportunity in large-format flagship stores to add men. Then you opportunity to develop men and women to dual-gender stores and how we can provide a men's presence in all stores where we trade at currently women stores do something we need to sort out. So we need to really work through the entire fleet in Full Price in North America in over the 350 stores. We're doing that work today, and we have traction in each of the formats, which gives us the faster growth. On the product side, what's interesting is that as we expand this category. It's not all about bag. Bags is still the anchor, but we're seeing very strong response to accessory, to lifestyle category, to emerging category by footwear, outerwear, small travel pieces. But we believe that this concept hangs very well on its own and drive very strong productivity metrics comparable to our women's business in terms of ticket size and from a margin structure very comparable as well.

We are, as Lew mentioned on his opening remarks today, 80 doors with the vast majority of those 65 on the Mainland. When we look at the opportunity, it is truly boundless. And, Barbara, you know well the social demographics with the economics of the market, 1.3 billion population of which 50% this urban and continuing to urbanize, already 120 cities with the population of 1 million or more. We are today only in 28 of those cities and with our broad collection from a style perspective, as well as our broad price points, we're able to much more easily than traditional luxury brands of course to go into the second- and third-tier cities where we're seeing success. Of course, we are posting a rapidly growing middle-class, and we're not seeing many limitations from a distribution perspective. When we stop looking at Coach's strategy towards multichannel rollout, China really fits nicely. We have approximately 600 apartment store doors today in China. Of which, over 110, 120 are doing incredibly well in the imported luxury cosmetics space, which serve as the barometer for us. Malls are continuing to develop nicely, both in the Full Price, as well now I'm increasing rollout of factory outlet malls of course which we know well. Looking at the rollout for this year as we've announced 30 doors, and we see us continuing at that pace for the foreseeable future. I think the second question was on products. And there we really don't see a tremendous difference globally quite frankly in terms of our collection. Madison, Poppy, Kristin are truly global collections for us. The difference and what truly differentiates Coach for many of our competitors is that we have a group of very talented merchants in each of our markets. We're supported by a truly a superb customer insight team. We're constantly listening to our consumers and that allow us to tweak our collections whether it will be from color, size, shape, style, and therefore, maximize the opportunity in each of our markets. But the difference is I touched to earlier, of course, in China is that really the men's opportunity. And we're starting out from the beginning in this very early stages as a dual-gender brand. Whereas we have been 3, 4 years earlier opening 1,000 to 1,500 square feet location that were basically women's only location. Today, we're targeting 2,000 to 2,500 square feet on average locations with the men's and women's entrance in most cases and getting truly terrific results in seeing our product resonates even though we still have very low awareness levels at these early days. Touching on duty-free. And specifically, we're looking at I will say to parts of the travel retail piece. Of course for China, the big opportunity if outside of China approximately half of Chinese luxury sales occur outside of China. We're very active in this developing our distribution and Asia, and we're seeing tremendous benefit from that of course within China itself in Hong Kong and Macau and beginning to see some of that in other markets as well. But in China domestically at the airports, there will be opportunities both in the duty space, as well as in the duty-free space is that the airport authorities begin to put the infrastructure in place. It's something we're investigating. We haven't made any move in that space at the moment because there's so much opportunity in the urban areas themselves that we're going after, but it this something that we're paying attention to."

And as we said, the consumers are more encouraged at any point than they have in the last 6 to 12 months. So we feel, barring any unexpected event, that the consumer sentiment will continue to be positive. Obviously, the recovery is very uneven. While unemployment is still at a terribly high rate of 8.5%, unemployment for college graduates over the age of 25 ways our primary consumer is only in the mid-4 range.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2012 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from U.S. Retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Victor Luis, our President of International Retail. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments. 
I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO."

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the strength of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platform and our multichannel international distribution model. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our key global business initiatives, including expanding our share in the growing North American bag and accessory market, increasing our international presence, leveraging our heritage in the men's business and expanding our digital presence. We've experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. 
While I will get into more detail about the  outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 18% to $1.18 compared with $1 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.45 billion versus $1.26 billion a year ago, an increase of 15%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85%  of total sales, rose 17% to $1.3 billion from $1.3 -- from $1.1 billion the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.8% from prior year while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 6% in dollars; and finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 5 Retail stores and 5 Factory stores in North America, including 2 men's Retail stores and 1 men's Factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 Full Price and 157 Factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. Six locations were opened, including 4 men's locations. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan with 22 Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 33 Factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel Retail locations. 
And in China, we added 9 locations: 8 in the mainland and 1 in Hong Kong, our Nathan Road flagship, which I might add is doing very well. At the end of the quarter, there were 80 Coach locations in China, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 65 locations on the mainland in 28 cities. As we discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, Retail stores, shop-in-shops and Factory stores. 
Indirect sales were even with prior year on a comparable basis at $166 million. Results reflected shipment timing differences from prior year in our international wholesale businesses. Sales for the quarter at Retail and international wholesale locations increased at a double-digit pace, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores were even with last year's holiday quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding 9 months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's women's handbag and accessory sales rose about 12% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 15%. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we saw modest improvement in our customers' outlook to the economy compared to a quarter ago, with about 60% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 48%. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with our 2/3 of consumer survey noting they'd probably or definitely will purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 15%, with our Directly operated businesses up 17% driven by 8.8% in same-store sales increases in new distribution. As noted in our press release, all direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brands. Mike will provide additional details around some of these initiatives in just a moment. 
Fueling this overall strong comp results was similar gains in both store channels, driven by conversion and average transaction size and continued strength in our e-commerce business. Overall Retail traffic rose, with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters while traffic on coach.com continues to gain momentum. 
As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose again sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the excellent comps we consistently generated and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of building brand awareness in China, we took a number of important steps during the second quarter. First, we launched an integrated marketing campaign with our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, that included advertising across print, outdoor and the web, as well as the 70th anniversary gala dinner and gallery event in Beijing. Another key components of the campaign were the successful launch of our presence on Sina Weibo, the leading social networking site in China. In December, we also became the first U.S. incorporated company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
All of these events helped to drive increased awareness for our brands. While Jane will into more detail on our financials, and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America. There were 3 important productivity drivers within our North American business: overall product performance, our digital strategy and coach.com results and continued progress on our new men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. Our strategy to flow more product later in the quarter versus previous seasons was also very successful. 
To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail was also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Also new to Madison were the Mini Sophia, the flap carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. This was our most fully developed Madison offering, and we saw the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago. 
For November, Poppy was the focus, offered in new styles, including 2 totes, a foldover cross-body silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss, a soft patent, lightweight fabric with diamond quilting and chain straps brought additional excitement and vibrant color to the collection. We also added some newness to Chelsea, only introduced last fall, with a classic tote featuring chain details at compelling price points. 
Right before Thanksgiving, we refreshed our offering with updates to Madison and Kristin, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday seasons. Our mid-December significant Madison refresh also delivered newness closer to our peak selling period. 
Of course, we also had a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wristlets and a wide range of items under $100. Our holiday product was supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, which began in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing was product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign spanned coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing. Our addition of digital media to select high-profile store windows was a new element to our in-store marketing and was very well-received. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. Just last week, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view with several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and the Poppy willis, which harkens back to classic willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, the focus will be on Kristin with 4 new styles across multiple fabrications and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft feminine colors. 
On the Factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introduction with the key styles offered at great prices. Our products' assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As you know from previous calls, our digital objective in North America is to drive traffic and build brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunities. Some of our key online initiatives are, first, mobile commerce. We launched our mobile commerce platform this past May, and almost 20% of our web traffic came through a mobile device this holiday seasons. 
Second, social media. With over 2.7 million Coach fans on Facebook, this social platform continues to evolve in its contribution to our overall brand message and success. Facebook provides us with additional marketing and potential revenue opportunities as we continue to learn how to engage with our customer in this space. 
Third, Factory online. As mentioned in our last call, in the U.S., we introduced our invitation-only flash-sale site, targeted only towards our most loyal Factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online while enjoying the same product and value that's found in our stores. We're quite pleased with the results of these highly profitable initiatives. Well, this is a snapshot of our North American Retail digital initiatives. 
Clearly, the Internet will continue to increase in importance globally, as both a marketing and communication vehicle and a sales driver. We now have a web presence in 20 countries, 3 of which are commerce-enabled, and we welcome several million visitors outside of North America in the quarter. In China, we're continuing to develop our digital programs and capabilities, which include a planned launch of e-commerce. Additionally, as we grow our international database, we're programmatically communicating with our international consumers in e-mail and seeing engagement at the levels we enjoy here in the U.S. We believe in digital and are clearly recognizing the benefits of this growth vehicle. Our intent is to drive further innovation in this channel, both in the near and long term. 
As we mentioned in our press release, we're also really excited about the results we're achieving in our men's business, which is on track to double again in fiscal year '12 to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. 
In North America, we see men's both -- as both the way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. We believe that in this fragmented category, where there's no dominant player, Coach has the opportunity to become the market leader. Our approach to growing men's is to create great product, presented in exciting format, combined with the rigor that we use to understand our consumer and his buying preferences. We also believe, based on our survey, that beyond simply taking share, we will actually grow the men's category in North America. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our men's initiatives. We're feeling great about the spring season, given the current sales trends in our Retail businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the largely growing men's accessory category. A fourth has emerge as the global business driver and was also mentioned by Mike, and that is leveraging the growing power of the digital world. 
Coach's digital initiatives are an important and effective complementary strategy to our distribution growth as we continue to grow our store base in North America and worldwide. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 14% this year compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores for this year, including the 21 opened in the first half. The FY '12 opening includes about 15 Full Price and 25 Factory outlets, with about half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% to 11% this year driven by men's. 
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or, at least, an additional 15 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we remain confident that we will achieve at least $300 million in sales during the current fiscal year. 
In Japan, spending has remained stable after the first 2 quarters of volatility in the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, notably in the men's business. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan or an additional 7 net new stores for the balance of the year, nearly all of them dedicated men's locations. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, at the beginning of this month, we successfully transitioned our Domestic Retail businesses in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at Retail to the Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of the Singapore business last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of the Malaysia Domestic Retail operations next July. It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asian distribution center. In addition, we find that these stores experience a significant improvement and productivity when they become directly manage, as we control the total brand experience. 
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. We're also pleased to announce other distribution agreements for Latin America and initially including Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Chile and to Indonesia where the first store's opening next year. 
Touching on Europe. We are building a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we are beginning to build our multichannel model. Today, we have 3 stores, all opened in the last 12 months, including a mall store in Westfield, our new Bond Street flagship and a Factory store. We will be opening our second London flagship on Regent Street this spring. Importantly, we are gaining traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and a majority of our business is coming from local customers. And second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist, as we continue to grow our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. 
In closing, we're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our business at a double-digit pace. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,146112863,209866,"Coach, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have taken you through the highlights and strategy. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which rep",884,"Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have taken you through the highlights and strategy. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 17%, and our Indirect business was even with last year due to shipment timing and to international wholesale account. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $1.18 as compared to $1 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $347 million from $303 million. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $521 million in the second quarter, up 15% from $453 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36% compared to 35.9% in the year-ago period. In the second quarter, gross profit rose 14% to $1.05 billion, up from $915 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.2% compared to 72.4% the prior year. As expected, we showed a continued sequential improvement in the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from the prior year level in the second quarter and represented 36.2% of sales versus 36.5%. 
As mentioned in our press release, during the second quarter, we recorded certain items. They included the onetime effect of a reevaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in the Japanese corporate tax laws and a favorable completion of a multiyear pricing agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased our tax provision by $12 million. As a result, we made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, increasing SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the effect of the onetime tax benefit to net income and earnings per share. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory at quarter-end were $429 million, up 17% from the end of last year's Q2 and consistent with our sales growth. This inventory level allow us to support 31 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations at Coach Japan and 23 additional Coach China stores from a year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this spring.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion as compared with $940 million a year ago, despite repurchases of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $62.48, spending a total of $300 million, taking of our first half total to about $360 million. At the end of the quarter, about $600 million remained on our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating opportunities -- activities in the second quarter was $604 million compared to $408 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $555 million versus $382 million in the same period last year. 
Our CapEx spending was $39 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the rest of the fiscal year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales growth with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid single-digit comp sales in North America for the second half of the fiscal year. Second, as we said before, we expect our second half gross margin to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be essentially level with prior year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years, at about 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over for the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions to be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

For Coach with our sales expected as -- men's sales expected at $400 million, that will represent about 8% of our overall sales for this fiscal year. We believe on -- that we can very comfortably get to our rightful share of, at least, 15% off a larger business over the next few years.

And I think what we planned to do with the investor community is share a very detailed global view of our approach to men's expansion for FY '13. But let me give you some grounding and some headlines on what we're doing. First, we're very pleased with the results of our freestanding men's stores. There are handful of them out there. They are great learning platforms for us, and the performance in those stores is excellent. The larger opportunity that we see is actually expanding our men's business in existing Retail locations through shop-in-shops, what we call, concept shops and, in fact, selling more men's products in all stores globally. We're doing this through increased presentations through actually selling our product via our website, enabled in-store through laptops. There's a very broad opportunity for us to sell more product in men's. Where I see us going in Father's Day is several new men's shops which will be installed this spring. The opening of our Pentagon dual-gender location, which will happen in May. That's a women's and men's side-by-side location. And as we enter FY '13, a significant rollout of men's shops in existing Retail locations. So where we see the growth is driving productivity in our existing stores, taking advantage of the men's momentum that we're seeing through CBSR, our Coach By Special Request program, as well as growing freestanding men's stores. Victor, if you want to add little bit on the global side, what we're doing in Asia?"

When we look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billio",388,"Sure. When we look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billion market. Of that, Japan is approximately $4.4 billion, China at $3.2 billion, including Hong Kong, Macau, including duty-free and then the rest in -- the rest of Asia. Japan, the men's penetration is at about 25%, and we're still very much in a rollout stage. Today, we have 14 dedicated men's locations, 7 in Full Price, 7 in Factory. As many of you know, most of our distribution in Japan is within department stores where we are on the women's handbag floor, and there, the opportunity will be to increase distribution with the men's floors, which we are now commencing. And initial results have been quite promising. China is really a massive opportunity for us. When we look at mainland China, many of our competitor brands, men's represent 50% or more of their sales. And there, of our 65 mainland China location today, 28 of them are dual-gender locations, where we have, basically, stand-alone men's presences. Of the 30 locations we are opening this fiscal year, practically all of them will be dual-gender locations. So we're starting with -- very early stages, as basically a global men's and women's brand. And we are seeing truly terrific results with very early stages, 25% to 30% penetration for men's in these locations, at a point where we really still don't have an awareness as a men's brand. As many of you know, in the past, we've discussed our brand awareness, our unaided brand awareness at 16%, up from 8% last year, and we're really just starting in the men's space. So to achieve this penetration this early, it's truly exciting and bodes well for the future. And in the rest of Asia, we're still at our very early stages. We have, of course, as Lew announced, just taken back our Singapore business and Taiwan only a few weeks ago. And there, we are commencing the men's rollout as well, and that -- and expect to see similar penetrations to what we're seeing in China in the medium term, in the next 2 to 3 years."

At present, I would say it's -- in North America, a slightly greater proportion of men's is for gift than self purchased. We have to make self-purchase. Among women -- I'm sorry. Gifting for women is about 20% of our sales. I would estimate men's might be 30%. It's obviously a big marketing opportunity for us, and you'll see us just starting a good portion of our marketing globally, both on the Internet and in traditional media, as well as social networking towards men's to both build awareness and to encourage gifting. And in terms of existing consumers versus new consumers, we are, in North America, attracting a higher rate of new customers into the franchise through men's than we are women's. But that's just the expected because the women's business is, of course, extremely developed with growth opportunities ahead. But in men's, it's early days. In terms of distribution growth versus same-store sales growth, what I -- I am being cautioned not to provide much detail. What I would say is that we are achieving significant double-digit same-store growth in the men's area."

You have enough exposure in the marketplace and enough experience with consumers to know that the concept is a very proven concept and the category is very real. We need a little more time to very tactically break out the opportunity from a distribution standpoint: our digital opportunity with our men's website; our global opportunity in terms of store footprint, both the existing opportunity in large-format flagship stores to add men; the new opportunity to develop men's and women's dual-gender stores; and how we can provide a men's presence in all stores where we trade that our currently women's stores is something we need to sort out. So we need to really work through the entire fleet in Full Price in North America alone. That's 350 stores. We're doing that work today, and we have traction in each of the formats, which gives us the path for growth. On the product side, what's interesting is that as we expand this category. It's not all about bags. Bag is still the anchor, but we're seeing very strong response to accessory, to lifestyle category, to emerging categories like by footwear, outerwear, small travel pieces. So we believe that this concept hangs very well on its own and drive very strong productivity metrics comparable to our women's business in terms of ticket size and, from a margin structure very, comparable as well."

We are, as Lew mentioned in his opening remarks today, 80 doors with the vast majority of those 65 on the mainland. When we look at the opportunity, it is truly boundless. And, Barbara, you know well the socio-demographic, socio-economics of the market, 1.3 billion population of which 50% is urban and continuing to urbanize, already 120 cities with the population of 1 million or more. We are today only in 28 of those cities. And with our broad collection from a style perspective, as well as our broad price points, we're able to much more easily than traditional luxury brands, of course, to go into the second- and third-tier cities where we're seeing success. Of course, we are also seeing a rapidly growing middle-class, and we're not seeing many limitations from a distribution perspective. When we stop looking at Coach's strategy towards a multichannel -- towards multichannel rollout, China really fits nicely. We have approximately 600 department store doors today in China. Of which, already over 110, 120 are doing incredibly well in the imported luxury cosmetics space, which serves as the barometer for us. Malls are continuing to develop nicely, both in the Full Price, as well now an increasing rollout of Factory outlet malls, of course, which we know well. Looking at the rollout for this year, as we've announced, 30 doors, and we see us continuing at that pace for the foreseeable future. I think the second question was on products, and there, we really don't see a tremendous difference globally, quite frankly, in terms of our collection. Madison, Poppy, Kristin are truly global collections for us. The difference and what truly differentiates Coach from many of our competitors is that we have a group of very talented merchants in each of our markets. We're supported by a truly -- a superb customer-insight team. We're constantly listening to our consumers, and that allow us to tweak our collections, whether it be from color, size, shape, style, and, therefore, maximize the opportunity in each of our markets. But the difference, as I touched to earlier, of course, in China is really the men's opportunity, and we're starting out from the beginning in these very early stages as a dual-gender brand. Whereas we have been 3, 4 years earlier opening 1,000 to 1,500 square feet location that were basically women's only location. Today, we're targeting 2,000 to 2,500 square feet on average locations with a men's and women's entrance in most cases and getting truly terrific results in seeing our product resonate, even though we still have very low awareness levels at these early days. Touching on duty-free, and specifically, we're looking at, I would say, 2 parts of the travel Retail piece. Of course, for China, the big opportunity is, outside of China, approximately half of Chinese luxury sales occur outside of China. We're very active in this, developing our distribution in Asia, and we're seeing tremendous benefits from that, of course, within China itself in Hong Kong and Macau and beginning to see some of that in other markets as well. But in China domestically at the airports, there will be opportunities, both in the duty paid, as well as in the duty-free spaces as airport authorities begin to put the infrastructure in place. It's something we're investigating. We haven't made a move in that space at the moment because there's so much opportunity in the urban areas themselves that we're going after, but it is something that we're paying attention to."

While unemployment is still at a terribly high rate of 8.5%, unemployment for college graduates over the age of 25, who is our primary consumer, is only in the mid-4 range.

Before we begin, we must point out this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the strength of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platform and our multichannel international distribution model. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our key global business initiatives, including expanding our share in the growing North American bag and accessory market, increasing our international presence, leveraging our heritage in the men's business and expanding our digital presence. We've experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. 
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 18% to $1.18 compared with $1 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.45 billion versus $1.26 billion a year ago, an increase of 15%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, rose 17% to $1.3 billion from $1.3 -- from $1.1 billion in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.8% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 6% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth with significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 5 Retail stores and 5 Factory stores in North America, including 2 men's Retail stores and 1 men's Factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 Full Price and 157 Factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. Six locations were opened, including 4 men's locations. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan with 22 Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 33 Factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel Retail locations. 
And in China, we added 9 locations: 8 in the mainland and 1 in Hong Kong, our Nathan Road flagship, which, I might add, is doing very well. At the end of the quarter, there were 80 Coach locations in China, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 65 locations on the mainland in 28 cities. As we discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, Retail stores, shop-in-shops and Factory stores. 
Indirect sales were even with prior year on a comparable basis at $166 million. Results reflected shipment timing differences from prior year in our international wholesale businesses. Sales for the quarter at Retail and international wholesale locations increased at a double-digit pace, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores were even with last year's holiday quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding 9 months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's women's handbag and accessory sales rose about 12% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 15%. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we saw modest improvement in our customers' outlook to the economy compared to a quarter ago, with about 60% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 48%. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with about 2/3 of consumer surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 15%, with our directly operated businesses up 17%, driven by 8.8% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. As noted in our press release, all direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brands. Mike will provide additional details around some of these initiatives in just a moment. 
Fueling these overall strong comp results were similar gains in both store channels, driven by conversion and average transaction size, and continued strength in our e-commerce business. Overall Retail traffic rose with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters, while traffic on coach.com continues to gain momentum. 
As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose again sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the excellent comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of building brand awareness in China, we took a number of important steps during the second quarter. First, we launched an integrated marketing campaign with our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, that included advertising across print, outdoor and the web, as well as the 70th anniversary gala dinner and gallery event in Beijing. Another key components of the campaign were the successful launch of our presence on Sina Weibo, the leading social networking site in China. In December, we also became the first U.S. incorporated company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
All of these events helped to drive increased awareness for our brands. While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America. There were 3 important productivity drivers within our North American business: overall product performance, our digital strategy and coach.com results and continued progress on our new men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. Our strategy to flow more product later in the quarter versus previous seasons was also very successful. 
To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail was also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Also new to Madison were the Mini Sophia, the flap carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. This was our most fully developed Madison offering, and we saw the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago. 
For November, Poppy was the focus, offered in new styles, including 2 totes, a foldover cross-body silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss, a soft patent, lightweight fabric with diamond quilting and chain straps brought additional excitement and vibrant color to the collection. We also added some newness to Chelsea, only introduced last fall, with a classic tote featuring chain details at compelling price points. 
Right before Thanksgiving, we refreshed our offering with updates to Madison and Kristin, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday seasons. Our mid-December significant Madison refresh also delivered newness closer to our peak selling period. 
Of course, we also had a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wristlets, and a wide range of items under $100. Our holiday product was supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, which began in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing was product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign spanned coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing. Our addition of digital media to select high-profile store windows was a new element to our in-store marketing and was very well-received. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. Just last week, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view with several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and the Poppy Willis, which harkens back to classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, the focus will be on Kristin, with 4 new styles across multiple fabrications and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft feminine colors. 
On the Factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introduction with key styles offered at great prices. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As you know from previous calls, our digital objective in North America is to drive traffic and build brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunities. Some of our key online initiatives are, first, mobile commerce. We launched our mobile commerce platform this past May, and almost 20% of our web traffic came through a mobile device this holiday season. 
Second, social media. With over 2.7 million Coach fans on Facebook, this social platform continues to evolve in its contribution to our overall brand message and success. Facebook provides us with additional marketing and potential revenue opportunities as we continue to learn how to engage with our customer in this space. 
Third, Factory online. As mentioned in our last call, in the U.S., we introduced our invitation-only flash-sale site, targeted only towards our most loyal Factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online while enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores. We're quite pleased with the results of this highly profitable initiative. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American Retail digital initiatives, clearly, the Internet will continue to increase in importance globally as both a marketing and communication vehicle and a sales driver. We now have a web presence in 20 countries, 3 of which are commerce-enabled, and we welcome several million visitors outside of North America in the quarter. In China, we're continuing to develop our digital programs and capabilities, which include a planned launch of e-commerce. Additionally, as we grow our international database, we're programmatically communicating with our international consumers via e-mail and seeing engagement at the levels we enjoy here in the U.S. We believe in digital and are clearly recognizing the benefits of this growth vehicle. Our intent is to drive further innovation in this channel, both in the near and long term. 
As we mentioned in our press release, we're also really excited about the results we're achieving in our men's business, which is on track to double again in fiscal year '12 to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. 
In North America, we see men's both -- as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. We believe that in this fragmented category where there's no dominant player, Coach has the opportunity to become the market leader. Our approach to growing men's is to create great product, present it in exciting formats, combined with the rigor that we use to understand our consumer and his buying preferences. We also believe based on our surveys that beyond simply taking share, we will actually grow the men's category in North America. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season, given the current sales trends in our Retail businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the largely growing men's accessory category. A fourth has emerged as a global business driver and was also mentioned by Mike, and that is leveraging the growing power of the digital world. 
Coach's digital initiatives are an important and effective complementary strategy to our distribution growth as we continue to grow our store base in North America and worldwide. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 14% this year compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores for this year, including the 21 opened in the first half. The FY '12 opening includes about 15 Full Price and 25 Factory outlets, with about half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% to 11% this year driven by men's. 
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or, at least, an additional 15 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we remain confident that we will achieve at least $300 million in sales during the current fiscal year. 
In Japan, spending has remained stable after the first 2 quarters of volatility in the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, notably in the men's business. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan or an additional 7 net new stores for the balance of the year, nearly all of them dedicated men's locations. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, at the beginning of this month, we successfully transitioned our Domestic Retail businesses in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at Retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of the Singapore business last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of the Malaysia Domestic Retail operations next July. It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asian distribution center. In addition, we find that these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience. 
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. We're also pleased to announce other distribution agreements for Latin America, initially including Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Chile, and to Indonesia, where the first store's opening next year. 
Touching on Europe, we are building a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we are beginning to build our multichannel model. Today, we have 3 stores, all opened in the last 12 months, including a mall store in Westfield, our new Bond Street flagship and a Factory store. We will be opening our second London flagship on Regent Street this spring. Importantly, we are gaining traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and a majority of our business is coming from local customers. And second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist, as we continue to grow our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. 
In closing, we're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our business at a double-digit pace. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,146112863,210040,"Coach, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results.

Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 17%, and our Indirect business was even with last year due to shipment timing into international wholesale accounts. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $1.18 as compared to $1 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $347 million from $303 million. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $521 million in the second quarter, up 15% from $453 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36% compared to 35.9% in the year-ago period. In the second quarter, gross profit rose 14% to $1.05 billion, up from $915 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.2% compared to 72.4% the prior year. As expected, we showed a continued sequential improvement in the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from the prior year level in the second quarter and represented 36.2% of sales versus 36.5%. 
As mentioned in our press release, during the second quarter, we recorded certain items. They included the onetime effect of a reevaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in the Japanese corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multiyear pricing agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased our tax provision by $12 million. As a result, we made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, increasing SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the effect of the onetime tax benefit to net income and earnings per share. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter-end were $429 million, up 17% from the end of last year's Q2 and consistent with our sales growth. This inventory level allow us to support 31 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations at Coach Japan and 23 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this spring.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion as compared with $940 million a year ago, despite repurchases of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $62.48, spending a total of $300 million, taking our first half total to about $360 million. At the end of the quarter, about $600 million remained on our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating opportunities -- activities in the second quarter was $604 million compared to $408 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $555 million versus $382 million in the same period last year. 
Our CapEx spending was $39 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the rest of the fiscal year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales growth with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp sales in North America for the second half of the fiscal year. Second, as we said before, we expect our second half gross margin to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be essentially level with prior year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years, at about 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

And I think what we plan to do with the investor community is share a very detailed global view of our approach to men's expansion for FY '13. But let me give you some grounding and some headlines on what we're doing. First, we're very pleased with the results of our freestanding men's stores. There are a handful of them out there. They are great learning platforms for us, and the performance in those stores is excellent. The larger opportunity that we see is actually expanding our men's business in existing Retail locations through shop-in-shops, what we call concept shops and, in fact, selling more men's products in all stores globally. We're doing this through increased presentations through actually selling our product via our website, enabled in-store through laptops. There's a very broad opportunity for us to sell more product in men's. Where I see us going in Father's Day is several new men's shops which will be installed this spring. The opening of our Pentagon dual-gender location, which will happen in May. That's a women's and men's side-by-side location. And as we enter FY '13, a significant rollout of men's shops in existing Retail locations. So where we see the growth is driving productivity in our existing stores, taking advantage of the men's momentum that we're seeing through CBSR, our Coach By Special Request program, as well as growing freestanding men's stores. Victor, if you want to add little bit on the global side, what we're doing in Asia?"

The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billio",389,"Sure. When we look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billion market. Of that, Japan is approximately $4.4 billion; China at $3.2 billion, including Hong Kong, Macau, including duty-free; and then the rest in -- the rest of Asia. Japan, the men's penetration is at about 25%, and we're still very much in a rollout stage. Today, we have 14 dedicated men's locations, 7 in Full Price, 7 in Factory. As many of you know, most of our distribution in Japan is within department stores where we are on the women's handbag floor, and there, the opportunity will be to increase distribution with the men's floors, which we are now commencing. And initial results have been quite promising. China is really a massive opportunity for us. When we look at mainland China, for many of our competitor brands, men's represent 50% or more of their sales. And there, of our 65 mainland China locations today, 28 of them are dual-gender locations where we have, basically, stand-alone men's presences. Of the 30 locations we are opening this fiscal year, practically all of them will be dual-gender locations. So we're starting with -- very early stages, as basically a global men's and women's brand. And we are seeing truly terrific results with very early stages, 25% to 30% penetration for men's in these locations at a point where we really still don't have an awareness as a men's brand. As many of you know, in the past, we've discussed our brand awareness, our unaided brand awareness at 16%, up from 8% last year, and we're really just starting in the men's space. So to achieve these penetrations this early is truly exciting and bodes well for the future. And in the rest of Asia, we're still at our very early stages. We have, of course, as Lew announced, just taken back our Singapore business and Taiwan only a few weeks ago. And there, we are commencing the men's rollout as well, and that -- and expect to see similar penetrations to what we're seeing in China in the medium term, in the next 2 to 3 years."

At present, I would say it's -- in North America, a slightly greater proportion of men's is for gift than self-purchased, we estimate self-purchase. Among women -- I'm sorry. Gifting for women is about 20% of our sales. I would estimate men's might be 30%. It's obviously a great marketing opportunity for us, and you'll see us just distorting a good portion of our marketing globally, both on the Internet and in traditional media, as well as social networking towards men's to both build awareness and to encourage gifting. And in terms of existing consumers versus new consumers, we are in North America attracting a higher rate of new customers into the franchise through men's than we are women's. But that should be expected, because the women's business is, of course, extremely developed with growth opportunities ahead. But in men's, it's early days. In terms of distribution growth versus same-store sales growth, what I -- I am being cautioned not to provide much detail. What I would say is that we are achieving significant double-digit same-store growth in the men's area."

We have enough exposure in the marketplace and enough experience with consumers to know that the concept is a very proven concept and the category is very real. We need a little more time to very tactically break out the opportunity from a distribution standpoint: our digital opportunity with our men's website; our global opportunity in terms of store footprint, both the existing opportunity in large-format flagship stores to add men; the new opportunity to develop men's and women's dual-gender stores; and how we can provide a men's presence in all stores where we trade that are currently women's stores is something we need to sort out. So we need to really work through the entire fleet in Full Price in North America alone. That's 350 stores. We're doing that work today, and we have traction in each of the formats, which gives us a path for growth. On the product side, what's interesting is that as we expand this category, it's not all about bags. Bag is still the anchor, but we're seeing very strong response to Accessory, to lifestyle category, to emerging categories like by footwear, outerwear, small travel pieces. So we believe that this concept hangs very well on its own and drive very strong productivity metrics comparable to our women's business in terms of ticket size and from a margin structure very comparable as well."

We are, as Lew mentioned in his opening remarks today, 80 doors, with the vast majority of those, 65, on the mainland. When we look at the opportunity, it is truly boundless. And, Barbara, you know well the socio-demographic socio-economics of the market, 1.3 billion population, of which 50% is urban and continuing to urbanize, already 120 cities with a population of 1 million or more. We are today only in 28 of those cities. And with our broad collection from a style perspective as well as our broad price points, we're able to much more easily than traditional luxury brands, of course, to go into the second- and third-tier cities, where we're seeing success. Of course, we are also seeing a rapidly growing middle class, and we're not seeing many limitations from a distribution perspective. When we start looking at Coach's strategy towards a multichannel -- towards multichannel rollout, China really fits nicely. We have approximately 600 department store doors today in China, of which already over 110, 120 are doing incredibly well in the imported luxury cosmetics space, which serves as a barometer for us. Malls are continuing to develop nicely, both in the Full Price as well now an increasing rollout of Factory outlet malls, of course, which we know well. Looking at the rollout for this year, as we've announced, 30 doors, and we see us continuing at that pace for the foreseeable future. I think the second question was on products, and there, we really don't see a tremendous difference globally, quite frankly, in terms of our collection. Madison, Poppy, Kristin are truly global collections for us. The difference and what truly differentiates Coach from many of our competitors is that we have a group of very talented merchants in each of our markets. We're supported by a truly -- a superb consumer insight team. We're constantly listening to our consumers, and that allow us to tweak our collections, whether it be from color, size, shape, style, and, therefore, maximize the opportunity in each of our markets. But the difference, as I touched to earlier, of course, in China is really the men's opportunity, and we're starting out from the beginning in these very early stages as a dual-gender brand. Whereas we have been 3, 4 years earlier opening 1,000- to 1,500-square-feet locations that were basically women's only locations, today, we're targeting 2,000- to 2,500-square-feet, on average, locations with a men's and women's entrance in most cases and getting truly terrific results in seeing our products resonate, even though we still have very low awareness levels at these early days. Touching on duty-free, and specifically, we're looking at, I would say, 2 parts of the travel Retail piece. Of course, for China, the big opportunity is, outside of China, approximately half of Chinese luxury sales occur outside of China. We're very active in this, developing our distribution in Asia, and we're seeing tremendous benefits from that, of course, within China itself, in Hong Kong and Macau, and beginning to see some of that in other markets as well. Within China domestically at the airports, there will be opportunities, both in the duty-paid as well as in the duty-free spaces as airport authorities begin to put the infrastructure in place. It's something we're investigating. We haven't made a move in that space at the moment, because there's so much opportunity in the urban areas themselves that we're going after, but it is something that we're paying attention to."

Before we begin, we must point out this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the strength of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platform and our multichannel international distribution model. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation. 
In addition, we made continued progress against our key global business initiatives, including expanding our share in the growing North American bag and accessory market, increasing our international presence, leveraging our heritage in the men's business and expanding our digital presence. We've experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. 
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 18% to $1.18 compared with $1 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.45 billion versus $1.26 billion a year ago, an increase of 15%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, rose 17% to $1.3 billion from $1.3 -- from $1.1 billion in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.8% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 6% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth with significant double-digit comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened 5 Retail stores and 5 Factory stores in North America, including 2 men's Retail stores and 1 men's Factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 Full Price and 157 Factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan. Six locations were opened, including 4 men's locations. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan with 22 Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 33 Factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel Retail locations. 
And in China, we added 9 locations: 8 in the mainland and 1 in Hong Kong, our Nathan Road flagship, which, I might add, is doing very well. At the end of the quarter, there were 80 Coach locations in China, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 65 locations on the mainland in 28 cities. As we discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, Retail stores, shop-in-shops and Factory stores. 
Indirect sales were even with prior year on a comparable basis at $166 million. Results reflected shipment timing differences from prior year in our international wholesale businesses. Sales for the quarter at Retail and international wholesale locations increased at a double-digit pace, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores were even with last year's holiday quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding 9 months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's women's handbag and accessory sales rose about 12% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 15%. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we saw modest improvement in our customers' outlook to the economy compared to a quarter ago, with about 60% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 48%. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with about 2/3 of consumer surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 15%, with our directly operated businesses up 17%, driven by 8.8% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. As noted in our press release, all direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brands. Mike will provide additional details around some of these initiatives in just a moment. 
Fueling these overall strong comp results were similar gains in both store channels, driven by conversion and average transaction size, and continued strength in our e-commerce business. Overall Retail traffic rose with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters, while traffic on coach.com continues to gain momentum. 
As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose again sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the excellent comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. 
Consistent with our strategy of building brand awareness in China, we took a number of important steps during the second quarter. First, we launched an integrated marketing campaign with our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, that included advertising across print, outdoor and the web, as well as the 70th anniversary gala dinner and gallery event in Beijing. Another key components of the campaign were the successful launch of our presence on Sina Weibo, the leading social networking site in China. In December, we also became the first U.S. incorporated company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
All of these events helped to drive increased awareness for our brands. While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America. There were 3 important productivity drivers within our North American business: overall product performance, our digital strategy and coach.com results and continued progress on our new men's initiative. 
During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. Our strategy to flow more product later in the quarter versus previous seasons was also very successful. 
To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail was also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Also new to Madison were the Mini Sophia, the flap carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. This was our most fully developed Madison offering, and we saw the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago. 
For November, Poppy was the focus, offered in new styles, including 2 totes, a foldover cross-body silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss, a soft patent, lightweight fabric with diamond quilting and chain straps brought additional excitement and vibrant color to the collection. We also added some newness to Chelsea, only introduced last fall, with a classic tote featuring chain details at compelling price points. 
Right before Thanksgiving, we refreshed our offering with updates to Madison and Kristin, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday seasons. Our mid-December significant Madison refresh also delivered newness closer to our peak selling period. 
Of course, we also had a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wristlets, and a wide range of items under $100. Our holiday product was supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, which began in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing was product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign spanned coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing. Our addition of digital media to select high-profile store windows was a new element to our in-store marketing and was very well-received. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. Just last week, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view with several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and the Poppy Willis, which harkens back to classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, the focus will be on Kristin, with 4 new styles across multiple fabrications and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft feminine colors. 
On the Factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introduction with key styles offered at great prices. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As you know from previous calls, our digital objective in North America is to drive traffic and build brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunities. Some of our key online initiatives are, first, mobile commerce. We launched our mobile commerce platform this past May, and almost 20% of our web traffic came through a mobile device this holiday season. 
Second, social media. With over 2.7 million Coach fans on Facebook, this social platform continues to evolve in its contribution to our overall brand message and success. Facebook provides us with additional marketing and potential revenue opportunities as we continue to learn how to engage with our customer in this space. 
Third, Factory online. As mentioned in our last call, in the U.S., we introduced our invitation-only flash-sale site, targeted only towards our most loyal Factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online while enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores. We're quite pleased with the results of this highly profitable initiative. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American Retail digital initiatives, clearly, the Internet will continue to increase in importance globally as both a marketing and communication vehicle and a sales driver. We now have a web presence in 20 countries, 3 of which are commerce-enabled, and we welcome several million visitors outside of North America in the quarter. In China, we're continuing to develop our digital programs and capabilities, which include a planned launch of e-commerce. Additionally, as we grow our international database, we're programmatically communicating with our international consumers via e-mail and seeing engagement at the levels we enjoy here in the U.S. We believe in digital and are clearly recognizing the benefits of this growth vehicle. Our intent is to drive further innovation in this channel, both in the near and long term. 
As we mentioned in our press release, we're also really excited about the results we're achieving in our men's business, which is on track to double again in fiscal year '12 to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. 
In North America, we see men's both -- as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. We believe that in this fragmented category where there's no dominant player, Coach has the opportunity to become the market leader. Our approach to growing men's is to create great product, present it in exciting formats, combined with the rigor that we use to understand our consumer and his buying preferences. We also believe based on our surveys that beyond simply taking share, we will actually grow the men's category in North America. 
In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season, given the current sales trends in our Retail businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the largely growing men's accessory category. A fourth has emerged as a global business driver and was also mentioned by Mike, and that is leveraging the growing power of the digital world. 
Coach's digital initiatives are an important and effective complementary strategy to our distribution growth as we continue to grow our store base in North America and worldwide. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 14% this year compared to 9% last year. 
Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores for this year, including the 21 opened in the first half. The FY '12 opening includes about 15 Full Price and 25 Factory outlets, with about half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% to 11% this year driven by men's. 
Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or, at least, an additional 15 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we remain confident that we will achieve at least $300 million in sales during the current fiscal year. 
In Japan, spending has remained stable after the first 2 quarters of volatility in the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, notably in the men's business. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan or an additional 7 net new stores for the balance of the year, nearly all of them dedicated men's locations. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, at the beginning of this month, we successfully transitioned our Domestic Retail businesses in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at Retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of the Singapore business last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of the Malaysia Domestic Retail operations next July. It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asian distribution center. In addition, we find that these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience. 
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. We're also pleased to announce other distribution agreements for Latin America, initially including Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Chile, and to Indonesia, where the first store's opening next year. 
Touching on Europe, we are building a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we are beginning to build our multichannel model. Today, we have 3 stores, all opened in the last 12 months, including a mall store in Westfield, our new Bond Street flagship and a Factory store. We will be opening our second London flagship on Regent Street this spring. Importantly, we are gaining traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and a majority of our business is coming from local customers. And second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist, as we continue to grow our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. 
In closing, we're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our business at a double-digit pace. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,146112863,210114,"Coach, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results.

Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 17%, and our Indirect business was even with last year due to shipment timing into international wholesale accounts. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $1.18 as compared to $1 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $347 million from $303 million. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $521 million in the second quarter, up 15% from $453 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36% compared to 35.9% in the year-ago period. In the second quarter, gross profit rose 14% to $1.05 billion, up from $915 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.2% compared to 72.4% the prior year. As expected, we showed a continued sequential improvement in the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from the prior year level in the second quarter and represented 36.2% of sales versus 36.5%. 
As mentioned in our press release, during the second quarter, we recorded certain items. They included the onetime effect of a reevaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in the Japanese corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multiyear pricing agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased our tax provision by $12 million. As a result, we made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, increasing SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the effect of the onetime tax benefit to net income and earnings per share. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter-end were $429 million, up 17% from the end of last year's Q2 and consistent with our sales growth. This inventory level allow us to support 31 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations at Coach Japan and 23 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this spring.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion as compared with $940 million a year ago, despite repurchases of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $62.48, spending a total of $300 million, taking our first half total to about $360 million. At the end of the quarter, about $600 million remained on our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating opportunities -- activities in the second quarter was $604 million compared to $408 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $555 million versus $382 million in the same period last year. 
Our CapEx spending was $39 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the rest of the fiscal year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales growth with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp sales in North America for the second half of the fiscal year. Second, as we said before, we expect our second half gross margin to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be essentially level with prior year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years, at about 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.
Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

But to actually try to dimensionalize it, as Mike said, we're experiencing success wherever we're offering a comprehensive assortment of men's, again, across all geographies and all channels, and it's extremely exciting for us. Second, men's spending globally represents about 15% of the global luxury spend. For Coach, with our sales expected as -- men's sales expected at $400 million, that will represent about 8% of our overall sales for this fiscal year.

And I think what we plan to do with the investor community is share a very detailed global view of our approach to men's expansion for FY '13. But let me give you some grounding and some headlines on what we're doing. First, we're very pleased with the results of our freestanding men's stores. There are a handful of them out there. They are great learning platforms for us, and the performance in those stores is excellent. The larger opportunity that we see is actually expanding our men's business in existing Retail locations through shop-in-shops, what we call concept shops and, in fact, selling more men's products in all stores globally. We're doing this through increased presentations through actually selling our product via our website, enabled in-store through laptops. There's a very broad opportunity for us to sell more product in men's. Where I see us going in Father's Day is several new men's shops which will be installed this spring. The opening of our Pentagon dual-gender location, which will happen in May. That's a women's and men's side-by-side location. And as we enter FY '13, a significant rollout of men's shops in existing Retail locations. So where we see the growth is driving productivity in our existing stores, taking advantage of the men's momentum that we're seeing through CBSR, our Coach By Special Request program, as well as growing freestanding men's stores. Victor, if you want to add little bit on the global side, what we're doing in Asia?"

When we look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billion market. Of that, Japan is approximately $4.4 billion; China at $3.2 billion, including Hong Kong, Macau, including duty-free; and then the rest in -- the rest of Asia. Japan, the men's penetration is at about 25%, and we're still very much in a rollout stage. Today, we have 14 dedicated men's locations, 7 in Full Price, 7 in Factory. As many of you know, most of our distribution in Japan is within department stores where we are on the women's handbag floor, and there, the opportunity will be to increase distribution with the men's floors, which we are now commencing. And initial results have been quite promising. China is really a massive opportunity for us. When we look at mainland China, for many of our competitor brands, men's represent 50% or more of their sales. And there, of our 65 mainland China locations today, 28 of them are dual-gender locations where we have, basically, stand-alone men's presences. Of the 30 locations we are opening this fiscal year, practically all of them will be dual-gender locations. So we're starting with -- very early stages, as basically a global men's and women's brand. And we are seeing truly terrific results with very early stages, 25% to 30% penetration for men's in these locations at a point where we really still don't have an awareness as a men's brand. As many of you know, in the past, we've discussed our brand awareness, our unaided brand awareness at 16%, up from 8% last year, and we're really just starting in the men's space. So to achieve these penetrations this early is truly exciting and bodes well for the future. And in the rest of Asia, we're still at our very early stages. We have, of course, as Lew announced, just taken back our Singapore business and Taiwan only a few weeks ago. And there, we are commencing the men's rollout as well, and that -- and expect to see similar penetrations to what we're seeing in China in the medium term, in the next 2 to 3 years."

At present, I would say it's -- in North America, a slightly greater proportion of men's is for gift than self-purchased, we estimate self-purchase. Among women -- I'm sorry. Gifting for women is about 20% of our sales. I would estimate men's might be 30%. It's obviously a great marketing opportunity for us, and you'll see us just distorting a good portion of our marketing globally, both on the Internet and in traditional media, as well as social networking towards men's to both build awareness and to encourage gifting. And in terms of existing consumers versus new consumers, we are in North America attracting a higher rate of new customers into the franchise through men's than we are women's. But that should be expected, because the women's business is, of course, extremely developed with growth opportunities ahead. But in men's, it's early days. In terms of distribution growth versus same-store sales growth, what I -- I am being cautioned not to provide much detail. What I would say is that we are achieving significant double-digit same-store growth in the men's area."

We have enough exposure in the marketplace and enough experience with consumers to know that the concept is a very proven concept and the category is very real. We need a little more time to very tactically break out the opportunity from a distribution standpoint: our digital opportunity with our men's website; our global opportunity in terms of store footprint, both the existing opportunity in large-format flagship stores to add men; the new opportunity to develop men's and women's dual-gender stores; and how we can provide a men's presence in all stores where we trade that are currently women's stores is something we need to sort out. So we need to really work through the entire fleet in Full Price in North America alone. That's 350 stores. We're doing that work today, and we have traction in each of the formats, which gives us a path for growth. On the product side, what's interesting is that as we expand this category, it's not all about bags. Bag is still the anchor, but we're seeing very strong response to Accessory, to lifestyle category, to emerging categories like by footwear, outerwear, small travel pieces. So we believe that this concept hangs very well on its own and drive very strong productivity metrics comparable to our women's business in terms of ticket size and from a margin structure very comparable as well."

We are, as Lew mentioned in his opening remarks today, 80 doors, with the vast majority of those, 65, on the mainland. When we look at the opportunity, it is truly boundless. And, Barbara, you know well the socio-demographic socio-economics of the market, 1.3 billion population, of which 50% is urban and continuing to urbanize, already 120 cities with a population of 1 million or more. We are today only in 28 of those cities. And with our broad collection from a style perspective as well as our broad price points, we're able to much more easily than traditional luxury brands, of course, to go into the second- and third-tier cities, where we're seeing success. Of course, we are also seeing a rapidly growing middle class, and we're not seeing many limitations from a distribution perspective. When we start looking at Coach's strategy towards a multichannel -- towards multichannel rollout, China really fits nicely. We have approximately 600 department store doors today in China, of which already over 110, 120 are doing incredibly well in the imported luxury cosmetics space, which serves as a barometer for us. Malls are continuing to develop nicely, both in the Full Price as well now an increasing rollout of Factory outlet malls, of course, which we know well. Looking at the rollout for this year, as we've announced, 30 doors, and we see us continuing at that pace for the foreseeable future. I think the second question was on products, and there, we really don't see a tremendous difference globally, quite frankly, in terms of our collection. Madison, Poppy, Kristin are truly global collections for us. The difference and what truly differentiates Coach from many of our competitors is that we have a group of very talented merchants in each of our markets. We're supported by a truly -- a superb consumer insight team. We're constantly listening to our consumers, and that allow us to tweak our collections, whether it be from color, size, shape, style, and, therefore, maximize the opportunity in each of our markets. But the difference, as I touched to earlier, of course, in China is really the men's opportunity, and we're starting out from the beginning in these very early stages as a dual-gender brand. Whereas we have been 3, 4 years earlier opening 1,000- to 1,500-square-feet locations that were basically women's only locations. Today, we're targeting 2,000- to 2,500-square-feet on average. Locations with a men's and women's entrance in most cases and getting truly terrific results in seeing our products resonate, even though we still have very low awareness levels at these early days. Touching on duty-free, and specifically, we're looking at, I would say, 2 parts of the travel Retail piece. Of course, for China, the big opportunity is, outside of China, approximately half of Chinese luxury sales occur outside of China. We're very active in this, developing our distribution in Asia, and we're seeing tremendous benefits from that, of course, within China itself, in Hong Kong and Macau, and beginning to see some of that in other markets as well. Within China domestically at the airports, there will be opportunities, both in the duty-paid as well as in the duty-free spaces as airport authorities begin to put the infrastructure in place. It's something we're investigating. We haven't made a move in that space at the moment, because there's so much opportunity in the urban areas themselves that we're going after, but it is something that we're paying attention to."

Is it all relief and sourcing, and how that's happening? And then on the new headquarters that we've been hearing about, can you maybe talk about any cash flow implications from that, and does that change -- or your commitment towards your continued share repurchases or dividends? Maybe just talk about the cash flow and your minimal cash balance requirements."

And it's hard work that we've done, a lot of work trying to get raw material sources in place to help offset -- working on where we're doing our manufacturing, how we're doing it. But it is still a pressure that we have to cope with that, push it the wrong way, and it creates some pressure on our margin. We're forcing in that as our International business does grow.  Particularly in Asia, that's a plus. But then there's -- we have puts and takes. As we expand the other markets we get, we go the other direction. So we are really striving to kind of -- to lose point to hold the ground. But there are puts and takes, and we fight that battle every other time. And we've talked, I think, before about our kind of sourcing activities in Vietnam, India. We're actually continuing to expand that and aggressively look at that. We've had some great successes that have worked to our benefit. I think it's a reflection of the talent we have offshore, which we think is unique to Coach, to really build manufacturing capabilities.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, including strong sales and earnings growth, as well as operating margin expansion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the Coach brand, our innovative and relevant product offering and our multichannel international distribution model. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future. While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I wanted to take the time to review our quarter first. 
Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 24% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.11 billion versus $951 million a year ago, an increase of 17%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales now include Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Taiwan rose 18% to $984 million from $837 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 6.7% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 13%; fifth, we continued to generate very strong sales growth of nearly 60% and double-digit comps in China where we remain on course to generate at least $300 million in sales this year; and finally, sales in Japan rose 10% versus prior year in constant currency and rose 14% in dollars. 
In North America during the quarter, we opened 1 retail store, closed another while opening 5 factory stores, including 2 men's factory stores, thus at the end of the period, there are 350 Full Price and 162 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to China. We added 5 new locations all on the Mainland bringing us to 85 Coach locations at quartering end, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 70 locations on the Mainland in 32 cities. And in Japan, 3 locations were opened, all Men's, while 3 were closed. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan. 
Finally, I thought I would briefly mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 6 locations, 5 were acquired last July and we've opened 1 additional store since. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January. 
Indirect sales rose 10% from prior year to $125 million from $114 million on a comparable basis. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased, while sales at POS in U.S. department store's were modestly below last year's third quarter. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category grew about 10% in the March quarter, consistent with the increases it experienced over the last year. Similarly, Coach's total North American women's bag and accessory business grew at the same rate as a category over the period. Separately, it's worth noting that we once again saw continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy with about 66% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 60% last quarter and 58% a year ago. 
Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. In North America, our total revenues rose 12%, with our directly operated businesses up 13%, driven by a 7% comp as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. All direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. 
The primary driver of our retail comping was the increase in the overall number of transactions while an increase in average transaction size contributed as well. Overall retail traffic rose as traffic on the Internet continue to gain momentum with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters. 
Turning to our store channels. Both performed similarly fueled by average transaction size gains, while conversions also rose in retail stores. As we've discussed many times outside in North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% from prior year fueled by distribution and double-digit, same-store sales growth. This overall growth rate was similar to our last quarter with the change in composition of the drivers as distribution was the larger contributor to growth. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent of over 90% among existing customers. 
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some organizational changes which we put into place over the quarter to more closely align the leadership of Coach with the needs of our business both in North America and in our rapidly expanding international markets. These changes will help us leverage our many business opportunities around the world and prepare us to operate efficiently at the scale we envision during our planning horizon. 
First, Mike Tucci has assumed the new role of North American Group President responsible for North American Retail, global, Digital Media and customer engagement and North American wholesale. This will ensure an even more cohesive approach to our bad merchandising and retail experience wherever our customers choose to shop with us in North America. And second, on the international side, Victor Luis has assumed a new role of International Group President responsible for our directly operated Retail businesses in Coach Japan, Coach China and Coach Asia and for our wholesale business within Coach international. This will facilitate an even smoother transition of businesses we plan to manage directly in the future such as Malaysia and Korea. It will create significant synergies as we look to optimize our brand experience in our own directly managed stores and our distributorships in Coach Europe and in a growing global travel retail market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business and our global product initiatives. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives in our Men's business. As noted in our press",706,"Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives in our Men's business. 
As noted in our press release, we leveraged the underlying strength in our North American business and implemented a significant shift in our pricing strategy in factory stores during the quarter, as we eliminated in-store couponing across our network. Our new ""no math"" pricing structure provide us with greater marketing flexibility in a more targeted value proposition while enabling us to drive excellent margins. Additionally, our store associates can now devote more time and energy to engagement sharing product knowledge and building the sale. Complementing these in-store strategies, we expanded our e-commerce factory programs. As you know, earlier this fiscal year, we introduced an invitation-only, flat sale site targeted towards our most loyal, factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online, enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores for a limited time period. We also began working with a number of small of third-party flash sites targeting their unique databases of value-conscious consumers with the intention of introducing them to Coach factory, which also contributed to our overall comp this quarter. Our early results indicate further opportunity for highly profitable customer acquisition in this value channel. 
Moving on to product. During the third quarter, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view in several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo, and most importantly, though Willis, which harkens back to classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, we focused on Kristen with 4 new styles across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft, feminine colors. At the end of the quarter, we launched Hamptons Weekend, primarily a tote and shareholder bag group, which was also informed by collection from our archives. 
One of the most exciting product successes we're enjoying is the excellent consumer response to both Willis and Hamptons Weekend on a global label. Both of these groups rooted in classic Coach are precursors to and will be components of a major collection launch this summer called Legacy. Also inspired by our heritage grounded in leather and featuring iconic Coach elements, the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection will encompass the complete world of Coach and will be our largest product launch in many years. Early pilots are currently underway and results underscore our confidence in this major initiatives. 
The Legacy launch will also drive new merchandising strategies across all retail stores, including presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves, presenting men's and women's together any powerful store environment and driving major color stories and handbags and accessories to highlight key items. We're also very excited about the results we are continuing to achieve and our Men's business, which is on track to double again this year to over $400 million globally. We're experiencing success in Men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. 
In North America, we see Men's as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. Given this success, we're now accelerating the rollout of Men's within existing retail stores. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a broader expression of Men's in nearly 100 Coach retail stores in North America, up from 42 at the end of the third quarter. Outside the U.S. where men participate in the category at a higher date, new dual-gender and dedicated men's shops will remain a primary distribution growth vehicles. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity in our Men's initiatives. We're feeling great about the balance of the spring season, given the current sales trends in our Retail businesses and the Legacy launch in the seasons ahead. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and other opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have 4 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North American markets; second, leveraging the global opportunity; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
As I our distribution plans for the current year haven't changed since our last earnings call in January, I will briefly recap. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 13% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we're in cost to open about 40 new stores this year, including the 27 opened during the first 9 months. These openings will include about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with about half being dedicated Men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% this year driven by Men's.
Turning to China. As you know, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 10 for the balance of fiscal year, bringing a total to about 95 at the end of FY '12. All of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. 
In Japan, we now expect to open about 10 net new locations with an additional 2 net new stores expected during the fourth quarter. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to 3% last year. Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets at the beginning of the quarter, we transitioned our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which adds about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of Singapore last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of our Malaysian Domestic Retail operations in July as we have previously announced. In addition, as noted in our press release, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to take control of our Korean domestic retail business from our current distributor Shinsegae International effective in early FY '13. Over the last several years, we have enjoyed an excellent partnership with Shinsegae. They have been instrumental in the development of the Coach brand in Korea, including the opening of several important locations in key department stores in Seoul and other major cities throughout the country. For perspective, our current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million including global travel retail or about 5% of the $2.4 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 47 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean and travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party, duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement. 
It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we have already made in the region utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia Shared Services Center and the Asia Distribution Center. In addition, we find the stores experience a significant improvement and productivity when they become directly managed as we control the total brand experience.
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have thriving distributor-run businesses in other locations. This year, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. In fact, our first location in Brazil opened earlier this month in Morumbi Shoppings Mall to an excellent consumer responds. We believe this bodes well for our expansion into other South American countries later this calendar year. 
Touching on Europe where we're beginning to build a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. This week, we will open a shop-in-shop in Liberty Department Store and a flagship store on Regent Street. We are continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. Second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our Key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist, as we build men's -- as we build brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. In total, we expect to open 11 locations in Europe in FY '12 bringing our total locations to 25 by year-end.
In closing, we're energized by the continued pace of change in growth at Coach. We're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our momentum and enable us to realize the many opportunities in front of us. At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,197120929,287209,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the working financials of our third quarter results. As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our Direct-to-Consumer segment,",923,"Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the working financials of our third quarter results. As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our Direct-to-Consumer segment, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 18%, and our Indirect business rose 10%. As a reminder, the year-ago revenues for both segments were adjusted for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $0.77 as compared to $0.62 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $225 million from $186 million. For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $337 million, up 21% from $282 million reported on a non-GAAP basis in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter expanded 100 basis points to 30.4% compared to 29.4% in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 18% to $818 million from $692 million a year ago, and gross margin rate expanded 100 basis points to 73.8% compared to 72.8% the prior year, driven by both manufacturing cost benefits and new pricing strategies implemented in the quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to hold our expense rate in the third quarter given the previously discussed impact of the Taiwan transition. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.3% versus 43.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our press release, during the year-ago quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contribution which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the prior year's third quarter was $254 million with a 26.7% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 46.1%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $475 million, up 21% from Q3 last year. This inventory level allows us to support 34 net new North American stores, 10 net new locations in Coach Japan and the 30 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our Men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends enabling us to meet demand this season. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $930 million as compared with $886 million a year ago after the repurchase of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $73.92, spending a total of $172 million taking our fiscal year-to-date  total to about $530 million. At the end of the quarter, about $430 million remained in our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $103 million compared with $227 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $61 million versus $186 million in the same period last year primarily reflecting the changes in accrued income taxes and charitable donations. Our CapEx spending was $41 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiative, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well-positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. To elaborate on our fourth quarter assumptions: First, we expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. This plan includes North America comp sales at least as high as what we generated in the third quarter as we continue to balance productivity gain with the margin improvement. Second, we continue to expect gross margin to expand from prior year levels in the fourth quarter driven by our sorting initiatives and pricing strategy. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be similar to prior year levels. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Given that we've been accelerating the transition of distributor-operated wholesale businesses to our direct control, we would expect expenses to slightly outpace top line growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, however, our SG&A expense rate should be similar to FY '11. Fourth, and based on the metrics I've just described, we believe that we will continue to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a full year operating margin slightly ahead of last year's rate of 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words, this is an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our spring results bode well for the future, and we're confident we can continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.

Now let me first say, the category continues to grow worldwide. And here in the U.S., it's growing at a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand, and while our growth on the women",333,"Sure. Now let me first say, the category continues to grow worldwide. And here in the U.S., it's growing at a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand, and while our growth on the women's side are equaled -- [indiscernible] during the last quarter, our overall growth exceeded the dual-gender growth in premium bags and accessories. So there's a lot of opportunity. First, with regard to Men's, as Mike indicated, our business is on-track to double to over $400 million this year globally, which represents about 8% of our sales. We believe next year it will be well in excess of 10% of our business. And we are accelerating the introduction of Men's into a much broader range of our full-priced stores and shop-in-shops worldwide. So we're looking to capitalize in the growing category and the strength of the product offering and of course our growing brand loyalty in this category. Secondly, and more broadly on the product front, as Mike indicated and we've talked about many times, Bob, the launching of Legacy, which is a global lifestyle brand of concept which is a dual-gender, and we are using that to re-platform our Full Price stores. And we have enormous optimism for what that group is going to do. Mike mentioned our pilots are doing really well. So combination of Men's and the re-platforming on the Women's side to really focus on Legacy. And of course, internationally, we have an enormous opportunity with the much larger role that Men's plays in markets such as China to truly establish ourselves as a dual-gender brand. The digital side should also be referenced, Bob. We're so excited about the progress we've made in this last year to harness its power and to really get consumers an opportunity to shop wherever they choose to shop. And with our very robust 15 million database in North America, it gives us great, great opportunities."

And what we saw with the all-store discounting is sort of a blanket affect on promotional stance in factory stores. And with the underlying strength in the business coming out of Q2, we really made the determination that we could get away from that and leverage cost savings by being more targeted in a way that we market to our consumer and offer value to the consumer in the factory channel. We still have very strong productivity gains there, strong comps, and we were able to build in margin advantage, taking advantage of the costing opportunities that existed. So we believe it is long-term. We're working it everyday. We continue to probe and test for ideas around how we can play. We realize the factory is a value channel, and we'll continue to be aggressive there. But clearly gains for us on margin and maintaining strong productivity are very attractive, and we want to push hard as we move into the fall season to really take advantage of that."

We went back in with the Legacy launch which is targeted for late July. And we put together a plan in our stores. Lew used the phrase re-platforming to create a real strong visual presence in our stores around marketing and product presentation using the launch of Legacy as a catalyst. And we identified actually, to be precise, 108 stores that will get what I would call a more supercharged effort around presentation and physical enhancement. Coincidental with that, we also looked at our Men's proposition at 42 stores with shops or more expanded Men's presence and quickly made the leap and said, can we get Men's advanced and expanded in those 100 stores to take advantage of the duality between Legacy, the strength of the Women's proposition and the putting Men's in at the same time. That is all happening as we speak and will be front and center for the Legacy launch. We are at the same time looking at the balance of our 250 stores for further opportunity. We are working hard on lease expirations and opportunities for expansion in our primary mall locations, so this will be an ongoing effort. And my sense is that every quarter for every season, we'll have an opportunity to layer in more shops as we get deeper into the fleet. And as we get more empirical experience on the improved productivity that Men's gives us by adding it to an existing Women's store. My goal will be to get a stronger Men's presence in all stores very quickly. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to elaborate further, but we are doing things to bring Men's products closer to our consumers in all stores through technology and other marketing advantages that we have that will continue to probe and piloting. You'll see us doing more with that in the marketplace very soon as well."

First, I would just reiterate that we're extremely pleased, as Lew mentioned, with our terrific growth in the quarter, which had 60% to similar to the growth that we experienced last quarter. And we remain very much on-target to achieve our target of $300 million, which we announced last October. As Lew also mentioned with the shift in the drivers of growth this quarter with more of the sales increase coming from new doors which are performing ahead of our plans. Specifically, what we're seeing in terms of comp within China is increased travel and purchases internationally especially from the Tier 1 consumers, which would be the consumers from Shanghai, Beijing going more overseas. While the Tier 2 and Tier 3 consumers, these are consumers in second and third tier cities, shopping closer to home, driving our non-comp sale. I would remind now that we are at 32 cities across China, still a very small portion of the 120-or-so cities that have a population of 1 million or more. And indeed, of the 18 locations that we've opened  year-to-date in China, 14 have been in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And all but 1 of the locations that we will open this quarter are also in tier's 2 and Tier 3 cities. And these are cities that will be benefit disproportionately from the growth of the middle class and Chinese government investments in infrastructure. And longer term, as we think about as well as the fact that GDP consumption as a percentage of the GDP in China is that 35% compared with the 70% tier in the U.S. Of course, these vast majority of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will also be drivers within the longer-term opportunity for us. Specifically in terms of the models in new stores to the second part of your question, we have the same multichannel strategy in China that we leverage globally, opening up flagship stores, retail stores and shopping mall locations and department stores and factory outlets. And of course, each of these channels are at different levels within different cities. And the opportunity for us is always, first and foremost, to focus on providing the band with a very good position in each of the markets that's been expanding from there. We tend to first open within luxury malls, first and foremost, expanding then to department stores and more bridge or fashion malls as they developed. And the opportunity there is quite massive as most of these second- and third-tier cities still don't have these locations. They're only on the drawing board today. Then eventually of course into factory outlet malls, which will undoubtedly be a massive opportunity long-term within the China market, and they are only now beginning to gain a little bit of traction."

We see that as, again, offsetting pressures that exist in the market, so it's really more of trying to maintain our margin rate. The other thing that is really present itself is an opportunity in support of Victor's business is, they become more sophisticated in operating in Asia. We're looking at the idea how do we manufacture in a country to allow to take advantage of duty benefits. So as we come to more international global organization, we are finding that this opportunity for us to locate our manufacturing in a place where we can get trade benefits whether it be from Vietnam to Japan, et cetera. So those are the things we're looking for as we move through the future to continue to give us margin upside and advantages. And the idea that it's just one thing or is that another is really the work that might doing in this channel really complements the work that we're doing on the manufacturing side.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, including strong sales and earnings growth, as well as operating margin expansion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the Coach brand, our innovative and relevant product offering and our multichannel international distribution model. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future. 
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 24% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.11 billion versus $951 million a year ago, an increase of 17%; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, now include domestic retail businesses in Singapore and Taiwan rose 18% to $984 million from $837 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 6.7% from prior year while total North American direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%; fifth, we continued to generate very strong sales growth of nearly 60% and double-digit comps in China, where we remain on course to generate at least $300 million in sales this year; and finally, sales in Japan rose 10% versus prior year in constant currency and rose 14% in dollars. 
In North America during the quarter, we opened 1 retail store, closed another while opening 5 factory stores, including 2 Men's factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there are 350 full-priced and 162 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to China. We added 5 new locations, all on the Mainland, bringing us to 85 Coach locations at quarter end, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 70 locations on the Mainland in 32 cities. 
And in Japan, 3 locations were opened, all Men's, while 3 were closed. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan. 
Finally, I thought I would briefly mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 6 locations. Five were acquired last July, and we've opened one additional store since. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January. 
Indirect sales rose 10% from prior year to $125 million from $114 million on an -- on a comparable basis. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased while sales at POS in U.S. department stores were modestly below last year's third quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category grew about 10% in the March quarter, consistent with the increases it experienced over the last year. Similarly, Coach's total North American women's bag and accessory business grew at the same rate as the category over the period. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we once again saw continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy, with about 66% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 60% last quarter and 58% a year ago. 
Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. In North America, our total revenues rose 12%, with our directly operated businesses up 13% driven by a 7% comp as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. 
All direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. The primary driver of our retail comp gain was an increase in the overall number of transactions while an increase in average transaction size contributed as well. Overall retail traffic rose as traffic on the Internet continue to gain momentum, with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters. 
Turning to our store channels. Both performed similarly, fueled by average transaction size gains while conversion also rose in retail stores. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales growth. This overall growth rate was similar to our last quarter with a change in composition of the drivers, as distribution was the larger contributor to growth. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent of over 90% among existing customers. 
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some organizational changes, which we put into place over the quarter, to more closely align the leadership of Coach with the needs of our business, both in North America and in our rapidly expanding international markets. These changes will help us leverage our many business opportunities around the world and prepare us to operate efficiently at the scale we envision during our planning horizon. 
First, Mike Tucci has assumed the new role of North American Group President responsible for North American retail, global, digital media and customer engagement and North American wholesale. This will ensure an even more cohesive approach to our brand, merchandising and retail experience wherever our customers choose to shop with us in North America. 
And second, on the international side, Victor Luis has assumed a new role of International Group President responsible for our directly operated retail businesses in Coach Japan, Coach China and Coach Asia and for our wholesale business within Coach international. This will facilitate an even smoother transition of businesses we plan to manage directly in the future, such as Malaysia and Korea. It will create significant synergies as we look to optimize our brand experience in our own directly managed stores, in our distributorships in Coach Europe and in a growing global travel retail market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business and our global product initiative. Mike?"
526573,197120929,287429,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives in our Men's business. As noted in our pre",710,"Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives in our Men's business. 
As noted in our press release, we leveraged the underlying strength in our North American business and implemented a significant shift in our pricing strategy in factory stores during the quarter, as we eliminated in-store couponing across our network. Our new ""no math"" pricing structure provides us with greater marketing flexibility and a more targeted value proposition while enabling us to drive excellent margins. Additionally, our store associates can now devote more time and energy to engagement, sharing product knowledge and building the sale. 
Complementing these in-store strategies, we expanded our e-commerce factory programs. As you know, earlier this fiscal year, we introduced an invitation-only flash-sale site targeted towards our most loyal, factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online, enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores for a limited time period. 
We also began working with a number of small -- of third-party flash sites, targeting their unique databases of value-conscious consumers with the intention of introducing them to Coach factory, which also contributed to our overall comp this quarter. Our early results indicate further opportunity for highly profitable customer acquisition in this value channel. 
Moving on to product. During the third quarter, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view in several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and, most importantly, the Willis, which harkens back to the classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. 
In late February, we focused on Kristin with 4 new styles across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft, feminine colors. At the end of the quarter, we launched Hamptons Weekend, primarily a tote and shoulder bag group, which was also informed by a collection from our archives. 
One of the most exciting product successes we're enjoying is the excellent consumer response to both Willis and Hamptons Weekend on a global level. Both of these groups rooted in classic Coach are precursors to and will be components of a major collection launch this summer called Legacy. 
Also inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring iconic Coach elements, the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection will encompass the complete world of Coach and will be our largest product launch in many years. Early pilots are currently underway and results underscore our confidence in this major initiative. 
The Legacy launch will also drive new merchandising strategies across all retail stores, including presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment and driving major color stories and handbags and accessories to highlight key items. 
We're also very excited about the results we're continuing to achieve in our Men's business, which is on track to double again this year to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in Men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. In North America, we see Men's as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. 
Given this success, we're now accelerating the rollout of Men's within existing retail stores. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a broader expression of Men's in nearly 100 Coach retail stores in North America, up from 42 at the end of the third quarter. Outside the U.S. where Men participate in the category at a higher date, new dual gender and dedicated Men's shops will remain the primary distribution growth vehicles. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our Men's initiatives. We're feeling great about the balance of the spring season, given the current sales trends in our retail businesses and the Legacy launch in the seasons ahead. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and other opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have 4 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North American market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
As our distribution plans for the current year haven't changed since our last earnings call in January, I will briefly recap. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 13% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. 
Starting in North America, we're on course to open about 40 new stores this year, including the 27 opened during the first 9 months. These openings will include about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with about half being dedicated Men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% this year, driven by Men's.
Turning to China. As you know, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 10 for the balance of fiscal year, bringing the total to about 95 at the end of FY '12. All of these openings will be dual -- gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. 
In Japan, we now expect to open about 10 net new locations with an additional 2 net new stores expected during the fourth quarter. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to 3% last year. 
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets at the beginning of the quarter, we transitioned our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of Singapore last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of our Malaysian domestic retail operations in July, as we have previously announced. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to take control of our Korean domestic retail business from our current distributor Shinsegae International effective in early FY '13. Over the last several years, we have enjoyed an excellent partnership with Shinsegae. They have been instrumental in the development of the Coach brand in Korea, including the opening of several important locations in key department stores in Seoul and in other major cities throughout the country. 
For perspective, our current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail, or about 5% of the $2.4 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 47 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party, duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement. 
It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we have already made in the region utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. In addition, we find these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience.
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have thriving distributor-run businesses in other locations. This year, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. In fact, our first location in Brazil opened earlier this month in Morumbi Shoppings mall to an excellent consumer response. We believe this bodes well for our expansion into other South American countries later this calendar year. 
Touching on Europe, where we're beginning to build a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. This week, we will open a shop-in-shop in Liberty department store and a flagship store on Regent Street. We are continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. 
Second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists, as we build Men's -- as we build brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. In total, we expect to open 11 locations in Europe in FY '12, bringing our total locations to 25 by year end.
In closing, we're energized by the continued pace of change in growth at Coach. We're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our momentum and enable us to realize the many opportunities in front of us. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"

Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our third quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segment, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 18%, and our indirect business rose 10%. As a reminder, the year-ago revenues for both segments were adjusted for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $0.77 as compared to $0.62 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $225 million from $186 million. 
For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $337 million, up 21% from the -- from $280 million reported on a non-GAAP basis in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter expanded 100 basis points to 30.4% compared to 29.4% in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 18% to $818 million from $692 million a year ago, and gross margin rate expanded 100 basis points to 73.8% compared to 72.8% the prior year, driven by both manufacturing cost benefits and new pricing strategies implemented in the quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to hold our expense rate in the third quarter, given the previously discussed impact of the Taiwan transition. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.3% versus 43.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our press release, during the year-ago quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contribution which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the prior year's third quarter was $254 million with a 26.7% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 46.1%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $475 million, up 21% from Q3 last year. This inventory level allows us to support 34 net new North American stores, 10 net new locations in Coach Japan and 30 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our Men's initiatives. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to meet demand this season. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $930 million as compared with $886 million a year ago after the repurchase of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $73.92, spending a total of $172 million, taking our fiscal year date -- year-to-date  total to about $530 million. At the end of the quarter, about $430 million remained in our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $103 million compared with $227 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow from -- in the third quarter was an inflow of $61 million versus $186 million in the same period last year, primarily reflecting the changes in accrued income taxes and charitable donations. 
Our CapEx spending was $41 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
To elaborate on our fourth quarter assumptions, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. This plan includes North America comp sales at least as high as what we generated in the third quarter, as we continue to balance productivity gains with margin improvement. 
Second, we continue to expect gross margin to expand from prior year levels in the fourth quarter, driven by our sourcing initiatives and pricing strategies. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be similar to prior year level.
Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Given that we've been accelerating the transition of distributor-operated wholesale businesses to our direct control, we would expect expenses to slightly outpace top line growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, however, our SG&A expense rate should be similar to FY '11. 
Fourth, and based on the metrics I've just described, we believe that we'll continue to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a full year operating margin slightly ahead of last year's rate of 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our spring results bode well for the future, and we're confident we can continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for participating in on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

And here in the U.S., it's growing on at about a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand. And while our growth on the women's side are equaled to the category, during the last quarter, our overall growth exceeded the over -- the dual-gender growth in premium bags and accessories. So there's a lot of opportunity. First, with regard to Men's, as Mike indicated, our business is on-track to double to over $400 million this year globally, which represents about 8% of our sales. We believe next year, it will be well in excess of 10% of our business. And we are accelerating the introduction of Men's into a much broader range of our full-priced stores and shop-in-shops worldwide. So we're looking to capitalize on the growing category and the strength of the product offering and, of course, our growing brand loyalty in this category. Secondly, and more broadly on the product front, as Mike indicated and we've talked about many times, Bob, the launching of Legacy, which is a global lifestyle brand of concept, which is a dual gender, and we are using that to re-platform our full-priced stores. And we have enormous optimism for what that group is going to do. Mike mentioned our pilots are doing really well, so a combination of Men's and the re-platforming on the women's side to really focus on Legacy. And of course, internationally, we have an enormous opportunity with the much larger role that men's plays in markets such as China to truly establish ourselves as a dual-gender brand. The digital side should also be referenced, Bob. We're so excited about the progress we've made in this last year to harness its power and really give consumers an opportunity to shop wherever they choose to shop. And with our very robust 15 million database in North America, it gives us great, great opportunities."

And what we saw with the all-store discounting is sort of a blanket effect on promotional stance in factory stores. And with the underlying strength in the business coming out of Q2, we really made the determination that we could get away from that and leverage cost savings by being more targeted in a way that we market to our consumer and offer value to the consumer in the factory channel. We still have very strong productivity gains there, strong comps, and we were able to build in margin advantage, taking advantage of the costing opportunities that existed. So we believe that it is long term. We're working it everyday. We continue to probe and test for ideas around how we can play. We realize the factory is a value channel, and we'll continue to be aggressive there. But the early gains for us around margin and maintaining strong productivity are very attractive, and we want to push hard as we move into the fall season to really take advantage of that."

We went back in with the Legacy launch, which is targeted for late July, and we put together a plan in our stores. Lew used the phrase re-platforming to create a real strong visual presence in our stores around marketing and product presentation, using the launch of Legacy as a catalyst. And we identified actually, to be precise, 108 stores that will get what I would call a more supercharged effort around presentation and physical enhancement. Coincidental with that, we also looked at our Men's proposition at 42 stores with shops or more expanded Men's presence and quickly made the leap and said, ""Can we get Men's advanced and expanded in those 100 stores to take advantage of the duality between Legacy, the strength of the women's proposition and putting Men's in at the same time?"" That is all happening as we speak and will be front and center for the Legacy launch. We are, at the same time, looking at the balance of our 250 stores for further opportunity. We are working hard on lease expirations and opportunities for expansion in our primary mall locations. So this will be an ongoing effort. And my sense is that every quarter or every season, we'll have an opportunity to layer in more Men shops as we get deeper into the fleet and as we get more empirical experience on the improved productivity that Men's gives us by adding it to an existing women's store. My goal would be to get a stronger Men's presence in all stores very quickly. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to elaborate further, but we are doing things to bring Men's products closer to our consumers in all stores through technology and other marketing advantages that we have that will continue to probe on in piloting. You'll see us doing more with that in the marketplace very soon as well."

First, I would just reiterate that we're extremely pleased, as Lew mentioned, with our terrific growth in the quarter, which at 60% is similar to the growth that we experienced last quarter, and we remain very much on-target to achieve our target of $300 million, which we announced last October. As Lew also mentioned, there was a shift in the drivers of growth this quarter with more of the sales increase coming from new doors which are performing ahead of our plans. Specifically, what we're seeing in terms of comp within China is increased travel and purchases internationally, especially from the Tier 1 consumers, which would be these consumers from Shanghai, Beijing going more overseas. While the Tier 2 and Tier 3 consumers, these consumers in second and third tier cities, shopping closer to home, driving our non-comp sale. I would remind us that we're now at 32 cities across China, still a very small portion of the 120-or-so cities that have a population of 1 million or more. And indeed, of the 18 locations that we've opened year-to-date in China, 14 have been in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And all but 1 of the locations that we will open this quarter are also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And these are cities that will benefit disproportionately from the growth of the middle class and Chinese government investments in infrastructure. And longer term, as we think about as well the fact that GDP consumption, as a percentage of GDP in China, is at 35% compared with the 70% here in the U.S., of course, these vast majority of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will also be drivers within the longer-term opportunity for us. Specifically, in terms of the models in new stores to the second part of your question, we have the same multichannel strategy in China that we leverage globally, opening up flagship stores, retail stores in shopping mall locations and department stores and factory outlets. And of course, each of these channels are at different levels within different cities. And the opportunity for us is always, first and foremost, to focus on providing the brand with a very good position in each of the markets and then expanding from there. We tend to first open within luxury malls, first and foremost, expanding then to department stores and more bridge or fashion malls as they developed. And the opportunity there is quite massive, as most of these second- and third-tier cities still do not have these locations as they're only on the drawing boards today, and then eventually, of course, into factory outlet malls, which will undoubtedly be a massive opportunity long term within the China market. And they are only now beginning to gain a little bit of traction."

And of the 4 buckets of gross margin you've talked about being easier compares from Japan move to manufacturing out of China, channel mix and China sales growth, what would be the most important of those 4 buckets to take the gross margins higher in the back half and beyond?"

That excludes the 53rd week, and that resulted in the impact of the tsunami. In terms of gross margins, we really view it as multiple initiatives. So obviously, our sourcing initiative is very important to counterbalance labor inflation. Counter sourcing is very important for us on the material side. And gross margin expansion is also very linked to our attractive mix of countries as we grow international, so really a multiple of levers that we're all working at the same time. Some are producing more sometimes, some are producing a little less, and they're growing over time."

We see that as, again, offsetting pressures that exist in the market. So it's really more of trying to maintain our margin rate. The other thing that has really present itself as an opportunity in support of Victor's business is they become more sophisticated in operating in Asia. We're looking at the idea of how do we manufacture in a country to allow -- to take advantage of duty benefits. So as we become a more international global organization, we're finding that the significant opportunity is for us to locate our manufacturing in a place where we can obtain trade benefits, whether it be from Vietnam to Japan, et cetera. So those are the things we're looking for as we move through the future, to continue to give us margin upside and advantages. And the idea that is it just one thing or is it another is really the work that Mike's doing in his channel really complements the work that we're doing on the manufacturing side. So it's really both. And the idea is keeping our margin strong, and we have the strongest margin in the industry. The -- I'll let the over $400 performance, Mike?"

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, including strong sales and earnings growth, as well as operating margin expansion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the Coach brand, our innovative and relevant product offering and our multichannel international distribution model. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future. 
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 24% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.11 billion versus $951 million a year ago, an increase of 17%; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, and now include domestic retail businesses in Singapore and Taiwan, rose 18% to $984 million from $837 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 6.7% from prior year while total North American direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%; fifth, we continued to generate very strong sales growth of nearly 60% and double-digit comps in China, where we remain on course to generate at least $300 million in sales this year; and finally, sales in Japan rose 10% versus prior year in constant currency and rose 14% in dollars. 
In North America during the quarter, we opened one retail store, closed another, while opening 5 factory stores, including 2 Men's factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 full-priced and 162 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to China. We added 5 new locations, all on the Mainland, bringing us to 85 Coach locations at quarter end, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 70 locations on the Mainland in 32 cities. 
And in Japan, 3 locations were opened, all Men's, while 3 were closed. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan. 
Finally, I thought I would briefly mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 6 locations. Five were acquired last July, and we've opened one additional store since. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January. 
Indirect sales rose 10% from prior year to $125 million from $114 million on an -- on a comparable basis. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased while sales at POS in U.S. department stores were modestly below last year's third quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category grew about 10% in the March quarter, consistent with the increases it experienced over the last year. Similarly, Coach's total North American women's bag and accessory business grew at the same rate as the category over the period. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we once again saw continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy, with about 66% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 60% last quarter and 58% a year ago. 
Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. In North America, our total revenues rose 12%, with our directly operated businesses up 13% driven by a 7% comp as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. 
All direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. The primary driver of our retail comp gain was an increase in the overall number of transactions while an increase in average transaction size contributed as well. Overall retail traffic rose as traffic on the Internet continued to gain momentum, with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters. 
Turning to our store channels. Both performed similarly, fueled by average transaction size gains while conversion also rose in retail stores. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales growth. This overall growth rate was similar to our last quarter with a change in composition of the drivers, as distribution was the larger contributor to growth. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent of over 90% among existing customers. 
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some organizational changes, which we put into place over the quarter, to more closely align the leadership of Coach with the needs of our business, both in North America and in our rapidly expanding international markets. These changes will help us leverage our many business opportunities around the world and prepare us to operate efficiently at the scale we envision during our planning horizon. 
First, Mike Tucci has assumed the new role of North American Group President responsible for North American retail, global, digital media and customer engagement and North American wholesale. This will ensure an even more cohesive approach to our brand, merchandising and retail experience wherever our customers choose to shop with us in North America. 
And second, on the international side, Victor Luis has assumed a new role of International Group President responsible for our directly operated retail businesses in Coach Japan, Coach China and Coach Asia and for our wholesale business within Coach international. This will facilitate an even smoother transition of businesses we plan to manage directly in the future, such as Malaysia and Korea. It will create significant synergies as we look to optimize our brand experience in our own directly managed stores, in our distributorships in Coach Europe and in a growing global travel retail market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business and our global product initiative. Mike?"
526573,197120929,287634,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives and our Men's business. As noted in our pr",710,"Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives and our Men's business. 
As noted in our press release, we leveraged the underlying strength in our North American business and implemented a significant shift in our pricing strategy in factory stores during the quarter, as we eliminated in-store couponing across our network. Our new ""no math"" pricing structure provides us with greater marketing flexibility and a more targeted value proposition while enabling us to drive excellent margins. Additionally, our store associates can now devote more time and energy to engagement, sharing product knowledge and building the sale. 
Complementing these in-store strategies, we expanded our e-commerce factory programs. As you know, earlier this fiscal year, we introduced an invitation-only flash-sale site targeted towards our most loyal, factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online, enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores for a limited time period. 
We also began working with a number of small -- of third-party flash sites, targeting their unique databases of value-conscious consumers with the intention of introducing them to Coach factory, which also contributed to our overall comp this quarter. Our early results indicate further opportunity for highly profitable customer acquisition in this value channel. 
Moving on to product. During the third quarter, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view and several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and, most importantly, the Willis, which harkens back to the classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. 
In late February, we focused on Kristin with 4 new styles across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft, feminine colors. At the end of the quarter, we launched Hamptons Weekend, primarily a tote and shoulder bag group, which was also informed by a collection from our archives. 
One of the most exciting product successes we're enjoying is the excellent consumer response to both Willis and Hamptons Weekend on a global level. Both of these groups rooted in classic Coach are precursors to and will be components of a major collection launch this summer called Legacy. 
Also inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring iconic Coach elements, the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection will encompass the complete world of Coach and will be our largest product launch in many years. Early pilots are currently underway and results underscore our confidence in this major initiative. 
The Legacy launch will also drive new merchandising strategies across all retail stores, including presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment and driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key items. 
We're also very excited about the results we're continuing to achieve in our Men's business, which is on track to double again this year to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in Men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. In North America, we see Men's as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. 
Given this success, we're now accelerating the rollout of Men's within existing retail stores. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a broader expression of Men's in nearly 100 Coach retail stores in North America, up from 42 at the end of the third quarter. Outside the U.S. where Men participate in the category at a higher rate, new dual gender and dedicated Men's shops will remain the primary distribution growth vehicles. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the balance of the spring season, given the current sales trends in our retail businesses and the Legacy launch in the seasons ahead. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and other opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have 4 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North American market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
As our distribution plans for the current year haven't changed since our last earnings call in January, I will briefly recap. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 13% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. 
Starting in North America, we're on course to open about 40 new stores this year, including the 27 opened during the first 9 months. These openings will include about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with about half being dedicated Men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% this year, driven by Men's.
Turning to China. As you know, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 10 for the balance of fiscal year, bringing the total to about 95 at the end of FY '12. All of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. 
In Japan, we now expect to open about 10 net new locations with an additional 2 net new stores expected during the fourth quarter. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to 3% last year. 
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets at the beginning of the quarter, we transitioned our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of Singapore last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of our Malaysian domestic retail operations in July, as we have previously announced. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to take control of our Korean domestic retail business from our current distributor, Shinsegae International, effective in early FY '13. Over the last several years, we have enjoyed an excellent partnership with Shinsegae. They have been instrumental in the development of the Coach brand in Korea, including the opening of several important locations in key department stores in Seoul and in other major cities throughout the country. 
For perspective, our current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail, or about 5% of the $2.4 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 47 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party, duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement. 
It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we have already made in the region utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. In addition, we find these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience.
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have thriving distributor-run businesses in other locations. This year, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. In fact, our first location in Brazil opened earlier this month in Morumbi Shoppings mall to an excellent consumer response. We believe this bodes well for our expansion into other South American countries later this calendar year. 
Touching on Europe, where we're beginning to build a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. This week, we will open a shop-in-shop in Liberty department store and a flagship store on Regent Street. We are continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. 
Second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists, as we build Men's -- as we build brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. In total, we expect to open 11 locations in Europe in FY '12, bringing our total locations to 25 by year end.
In closing, we're energized by the continued pace of change in growth at Coach. We're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our momentum and enable us to realize the many opportunities in front of us. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,197120929,287634,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segm",929,"Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our third quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segment, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 18%, and our indirect business rose 10%. As a reminder, the year-ago revenues for both segments were adjusted for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $0.77 as compared to $0.62 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $225 million from $186 million. 
For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $337 million, up 21% from the -- from $280 million reported on a non-GAAP basis in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter expanded 100 basis points to 30.4% compared to 29.4% in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 18% to $818 million from $692 million a year ago, and gross margin rate expanded 100 basis points to 73.8% compared to 72.8% the prior year, driven by both manufacturing cost benefits and new pricing strategies implemented in the quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to hold our expense rate in the third quarter, given the previously discussed impact of the Taiwan transition. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.3% versus 43.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our press release, during the year-ago quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contribution which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the prior year's third quarter was $254 million with a 26.7% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 46.1%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $475 million, up 21% from Q3 last year. This inventory level allows us to support 34 net new North American stores, 10 net new locations in Coach Japan and 30 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our Men's initiatives. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to meet demand this season. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $930 million as compared with $886 million a year ago after the repurchase of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $73.92, spending a total of $172 million, taking our fiscal year date -- year-to-date total to about $530 million. At the end of the quarter, about $430 million remained in our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $103 million compared with $227 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow from -- in the third quarter was an inflow of $61 million versus $186 million in the same period last year, primarily reflecting the changes in accrued income taxes and charitable donations. 
Our CapEx spending was $41 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
To elaborate on our fourth quarter assumptions, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. This plan includes North America comp sales at least as high as what we generated in the third quarter, as we continue to balance productivity gains with margin improvement. 
Second, we continue to expect gross margin to expand from prior year levels in the fourth quarter, driven by our sourcing initiatives and pricing strategies. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be similar to prior year level.
Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Given that we've been accelerating the transition of distributor-operated wholesale businesses to our direct control, we would expect expenses to slightly outpace top line growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, however, our SG&A expense rate should be similar to FY '11. 
Fourth, and based on the metrics I've just described, we believe that we'll continue to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a full year operating margin slightly ahead of last year's rate of 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our spring results bode well for the future, and we're confident we can continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

And here in the U.S., it's growing on at about a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand. And while our growth on the women's side are equaled to the category, during the last quarter, our overall growth exceeded the over -- the dual-gender growth in premium bags and accessories. So there's a lot of opportunity. First, with regard to Men's, as Mike indicated, our business is on-track to double to over $400 million this year globally, which represents about 8% of our sales. We believe next year, it will be well in excess of 10% of our business. And we are accelerating the introduction of Men's into a much broader range of our full-priced stores and shop-in-shops worldwide. So we're looking to capitalize on the growing category and the strength of the product offering and, of course, our growing brand loyalty in this category. Secondly, and more broadly on the product front, as Mike indicated and we've talked about many times, Bob, the launching of Legacy, which is a global lifestyle brand of concept, which is a dual gender, and we are using that to re-platform our full-priced stores. And we have enormous optimism for what that group is going to do. Mike mentioned our pilots are doing really well, so a combination of Men's and the re-platforming on the women's side to really focus on Legacy. And of course, internationally, we have an enormous opportunity with the much larger role that Men's plays in markets such as China to truly establish ourselves as a dual-gender brand. The digital side should also be referenced, Bob. We're so excited about the progress we've made in this last year to harness its power and to really give consumers an opportunity to shop wherever they choose to shop. And with our very robust 15 million database in North America, it gives us great, great opportunities."

And what we saw with the all-store discounting is sort of a blanket effect on promotional stance in factory stores. And with the underlying strength in the business coming out of Q2, we really made the determination that we could get away from that and leverage cost savings by being more targeted in the way that we market to our consumer and offer value to the consumer in the factory channel. We still had very strong productivity gains there, strong comps, and we were able to build in margin advantage, taking advantage of the costing opportunities that existed. So we believe that it is long term. We're working it every day. We continue to probe and test for ideas around how we can play. We realize the factory is a value channel, and we'll continue to be aggressive there. But the early gains for us around margin and maintaining strong productivity are very attractive, and we want to push hard as we move into the fall season to really take advantage of that."

We went back in with the Legacy launch, which is targeted for late July, and we put together a plan in our stores. Lew used the phrase re-platforming to create a real strong visual presence in our stores around marketing and product presentation, using the launch of Legacy as the catalyst. And we identified actually, to be precise, 108 stores that will get what I would call a more supercharged effort around presentation and physical enhancement. Coincidental with that, we also looked at our Men's proposition at 42 stores with shops or more expanded Men's presence and quickly made the leap and said, ""Can we get Men's advanced and expanded in those 100 stores to take advantage of the duality between Legacy, the strength of the women's proposition and putting Men's in at the same time?"" That is all happening as we speak and will be front and center for the Legacy launch. We are, at the same time, looking at the balance of our 250 stores for further opportunity. We are working hard on lease expirations and opportunities for expansion in our primary mall locations. So this will be an ongoing effort. And my sense is that every quarter or every season, we'll have an opportunity to layer in more Men's shops as we get deeper into the fleet and as we get more empirical experience on the improved productivity that Men's gives us by adding it to an existing women's store. My goal would be to get a stronger Men's presence in all stores very quickly. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to elaborate further, but we are doing things to bring Men's products closer to our consumers in all stores through technology and other marketing advantages that we have that we'll continue to probe on in piloting. You'll see us doing more with that in the marketplace very soon as well."

First, I would just reiterate that we're extremely pleased, as Lew mentioned, with our terrific growth in the quarter, which at 60% is similar to the growth that we experienced last quarter, and we remain very much on-target to achieve our target of $300 million, which we announced last October. As Lew also mentioned, there was a shift in the drivers of growth this quarter with more of the sales increase coming from new doors which are performing ahead of our plans. Specifically, what we're seeing in terms of comp within China is increased travel and purchases internationally, especially from the Tier 1 consumers, which would be these consumers from Shanghai, Beijing going more overseas. While the Tier 2 and Tier 3 consumers, these consumers in second and third tier cities, shopping closer to home, driving our non-comp sale. I would remind us that we're now at 32 cities across China, still a very small portion of the 120-or-so cities that have a population of 1 million or more. And indeed, of the 18 locations that we've opened year-to-date in China, 14 have been in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And all but one of the locations that we will open this quarter are also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And these are cities that will benefit disproportionately from the growth of the middle class and Chinese government investments in infrastructure. And longer term, as we think about as well the fact that GDP consumption, as a percentage of GDP in China, is at 35% compared with the 70% here in the U.S., of course, these vast majority of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will also be drivers within the longer-term opportunity for us. Specifically, in terms of the models in new stores to the second part of your question, we have the same multichannel strategy in China that we leverage globally, opening up flagship stores, retail stores in shopping malls, locations in department stores and factory outlets. And of course, each of these channels are at different levels within different cities. And the opportunity for us is always, first and foremost, to focus on providing the brand with a very good position in each of the markets and then expanding from there. We tend to first open within luxury malls, first and foremost, expanding then to department stores and more bridge or fashion malls as they develop. And the opportunity there is quite massive, as most of these second- and third-tier cities still do not have these locations as they're only on the drawing boards today, and then eventually, of course, into factory outlet malls, which will undoubtedly be a massive opportunity long term within the China market. And they are only now beginning to gain a little bit of traction."

Do you see differences in conversion, so forth? And then, I guess, just for Jane. On Japan, can you just remind us how the tsunami impacted the fundamentals of the financials of Japan last year? And of the 4 buckets of gross margin you've talked about being easier compares from Japan move to manufacturing out of China, channel mix and China sales growth, what would be the most important of those 4 buckets to take the gross margins higher in the back half and beyond?"

That excludes the 53rd week, and that was all due to the impact of the tsunami. In terms of gross margins, we really view it as multiple initiatives. So obviously, our sourcing initiative is very important to counterbalance labor inflation. Counter sourcing is very important for us on the material side. And gross margin expansion is also very linked to our attractive mix of countries as we grow international. There are really a multiple of levers that we're all working at the same time. Some are producing more sometimes, some are producing a little less, and they're growing over time."

We see that as, again, offsetting pressures that exist in the market. So it's really more of trying to maintain our margin rate. The other thing that has really presented itself as an opportunity in support of Victor's business is they become more sophisticated in operating in Asia. We're looking at the idea of how do we manufacture in a country to allow -- to take advantage of duty benefits. So as we become a more international global organization, we're finding that the significant opportunity is for us to locate our manufacturing in a place where we can obtain trade benefits, whether it be from Vietnam to Japan, et cetera. So those are things we're looking for as we move to the future, to continue to give us margin upside and advantages. And the idea that is it just one thing or is it another, it's really the work that Mike's doing in his channel really complements the work that we're doing on the manufacturing side.

As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, including strong sales and earnings growth, as well as operating margin expansion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the Coach brand, our innovative and relevant product offering and our multichannel international distribution model. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future. 
While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 24% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.11 billion versus $951 million a year ago, an increase of 17%; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, and now include domestic retail businesses in Singapore and Taiwan, rose 18% to $984 million from $837 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 6.7% from prior year while total North American direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%; fifth, we continued to generate very strong sales growth of nearly 60% and double-digit comps in China, where we remain on course to generate at least $300 million in sales this year; and finally, sales in Japan rose 10% versus prior year in constant currency and rose 14% in dollars. 
In North America during the quarter, we opened one retail store, closed another, while opening 5 factory stores, including 2 Men's factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 full-priced and 162 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to China. We added 5 new locations, all on the Mainland, bringing us to 85 Coach locations at quarter end, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 70 locations on the Mainland in 32 cities. 
And in Japan, 3 locations were opened, all Men's, while 3 were closed. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan. 
Finally, I thought I would briefly mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 6 locations. Five were acquired last July, and we've opened one additional store since. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January. 
Indirect sales rose 10% from prior year to $125 million from $114 million on an -- on a comparable basis. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased while sales at POS in U.S. department stores were modestly below last year's third quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category grew about 10% in the March quarter, consistent with the increases it experienced over the last year. Similarly, Coach's total North American women's bag and accessory business grew at the same rate as the category over the period. 
Separately, it's worth noting that we once again saw continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy, with about 66% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 60% last quarter and 58% a year ago. 
Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. In North America, our total revenues rose 12%, with our directly operated businesses up 13% driven by a 7% comp as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. 
All direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. The primary driver of our retail comp gain was an increase in the overall number of transactions while an increase in average transaction size contributed as well. Overall retail traffic rose as traffic on the Internet continued to gain momentum, with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters. 
Turning to our store channels. Both performed similarly, fueled by average transaction size gains while conversion also rose in retail stores. 
As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales growth. This overall growth rate was similar to our last quarter with a change in composition of the drivers, as distribution was the larger contributor to growth. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent of over 90% among existing customers. 
While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some organizational changes, which we put into place over the quarter, to more closely align the leadership of Coach with the needs of our business, both in North America and in our rapidly expanding international markets. These changes will help us leverage our many business opportunities around the world and prepare us to operate efficiently at the scale we envision during our planning horizon. 
First, Mike Tucci has assumed the new role of North American Group President responsible for North American retail, global, digital media and customer engagement and North American wholesale. This will ensure an even more cohesive approach to our brand, merchandising and retail experience wherever our customers choose to shop with us in North America. 
And second, on the international side, Victor Luis has assumed a new role of International Group President responsible for our directly operated retail businesses in Coach Japan, Coach China and Coach Asia and for our wholesale business within Coach international. This will facilitate an even smoother transition of businesses we plan to manage directly in the future, such as Malaysia and Korea. It will create significant synergies as we look to optimize our brand experience in our own directly managed stores, in our distributorships in Coach Europe and in a growing global travel retail market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business and our global product initiative. Mike?"
526573,197120929,287691,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives and our Men's business. As noted in our pr",710,"Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives and our Men's business. 
As noted in our press release, we leveraged the underlying strength in our North American business and implemented a significant shift in our pricing strategy in factory stores during the quarter, as we eliminated in-store couponing across our network. Our new ""no math"" pricing structure provides us with greater marketing flexibility and a more targeted value proposition while enabling us to drive excellent margins. Additionally, our store associates can now devote more time and energy to engagement, sharing product knowledge and building the sale. 
Complementing these in-store strategies, we expanded our e-commerce factory programs. As you know, earlier this fiscal year, we introduced an invitation-only flash-sale site targeted towards our most loyal, factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online, enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores for a limited time period. 
We also began working with a number of small -- of third-party flash sites, targeting their unique databases of value-conscious consumers with the intention of introducing them to Coach factory, which also contributed to our overall comp this quarter. Our early results indicate further opportunity for highly profitable customer acquisition in this value channel. 
Moving on to product. During the third quarter, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view and several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and, most importantly, the Willis, which harkens back to the classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. 
In late February, we focused on Kristin with 4 new styles across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft, feminine colors. At the end of the quarter, we launched Hamptons Weekend, primarily a tote and shoulder bag group, which was also informed by a collection from our archives. 
One of the most exciting product successes we're enjoying is the excellent consumer response to both Willis and Hamptons Weekend on a global level. Both of these groups rooted in classic Coach are precursors to and will be components of a major collection launch this summer called Legacy. 
Also inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring iconic Coach elements, the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection will encompass the complete world of Coach and will be our largest product launch in many years. Early pilots are currently underway and results underscore our confidence in this major initiative. 
The Legacy launch will also drive new merchandising strategies across all retail stores, including presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment and driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key items. 
We're also very excited about the results we're continuing to achieve in our Men's business, which is on track to double again this year to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in Men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. In North America, we see Men's as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. 
Given this success, we're now accelerating the rollout of Men's within existing retail stores. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a broader expression of Men's in nearly 100 Coach retail stores in North America, up from 42 at the end of the third quarter. Outside the U.S. where Men participate in the category at a higher rate, new dual gender and dedicated Men's shops will remain the primary distribution growth vehicles. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the balance of the spring season, given the current sales trends in our retail businesses and the Legacy launch in the seasons ahead. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and other opportunities for growth. Lew?"

As most of you know, we have 4 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North American market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
As our distribution plans for the current year haven't changed since our last earnings call in January, I will briefly recap. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 13% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. 
Starting in North America, we're on course to open about 40 new stores this year, including the 27 opened during the first 9 months. These openings will include about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with about half being dedicated Men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% this year, driven by Men's.
Turning to China. As you know, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 10 for the balance of fiscal year, bringing the total to about 95 at the end of FY '12. All of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. 
In Japan, we now expect to open about 10 net new locations with an additional 2 net new stores expected during the fourth quarter. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to 3% last year. 
Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets at the beginning of the quarter, we transitioned our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of Singapore last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of our Malaysian domestic retail operations in July, as we have previously announced. 
In addition, as noted in our press release, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to take control of our Korean domestic retail business from our current distributor, Shinsegae International, effective in early FY '13. Over the last several years, we have enjoyed an excellent partnership with Shinsegae. They have been instrumental in the development of the Coach brand in Korea, including the opening of several important locations in key department stores in Seoul and in other major cities throughout the country. 
For perspective, our current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail, or about 5% of the $2.4 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 47 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party, duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement. 
It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we have already made in the region utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. In addition, we find these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience.
Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have thriving distributor-run businesses in other locations. This year, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. In fact, our first location in Brazil opened earlier this month in Morumbi Shoppings mall to an excellent consumer response. We believe this bodes well for our expansion into other South American countries later this calendar year. 
Touching on Europe, where we're beginning to build a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. This week, we will open a shop-in-shop in Liberty department store and a flagship store on Regent Street. We are continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. 
Second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists, as we build Men's -- as we build brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. In total, we expect to open 11 locations in Europe in FY '12, bringing our total locations to 25 by year end.
In closing, we're energized by the continued pace of change in growth at Coach. We're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our momentum and enable us to realize the many opportunities in front of us. 
At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?"
526573,197120929,287691,"Coach, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our third quarter results. As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segm",929,"Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our third quarter results. 
As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segment, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 18%, and our indirect business rose 10%. As a reminder, the year-ago revenues for both segments were adjusted for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $0.77 as compared to $0.62 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $225 million from $186 million. 
For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $337 million, up 21% from the -- from $280 million reported on a non-GAAP basis in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter expanded 100 basis points to 30.4% compared to 29.4% in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 18% to $818 million from $692 million a year ago, and gross margin rate expanded 100 basis points to 73.8% compared to 72.8% the prior year, driven by both manufacturing cost benefits and new pricing strategies implemented in the quarter. 
Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to hold our expense rate in the third quarter, given the previously discussed impact of the Taiwan transition. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.3% versus 43.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our press release, during the year-ago quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contribution which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the prior year's third quarter was $254 million with a 26.7% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 46.1%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $475 million, up 21% from Q3 last year. This inventory level allows us to support 34 net new North American stores, 10 net new locations in Coach Japan and 30 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our Men's initiatives. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to meet demand this season. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $930 million as compared with $886 million a year ago after the repurchase of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $73.92, spending a total of $172 million, taking our fiscal year date -- year-to-date total to about $530 million. At the end of the quarter, about $430 million remained in our current repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $103 million compared with $227 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow from -- in the third quarter was an inflow of $61 million versus $186 million in the same period last year, primarily reflecting the changes in accrued income taxes and charitable donations. 
Our CapEx spending was $41 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. 
We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
To elaborate on our fourth quarter assumptions, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. This plan includes North America comp sales at least as high as what we generated in the third quarter, as we continue to balance productivity gains with margin improvement. 
Second, we continue to expect gross margin to expand from prior year levels in the fourth quarter, driven by our sourcing initiatives and pricing strategies. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be similar to prior year level.
Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Given that we've been accelerating the transition of distributor-operated wholesale businesses to our direct control, we would expect expenses to slightly outpace top line growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, however, our SG&A expense rate should be similar to FY '11. 
Fourth, and based on the metrics I've just described, we believe that we'll continue to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a full year operating margin slightly ahead of last year's rate of 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our spring results bode well for the future, and we're confident we can continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Thank you all for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew."

And here in the U.S., it's growing on at about a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand. And while our growth on the women's side are equaled to the category, during the last quarter, our overall growth exceeded the over -- the dual-gender growth in premium bags and accessories. So there's a lot of opportunity. First, with regard to Men's, as Mike indicated, our business is on-track to double to over $400 million this year globally, which represents about 8% of our sales. We believe next year, it will be well in excess of 10% of our business. And we are accelerating the introduction of Men's into a much broader range of our full-priced stores and shop-in-shops worldwide. So we're looking to capitalize on the growing category and the strength of the product offering and, of course, our growing brand loyalty in this category. Secondly, and more broadly on the product front, as Mike indicated and we've talked about many times, Bob, the launching of Legacy, which is a global lifestyle brand of concept, which is a dual gender, and we are using that to re-platform our full-priced stores. And we have enormous optimism for what that group is going to do. Mike mentioned our pilots are doing really well, so a combination of Men's and the re-platforming on the women's side to really focus on Legacy. And of course, internationally, we have an enormous opportunity with the much larger role that Men's plays in markets such as China to truly establish ourselves as a dual-gender brand. The digital side should also be referenced, Bob. We're so excited about the progress we've made in this last year to harness its power and to really give consumers an opportunity to shop wherever they choose to shop. And with our very robust 15 million database in North America, it gives us great, great opportunities."

And what we saw with the all-store discounting is sort of a blanket effect on promotional stance in factory stores. And with the underlying strength in the business coming out of Q2, we really made the determination that we could get away from that and leverage cost savings by being more targeted in the way that we market to our consumer and offer value to the consumer in the factory channel. We still had very strong productivity gains there, strong comps, and we were able to build in margin advantage, taking advantage of the costing opportunities that existed. So we believe that it is long term. We're working it every day. We continue to probe and test for ideas around how we can play. We realize the factory is a value channel, and we'll continue to be aggressive there. But the early gains for us around margin and maintaining strong productivity are very attractive, and we want to push hard as we move into the fall season to really take advantage of that."

We went back in with the Legacy launch, which is targeted for late July, and we put together a plan in our stores. Lew used the phrase re-platforming to create a real strong visual presence in our stores around marketing and product presentation, using the launch of Legacy as the catalyst. And we identified actually, to be precise, 108 stores that will get what I would call a more supercharged effort around presentation and physical enhancement. Coincidental with that, we also looked at our Men's proposition at 42 stores with shops or more expanded Men's presence and quickly made the leap and said, ""Can we get Men's advanced and expanded in those 100 stores to take advantage of the duality between Legacy, the strength of the women's proposition and putting Men's in at the same time?"" That is all happening as we speak and will be front and center for the Legacy launch. We are, at the same time, looking at the balance of our 250 stores for further opportunity. We are working hard on lease expirations and opportunities for expansion in our primary mall locations. So this will be an ongoing effort. And my sense is that every quarter or every season, we'll have an opportunity to layer in more Men's shops as we get deeper into the fleet and as we get more empirical experience on the improved productivity that Men's gives us by adding it to an existing women's store. My goal would be to get a stronger Men's presence in all stores very quickly. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to elaborate further, but we are doing things to bring Men's products closer to our consumers in all stores through technology and other marketing advantages that we have that we'll continue to probe on in piloting.

First, I would just reiterate that we're extremely pleased, as Lew mentioned, with our terrific growth in the quarter, which at 60% is similar to the growth that we experienced last quarter, and we remain very much on-target to achieve our target of $300 million, which we announced last October. As Lew also mentioned, there was a shift in the drivers of growth this quarter with more of the sales increase coming from new doors which are performing ahead of our plans. Specifically, what we're seeing in terms of comp within China is increased travel and purchases internationally, especially from the Tier 1 consumers, which would be these consumers from Shanghai, Beijing going more overseas. While the Tier 2 and Tier 3 consumers, these consumers in second and third tier cities, shopping closer to home, driving our non-comp sale. I would remind us that we're now at 32 cities across China, still a very small portion of the 120-or-so cities that have a population of 1 million or more. And indeed, of the 18 locations that we've opened year-to-date in China, 14 have been in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And all but one of the locations that we will open this quarter are also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And these are cities that will benefit disproportionately from the growth of the middle class and Chinese government investments in infrastructure. And longer term, as we think about as well the fact that GDP consumption, as a percentage of GDP in China, is at 35% compared with the 70% here in the U.S., of course, these vast majority of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will also be drivers within the longer-term opportunity for us. Specifically, in terms of the models in new stores to the second part of your question, we have the same multichannel strategy in China that we leverage globally, opening up flagship stores, retail stores in shopping malls, locations in department stores and factory outlets. And of course, each of these channels are at different levels within different cities. And the opportunity for us is always, first and foremost, to focus on providing the brand with a very good position in each of the markets and then expanding from there. We tend to first open within luxury malls, first and foremost, expanding then to department stores and more bridge or fashion malls as they develop. And the opportunity there is quite massive, as most of these second- and third-tier cities still do not have these locations as they're only on the drawing boards today, and then eventually, of course, into factory outlet malls, which will undoubtedly be a massive opportunity long term within the China market. And they are only now beginning to gain a little bit of traction."

That excludes the 53rd week, and that was all due to the impact of the tsunami. In terms of gross margins, we really view it as multiple initiatives. So obviously, our sourcing initiative is very important to counterbalance labor inflation. Counter sourcing is very important for us on the material side. And gross margin expansion is also very linked to our attractive mix of countries as we grow international. There are really a multiple of levers that we're all working at the same time. Some are producing more sometimes, some are producing a little less, and they're growing over time."

We see that as, again, offsetting pressures that exist in the market. So it's really more of trying to maintain our margin rate. The other thing that has really presented itself as an opportunity in support of Victor's business is they become more sophisticated in operating in Asia. We're looking at the idea of how do we manufacture in a country to allow -- to take advantage of duty benefits. So as we become a more international global organization, we're finding that the significant opportunity is for us to locate our manufacturing in a place where we can obtain trade benefits, whether it be from Vietnam to Japan, et cetera. So those are things we're looking for as we move to the future, to continue to give us margin upside and advantages.

As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We're als",2683,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We're also very pleased with profitability levels in both the quarter and the year, as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvements. We continued to diversify our supply chain, expanding our manufacturing base globally. Importantly, we made significant progress on all of our growth initiatives.
Moving on to some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '12 was highlighted by increases of 15% in revenue, 17% in operating income and 21% in earnings per share. It was a year of several milestones. First, we continued to leverage the international opportunity for Coach, growing organically through distribution and productivity while accelerating the acquisition of key Asian domestic businesses to our direct control. In China, Coach sales exceeded  $300 million, up 64%, ending the year with nearly 100 locations. 
Second, our Men's business doubled in FY '12 to over $400 million, as we continue to open dedicated stand-alone and dual-gender locations globally, while also rolling out a broader expression of men's to nearly 1/3 of our North American retail stores by year end.  Third, we successfully expanded our digital initiative, driving double-digit online sales growth, while also exploring new ways to communicate with our consumer and grow our database.  And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 1/3, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. 
This annual performance was capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Some key metrics were first, net sales totaled $1.16 billion, an increase of 12%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.86, up 27% from the $0.68 in the prior year. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 2% on a comparable basis from prior year, while North American total direct sales rose 7%. Fourth, China sales rose 60% as we continue to generate distribution growth and significant double-digit comps in China. And finally, sales in Japan rose 18% in dollars and 16% in constant currency, anniversary-ing the 2011 impact of the earthquake and tsunami. 
During the fourth quarter, we opened 4 net new North American retail stores while also opening 7 factory stores including 5 dedicated Men's stores. At the end of FY '12, there were 354 full priced and 169 factory stores in operation in North America. This was an increase of 9 full priced stores including 3 Men's retail stores, as well as 26 factory stores including 16 Men's stores from the end of FY '11. Total square footage grew 10% for the year. In addition, as forecasted in our third quarter conference call, we accelerated the rollout of a broader expression of Men to an additional 50 locations in Q4. Therefore at year end in North America, there were 39 Men's stand-alone factory stores, 50 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops -- I'm sorry, 5 stand-alone Men's retail stores and -- over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops.
Moving to China, during the quarter, we added 11 net new locations, 9 net on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 96 Coach locations in China, including 79 locations on the Mainland in 36 cities. Additionally, there were 14 locations in Hong Kong and 3 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 30 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 58%. 
In Japan, 3 locations were added, 2 Men's retail locations and a factory store. At year end, there were 187 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone full priced stores including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 35 factory stores and 7 duty-free locations. In total, a net of 11 locations were added in Japan during FY '12 and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 6%. 
Finally, I wanted to mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 7 locations. 5 are acquired last July, and we've opened 2 additional stores during the fiscal year. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January and opened a new store this quarter. Shortly after the fiscal year ended, we acquired our domestic businesses in Malaysia, which included 10 locations generating annual sales of about $30 million at retail.
Indirect sales, which represent about 11% of Coach's sales annually, were even with prior year on a comparable basis, adjusting for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Sales were driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores declined as we continue to tightly manage inventory in this channel given retail sales trends. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and same-location sales gains. While in U.S. department stores, sales decreased automatically on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's North American handbag and accessories category grow at least 10% in FY '12. Coach continue to participate in the market growth, performing similarly in our own direct channels. As you know, we're also continuing to drive our Men's business in North America through new stand-alone and dual-gender or side-by-side stores and by dedicating more space for a broader Men's assortment in existing retail stores. In FY '12, Coach's sales of Men's accessories doubled in North America, driving the overall Men's premium category, which grew about 25% to nearly $800 million.
Over the fourth quarter, the economic backdrop in the U.S. clearly softened as consumer confidence and sentiment declined. However, our research shows that our customers' intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumer surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. Our revenues in North America rose 5% with our directly operated businesses up 7%, driven by a 2% comp. As noted in our press release, an increasingly promotional environment in North America led to slower growth than expected in factory stores, which was entirely responsible for the change in the overall retail comp trend from last -- from the prior quarter. As a result, we responded by reinstating our prior practice of in-store couponing in a cross-section of factory locations late in the period. It's important to note that we had significant pricing flexibility and a variety of marketing levers available to us in this channel, which allows us to balance productivity gains and margin improvement.
The primary driver of our overall retail comp gain was an increase in average transaction size. The trends in our full priced stores and overall e-commerce channels were consistent with the prior quarter. Our factory store comp was impacted by the elimination of in-store couponing throughout most of the quarter and also by slowing traffic to factory malls. 
Outside of North America, we saw very strong growth in our international markets. We achieved our strongest top line growth in China, which remains our largest geographic opportunity, given both the size of the market and rate of growth. During the fourth quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% year-over-year, consistent with the prior quarter and fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales growth. As I noted up front, this took our full year sales to over $300 million, up over 60%. 
For the quarter, as mentioned, we posted a 16% increase in local currency in Japan and an 18% gain in dollars. As we anniversary the impact of last year's earthquake, Japan is a mature markets where we are focusing on the Men's opportunity and gaining share in the women's category.
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and newness, with the launch of the Hamptons Weekend collection introduced in April and update to Poppy and Madison throughout the quarter. Looking forward, we're excited about the distinctive new look you will see in our stores with the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collections, which is being introduced over the next month globally. Inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring distinctive Coach elements, it is our largest product launch in many years. This iconic collection provides a new foundation for the brand, targeting multi-generational consumers who are more both classic and stylish in their preferences. As we've discussed, the Legacy launch is driving new merchandising strategies including: first, presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves; second, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful story environment; and thirdly, driving major stories in handbag and accessories to highlight key items.
In support of the launch, we're rolling out new visual merchandising enhancements to about 100 of our leading stores in North America as well as key international locations. This is providing a vibrant new backdrop for the collection, driving consumer interest. Legacy launched in North America just about 10 days ago. So with only a week's worth of sales results, we can tell you that we are pleased with the collection's performance. Thus far, the duffel and the canvas carry all are the top handbag styles as planned. The vibrant colors are being very well received in both handbags and women's accessories, and prints and fashion styles are best sellers. Of course, we plan to support Legacy through a greater investment in integrated marketing communications, featuring bold new creative across print, digital and outsource. These major marketing initiatives are timed to coincide with the publication of the September fashion books when they drop in mid-August. 
Naturally, I also want to update you on Men's, a key global initiative. As mentioned, Men's doubled again in FY '12 to over $400 million globally. And we're experiencing success across all concepts and store types including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. Outside of the U.S. with the male consumer tends to be more style conscious, we've also opened a number of Men's dedicated stores as well as dual-gender stores. At the end of the year, an expanded assortment of Men's was available in about half of our directly-operated Coach locations globally as well as in many key distributor-operated locations.
This performance underscores our confidence in Men's as a significant growth driver for Coach. We continue to believe it will continue -- it will contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we the FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged: first, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and product -- productivity gains; second, continuing to build our women's business in the North American market; third, tapping into the large and now rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. Starting with the distribution, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '13, consistent with last year. Beginning in North America, we will open at least 30 new stores in FY '13 including about 10 new full price locations and at least 20 factory outlets, of which about 10 will be Men's stores. One of these new full price locations will be a concession shop-in-shop at Macy's Square opening early this fall, the first of its kind for Coach in the U.S. We're very excited about this important department store location, which will feature a flagship face, designed for us by renowned architect Rem who will also be designing our Multi flagship in Tokyo next spring. In addition, we are planning to expand about 20 locations, 5 full price and 15 factory, to create side-by-side stores with a separate entrance and dedicated Men's shops. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of at least 10% this year, similar to last year, driven by our expanding Men's business.
Turning to China. As you know, we're committed to open -- opening about 30 new locations a year. Finding the right people to manage and staff our stores to provide the right Coach in-store experience constrains us from more rapid distribution growth. In FY '13, we again expect to open about 30 new stores, bringing the total to around 125 locations at the end of the year. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35% in FY '13. And we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and comparable-location sales.
In terms of our other direct markets of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, our primary focus is driving productivity as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments and systems, creating a brand-right experience. This will also be true of Korea, where we are acquiring the domestic retail business from our current distributor within the next few days. As a reminder, Coach's current annual sales in Korea are about $121 million, including global travel retail or about 5% of the $2.6 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 48 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korea travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains challenging and the category continues to be fairly stagnant, although fully back to pre-earthquake levels. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 10 net new locations in Japan, most of them dedicated Men's doors. We are also particularly excited about our 5,000 square foot multi flagship, scheduled to open next spring. In total, we expected net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12. 
Finally, beyond our directly owned international -- directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. Brazil, Kuwait and Vietnam were all new markets for Coach in FY '12. Finally, beyond our directly owned businesses in Asia, we're focusing on expanding through distributor partners in 3 regions: first, other emerging markets in Asia such as Vietnam and Indonesia; second, Latin America including Brazil, Venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Chile and Peru; and third, the Middle East where Kuwait has been our newest addition. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that continues to exist for Coach. 
Touching on Europe, we begun to build the foundation for long-term growth with 25 locations across the U.K., France, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. First in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. We had 5 locations opened at the end of FY '12 including 2 London flagships. We're continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. Second in France, where we are partners with Printemps, we've opened 9 locations to date. Importantly, our Key Boulevard health women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist as we build our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. Altogether, we expect to add about 5 locations in Europe during FY '13. 
I've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace, giving -- given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in North America which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus our men's and digital provide additional opportunities for growth.  At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"

with prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 24% and totaled $251 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.86 up 27%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 15%, totaling $4.76 billion. We saw leverage to the bottom line with earnings per share at $3.53, up 21% and net income of $1.04 billion, up 18%. For the quarter, operating income totaled $371 million on a non-GAAP basis, 19% above the $312 million reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.1% versus 30.3% for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit rose 13% to $838 million from -- $741 million recorded a year ago while gross margin was 72.6% versus 71.8%, primarily due to channel mix and sourcing cost improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.5% compared to -- 41.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 100 basis points of leverage in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L. 
During the quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contributions, which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was $352 million with a 30.4% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 42.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, operating income totaled $1.55 billion, 17% above the $1.33 billion reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.6% versus 32.0%. For the year, gross profit rose 15% to -- $3.47 billion from $3.02 billion a year ago. As expected, gross margin was 72.8% versus 72.7%. SG&A expenses as percentage of net sales totaled 40.2%, compared to the 40.7% reported in fiscal 2011. 
During both FY '12 and FY '11, we recorded certain items including the favorable tax settlements. As a result and in both years, we made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefits of these tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fiscal year 2012 was $1.51 billion with a 31.7% margin and in SG&A expense ratio of 41.0%. This compared to fiscal year 2011 operating income of $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis with an operating margin of 31.4% and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.3%. 
moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $504 million, up 19.6% from FY '11 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support distribution growth and to maximize sales this summer and fall. Cash and short-term investments stood at $917 million, 31% above the $702 million a year ago, after $700 million of share repurchases in the interim 12 month. 
During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 2.5 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $57.79, spending a total of $169 million At the end of the year, 262 million remained under our present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $283 million, compared to $221 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $210 million, versus $164 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $73 million versus $57 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2012, net cash from operating activities was $1.2 billion, compared to $1 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '12 was an inflow of $1 billion versus $886 million in fiscal year '11. 
CapEx spending totaled $184 million for the year compared to $148 million in the prior year. It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '13, we expect that our CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansion across all geographies, elevating our store environment within our existing stores and investments in technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Consistent with our practice over the past several years, we're not giving guidance for FY '13. We are mindful of balancing the impact of a muted consumer environment in North America and the softening global macroeconomic outlook, with our optimism around the launch of Legacy, Men's growth and a strong international expansion opportunities for Coach. As noted, FY '13 will be an investment year for us as we amplify our actions to drive the long-term growth. Our most significant investment is accelerating our international growth due to the acquisition of domestic retail operation of our key Asian distributors and a further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. 
In FY '13, we will also our investments in the digital space to expand and deepen our engagement with consumer. In addition, we will increase our marketing spend toward strengthening our brand positioning with distinctive new product and elevated store environment across all channels and geographies. Some of these initiatives will be in the form of CapEx as I mentioned, while others will result in higher operating expenses, such as those associated with the transition of the Asia retail businesses including Taiwan, which we won't anniversary until January 2013; and the Malaysia and Korea, which are being acquired in Q1. So while our core businesses are expected to continue to deliver modest operating leverage, we expect that together, these investments, along with increased brand supports, will result in some deleverage in FY '13 while providing a platform to accelerate our earnings growth in the year and beyond.
Therefore, when you're thinking about the year, keep in mind the following: first and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our sales will be driven in part by low to mid-single-digit comps in North America where our comparisons will be more difficult in the first half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a headwind early in the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. 
Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points. In addition, the in-store enhancements and marketing programs for Legacy will have a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. 
Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage. 
And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we further refine our international tax strategies. Therefore, when you're modeling out the quarters, I would like you to remember the the first quarter will be the most challenging in terms of both top line as we're up against very strong North American comp and a larger currency benefit, and bottom line due to the disproportionate impact of the investments and brand spend.
In summary, FY '12 was an excellent year, demonstrating our ability to manage our business and links while advancing our key growth initiative. We're accelerating our distribution plan to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies and capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally. Most importantly, our goals are unchanged. We remained committed to achieving double-digit top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generate significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholders. I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

remain steady. We did see a change in run rate in factory. And what we saw was the success of our pricing strategy in Q3 against a less promotional environment. Where more robust traffic trends were successful, we were able to maintain higher rates and productivity and comps. And that changed late in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the more promotional environment in factory. And we saw change in the factory tempo in terms of traffic levels in factory stores. We responded to it. We took action. We pushed a stronger value message into our stores. We advanced our signage and presentation programs in the stores to show a more pronounced level of newness and value, and we continue to do that as we enter into July. And the learning for us is that as we see a more promotional environment, as we are up against a heavier promotional cadence in factory stores, we have to be nimble. We have to use a variety of levers in terms of messaging and pricing, and we have to run the business for a balance of sales productivity and margin improvement.

We mentioned the category grew by about 25% this year here in the United States, and the majority of that growth came from Coach.

First, there was a overall decline in the rate of traffic later in the quarter, and this is -- transcends Coach but as it impacted us, particularly in June. And what we saw among other retailers starting really in May was an intensification of their promotional activities including the perennial in-store coupon to drive decisional shopping. So we do see what occurred in our fleet late in the quarter heavily driven by the macroenvironment. And as Mike said, we were up against a very strong promotional activities last year. In terms of our product, certainly, product is a factor. We actually introduced a strong platform in the second half of June. We sent from our full price Kristin and that coupled with the reinstatement of coupons, reinvigorated factory performance. We believe that when we look at factory bricks and mortar, both on digital as channel, that we have huge opportunities to drive additional factory sales. That is basically buying discontinued or made-for-factory product at a discount. And the appetite, of course, among consumers to buy product at a discount is insatiable and growing."

As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We were also very pleased with profitability levels in both the quarter and year, as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. We continued to diversify our supply chain, expanding our manufacturing base globally. Importantly, we made significant progress on all of our growth initiatives.
Moving on to some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '12 was highlighted by increases of 15% in revenue, 17% in operating income and 21% in earnings per share. It was a year of several milestones. first, we continued to leverage the international opportunity for Coach, growing organically through distribution and productivity while accelerating the acquisition of key Asian domestic businesses to our direct control. In China, Coach sales exceeded  $300 million, up 64%, ending the year with nearly 100 locations. Second, our Men's business doubled in FY '12 to over $400 million, as we continue to open dedicated stand-alone and dual-gender locations globally, while also rolling out a broader expression of men's to nearly 1/3 of our North American retail stores by year end. Third, we successfully expanded our digital initiative, driving double-digit online sales growth, while also exploring new ways to communicate with our consumer and grow our database. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 1/3, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. 
This annual performance was capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.16 billion, an increase of 12%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.86, up 27% from the $0.68 in the prior year. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 2% on a comparable basis from prior year, while North American total direct sales rose 7%. Fourth, China sales rose 60% as we continue to generate distribution growth and significant double-digit comps in China. And finally, sales in Japan rose 18% in dollars and 16% in constant currency, anniversarying the 2011 impact of the earthquake and tsunami. 
During the fourth quarter, we opened 4 net new North American retail stores while also opening 7 factory stores, including 5 dedicated Men's stores. At the end of FY '12, there were 354 Full Price and 169 factory stores in operation in North America. This was an increase of 9 Full Price stores, including 3 Men's retail stores, as well as 26 factory stores including 16 Men's stores from the end of FY '11. 
Total square footage grew 10% for the year. In addition, as forecasted in our third quarter conference call, we accelerated the rollout of a broader expression of Men to an additional 50 locations in Q4. Therefore, at year end in North America, there were 30 Men's stand-alone factory stores, 50 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops -- I'm sorry, 5 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops.
Moving to China. During the quarter, we added 11 net new locations, 9 net on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 96 Coach locations in China, including 79 locations on the Mainland and 36 cities. Additionally, there were 14 locations in Hong Kong and 3 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 30 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 58%. 
In Japan, 3 locations were added, 2 Men's retail locations and a factory store. At year end, there were 187 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 35 factory stores and 7 duty free locations. In total, a net of 11 locations were added in Japan during FY '12 and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 6%. 
Finally, I wanted to mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 7 locations. 5 were acquired last July, and we've opened 2 additional stores during the fiscal year. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January and opened a new store this quarter. Shortly after the fiscal year ended, we acquired our domestic businesses in Malaysia, which included 10 locations, generating annual sales of about $30 million at retail.
Indirect sales, which represent about 11% of Coach's sales annually, were even with prior year on a comparable basis, adjusting for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Sales were driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores declined as we continue to tightly manage inventory in this channel given retail sales trends. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and same-location sales gains. While in U.S. department stores, sales decreased moderately on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category grew at least 10% in FY '12. Coach continue to participate in the market growth, performing similarly in our own direct channels. As you know, we're also continuing to drive our Men's business in North America through new stand-alone and dual-gender or side-by-side stores and by dedicating more space for a broader Men's assortment in existing retail stores. In FY '12, Coach's sales of Men's bags and accessories doubled in North America, driving the overall Men's premium category, which grew about 25% to nearly $800 million.
Over the fourth quarter, the economic backdrop in the U.S. clearly softened as consumer confidence and sentiment declined. However, our research shows that our customers' intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our revenues in North America rose 5% with our directly operated businesses up 7%, driven by a 2% comp. As noted in our press release, an increasingly promotional environment in North America led to slower growth than expected in factory stores, which was entirely responsible for the change in the overall retail comp trend from last -- from the prior quarter. As a result, we responded by reinstating our prior practice of in-store couponing in a cross section of factory locations late in the period. It's important to note that we have significant pricing flexibility and a variety of marketing levers available to us in this channel, which allows us to balance productivity gains and margin improvement.
The primary driver of our overall retail comp gain was an increase in average transaction size. The trends in our Full Price stores and overall e-commerce channels were consistent with the prior quarter. Our factory store comp was impacted by the elimination of in-store couponing throughout most of the quarter and also by slowing traffic to factory malls. 
Outside of North America, we saw very strong growth in our international markets. We achieved our strongest top line growth in China, which remains our largest geographic opportunity, given both the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the fourth quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% year-over-year, consistent with the prior quarter and fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales growth. As I noted upfront, this took our full year sales to over $300 million, up over 60%. 
For the quarter, as mentioned, we posted a 16% increase in local currency in Japan and an 18% gain in dollars. As we anniversary the impact of last year's earthquake, Japan is a mature market where we are focusing on the Men's opportunity and gaining share in the women's category.
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and newness, with the launch of the Hamptons Weekend collection introduced in April and update to Poppy and Madison throughout the quarter. Looking forward, we're excited about the distinctive new look you will see in our stores with the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection, which is being introduced over the next month globally. Inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring distinctive Coach elements, it is our largest product launch in many years. This iconic collection provides a new foundation for the brand, targeting multi-generational consumers who are both classic and stylish in their preferences. As we've discussed, the Legacy launch is driving new merchandising strategies including: first, presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves; second, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment; and thirdly, driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key item.
In support of the launch, we're rolling out new visual merchandising enhancements to about 100 of our leading stores in North America, as well as key international locations. This is providing a vibrant new backdrop for the collection, driving consumer interest. Legacy launched in North America just about 10 days ago. So with only a week's worth of sales results, we can tell you that we are pleased with the collection's performance. Thus far, the duffel and the canvas carryall are the top handbag styles as planned. The vibrant colors are being very well received in both handbags and women's accessories, and prints and fashion styles are best sellers. Of course, we plan to support Legacy through a greater investment in integrated marketing communications, featuring bold new creative across print, digital and outsource. These major marketing initiatives are timed to coincide with the publication of the September fashion books when they drop in mid-August. 
Naturally, I also want to update you on Men's, a key global initiative. As mentioned, Men's doubled again in FY '12 to over $400 million globally. And we're experiencing success across all concepts and store types including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. Outside of the U.S. where the male consumer tends to be more style-conscious, we've also opened a number of Men's dedicated stores as well as dual-gender stores. At the end of the year, an expanded assortment of Men's was available in about half of our directly-operated Coach locations globally as well as in many key distributor-operated locations. This performance underscores our confidence in Men's as a significant growth driver for Coach. We continue to believe it will continue -- it will contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we enter FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged; first, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and product -- productivity gains; second, continuing to build our women's business in the North American market; third, tapping into the large and now rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which I've already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
Starting with distribution, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '13, consistent with last year. Beginning in North America, we will open at least 30 new stores in FY '13, including about 10 new Full Price locations and at least 20 factory outlets, of which about 10 will be Men's stores. One of these new Full Price locations will be a concession shop-in-shop at Macy's Herald Square opening early this fall, the first of its kind for Coach in the U.S. We are very excited about this important department store location, which will feature a flagship face designed for us by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas who will also be designing our Omotesando flagship in Tokyo next spring. 
In addition, we're planning to expand about 20 locations, 5 Full Price and 15 factory, to create side-by-side stores with a separate entrance and dedicated Men's shop. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of at least 10% this year, similar to last year, driven by our expanding Men's business.
Turning to China. As you know, we're committed to open -- opening about 30 new locations a year. Finding the right people to manage and staff our stores to provide the right Coach in-store experience constrains us from more rapid distribution growth. In FY '13, we again expect to open about 30 new stores, bringing the total to around 125 locations at the end of the year. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35% in FY '13. And we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and comparable location sales.
In terms of our other direct markets of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, our primary focus is driving productivity as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments and systems, creating a brand-right experience. This will also be true of Korea, where we are acquiring the domestic retail business from our current distributor within the next few days. As a reminder, Coach's current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail or about 5% of the $2.6 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 48 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party duty-free operators and they're not part of this agreement.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains challenging and the category continues to be fairly stagnant, although fully back to pre-earthquake levels. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 10 net new locations in Japan, most of them dedicated Men's doors. We are also particularly excited about our 5,000 square foot Omotesando flagship, scheduled to open next spring. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12. 
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. Brazil, Kuwait and Vietnam were all new markets for Coach in FY '12. Finally, beyond our directly owned businesses in Asia, we're focusing on expanding through distributor partners in 3 regions: first, other emerging markets in Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia; second, Latin America including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; and third, the Middle East, where Kuwait has been our newest addition. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that continues to exist for Coach. 
Touching on Europe, we begun to build the foundation for long-term growth with 25 locations across the U.K., France, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. First in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. We had 5 locations opened at the end of FY '12 including 2 London flagships. We're continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. Second in France, where we are partners with Printemps, we've opened 9 locations to date. Importantly, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist as we build our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. Altogether, we expect to add about 5 locations in Europe during FY '13. 
I've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace, giving -- given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provide additional opportunities for growth. At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"

As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12% with direct-to-consumer, which represents about 89% of our business, up 13%; and our indirect segment
[Audio Gap] 
with prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 24% and totaled $251 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.86, up 27%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 15%, totaling $4.76 billion. We saw leverage to the bottom line with earnings per share at $3.53, up 21%, and net income of $1.04 billion, up 18%. For the quarter, operating income totaled $371 million on a non-GAAP basis, 19% above the $312 million reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.1% versus 30.3% for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit rose 13% to $838 million from 748 -- $741 million recorded a year ago while gross margin was 72.6% versus 71.8%, primarily due to channel mix and sourcing cost improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.5% compared to 41.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 100 basis points of leverage in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L. 
During the quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contributions, which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was $352 million with a 30.4% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 42.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, operating income totaled $1.55 billion, 17% above the $1.33 billion reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.6% versus 32.0%. For the year, gross profit rose 15% to -- $3.47 billion from $3.02 billion a year ago. As expected, gross margin was 72.8% versus 72.7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.2% compared to the 40.7% reported in fiscal 2011. 
During both FY '12 and FY '11, we recorded certain items including favorable tax settlements. As a result and in both years, we made charitable contributions, which precisely offset the benefit of these tax settlements to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fiscal year 2012 was $1.51 billion, with a 31.7% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.0%. This compared to fiscal year 2011 operating income of $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis with an operating margin of 31.4% and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.3%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $504 million, up 19.6% from FY '11 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support distribution growth and to maximize sales this summer and fall. Cash and short-term investments stood at $917 million, 31% above the $702 million a year ago, after $700 million of share repurchases in the interim 12 months. 
During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 2.5 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $67.79, spending a total of $169 million At the end of the year, 262 million remained under our present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $283 million compared to $221 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $210 million versus $164 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $73 million versus $57 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2012, net cash from operating activities was $1.2 billion, compared to $1 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '12 was an inflow of $1 billion versus $886 million in fiscal year '11. 
CapEx spending totaled $184 million for the year compared to $148 million in the prior year. It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '13, we expect that our CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansion across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Consistent with our practice over the past several years, we are not giving specific guidance for FY '13. We're mindful of balancing the impact of a muted consumer environment in North America and a softening global macroeconomic outlook, with our optimism around the launch of Legacy, Men's growth and the strong international expansion opportunities for Coach. As noted, FY '13 will be an investment year for us as we amplify our actions to drive long-term growth. Our most significant investment is accelerating our international growth through the acquisition of the domestic retail operation of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. 
In FY '13, we will also distort our investments in the digital space to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers. In addition, we will increase our marketing spend toward strengthening our brand positioning with distinctive new product and elevated store environment across all channels and geographies. Some of these initiatives will be in the form of CapEx, as I mentioned, while others will result in higher operating expenses, such as those associated with the transition of the Asia retail businesses including Taiwan, which we won't anniversary until January 2013; and the Malaysia and Korea, which will be acquired in Q1. So while our core businesses are expected to continue to deliver modest operating leverage, we expect that together, these investments, along the with increased brand support, will result in some deleverage in FY '13 while providing a platform for -- to accelerate our earnings growth in the years beyond.
Therefore, when you're thinking about the year, keep in mind the following: first, and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our sales will be driven in part by low to mid single-digit comps in North America where our comparisons will be more difficult in the first half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a headwind early in the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points. In addition, the in-store enhancements and marketing programs for Legacy will have a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we further refine our international tax strategy. 
Therefore, when you're modeling out the quarters, I would like you to remember that the first quarter will be the most challenging in terms of both top line as we're up against very strong North American comp and a larger currency benefit, in bottom line due to the disproportionate impact of the investments and brand spend.
In summary, FY '12 was an excellent year, demonstrating our ability to manage our business nimbly while advancing our key growth initiative. We're accelerating our distribution plan to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies and capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally. Most importantly, our goals are unchanged. We remain committed to achieving double-digit top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholder. I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

And we saw a change in factory tempo in terms of traffic levels in factory stores. We responded to it. We took action. We pushed a stronger value message into our stores. We revamped our signage and presentation programs in the stores to show a more pronounced level of newness and value, and we continue to do that as we enter into July. And the learning for us is that as we see a more promotional environment, as we are up against a heavier promotional cadence in factory stores, we have to be nimble. We have to use a variety of levers in terms of messaging and pricing, and we have to run the business for a balance of sales productivity and margin improvement.

So we do see what occurred in our fleet late in the quarter heavily driven by the macro environment. And as Mike said, we were up against very strong promotional activities last year. In terms of product, certainly, product is a factor. We actually introduced a strong platform in the second half of June. We sent deletes from our Full Price, Kristin, and that coupled with the reinstatement of coupons, reinvigorated factory performance. We believe that when we look at factory bricks-and-mortar, both on digital as the nominee channel, that we have huge opportunities to drive additional factory sales. That is basically buying discontinued or made-for-factory product at a discount. And the appetite, of course, among consumers to buy product at a discount is insatiable and growing."

We're partnering with Macy's to really create a global flagship for Coach that will attract tourists, both from the United States and abroad, to Macy's to see our spectacular shop."

As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We were a",2685,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We were also very pleased with profitability levels in both the quarter and year, as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. We continued to diversify our supply chain, expanding our manufacturing base globally. Importantly, we made significant progress on all of our growth initiatives.
Moving on to some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '12 was highlighted by increases of 15% in revenue, 17% in operating income and 21% in earnings per share. It was a year of several milestones. First, we continued to leverage the international opportunity for Coach, growing organically through distribution and productivity while accelerating the acquisition of key Asian domestic businesses to our direct control. In China, Coach sales exceeded $300 million, up 64%, ending the year with nearly 100 locations. Second, our Men's business doubled in FY '12 to over $400 million, as we continue to open dedicated stand-alone and dual-gender locations globally, while also rolling out a broader expression of men's to nearly 1/3 of our North American retail stores by year end. Third, we successfully expanded our digital initiative, driving double-digit online sales growth, while also exploring new ways to communicate with our consumer and grow our database. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 1/3, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. 
This annual performance was capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.16 billion, an increase of 12%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.86, up 27% from the $0.68 in the prior year. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 2% on a comparable basis from prior year, while North American total direct sales rose 7%. Fourth, China sales rose 60% as we continue to generate distribution growth and significant double-digit comps in China. And finally, sales in Japan rose 18% in dollars and 16% in constant currency, anniversarying the 2011 impact of the earthquake and tsunami. 
During the fourth quarter, we opened 4 net new North American retail stores while also opening 7 factory stores, including 5 dedicated Men's stores. At the end of FY '12, there were 354 Full Price and 169 factory stores in operation in North America. This was an increase of 9 Full Price stores, including 3 Men's retail stores, as well as 26 factory stores including 16 Men's stores from the end of FY '11. 
Total square footage grew 10% for the year. In addition, as forecasted in our third quarter conference call, we accelerated the rollout of a broader expression of Men to an additional 50 locations in Q4. Therefore, at year end in North America, there were 30 Men's stand-alone factory stores, 50 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops -- I'm sorry, 5 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops.
Moving to China. During the quarter, we added 11 net new locations, 9 net on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 96 Coach locations in China, including 79 locations on the Mainland and 36 cities. Additionally, there were 14 locations in Hong Kong and 3 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 30 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 58%. 
In Japan, 3 locations were added, 2 Men's retail locations and a factory store. At year end, there were 187 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 35 factory stores and 7 duty free locations. In total, a net of 11 locations were added in Japan during FY '12 and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 6%. 
Finally, I wanted to mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First in Singapore, we now operate 7 locations; 5 were acquired last July, and we've opened 2 additional stores during the fiscal year. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January and opened a new store this quarter. Shortly after the fiscal year ended, we acquired our domestic businesses in Malaysia which included 10 locations, generating annual sales of about $30 million at retail.
Indirect sales, which represent about 11% of Coach's sales annually, were even with prior year on a comparable basis, adjusting for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Sales were driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores declined as we continued to tightly manage inventory in this channel given retail sales trends. 
At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and same-location sales gains. While in U.S. department stores, sales decreased moderately on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. 
We estimate that the addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category grew at least 10% in FY '12. Coach continued to participate in the market growth, performing similarly in our own direct channels. As you know, we're also continuing to drive our Men's business in North America through new stand-alone and dual-gender or side-by-side stores and by dedicating more space for a broader Men's assortment in existing retail stores. In FY '12, Coach's sales of Men's bags and accessories doubled in North America, driving the overall Men's premium category, which grew about 25% to nearly $800 million.
Over the fourth quarter, the economic backdrop in the U.S. clearly softened as consumer confidence and sentiment declined. However, our research shows that our customers' intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. 
Our revenues in North America rose 5% with our directly operated businesses up 7%, driven by a 2% comp. As noted in our press release, an increasingly promotional environment in North America led to slower growth than expected in factory stores, which was entirely responsible for the change in the overall retail comp trend from last -- from the prior quarter. As a result, we responded by reinstating our prior practice of in-store couponing in a cross section of factory locations late in the period. It's important to note that we have significant pricing flexibility and a variety of marketing levers available to us in this channel, which allows us to balance productivity gains and margin improvement.
The primary driver of our overall retail comp gain was an increase in average transaction size. The trends in our Full Price stores and overall e-commerce channels were consistent with the prior quarter. Our factory store comp was impacted by the elimination of in-store couponing throughout most of the quarter and also by slowing traffic to factory malls. 
Outside of North America, we saw very strong growth in our international markets. We achieved our strongest top line growth in China, which remains our largest geographic opportunity, given both the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the fourth quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% year-over-year, consistent with the prior quarter and fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales growth. As I noted upfront, this took our full year sales to over $300 million, up over 60%. 
For the quarter, as mentioned, we posted a 16% increase in local currency in Japan and an 18% gain in dollars. As we anniversary the impact of last year's earthquake, Japan is a mature market where we are focusing on the Men's opportunity and gaining share in the women's category.
Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and newness, with the launch of the Hamptons Weekend collection introduced in April and update to Poppy and Madison throughout the quarter. Looking forward, we're excited about the distinctive new look you will see in our stores with the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection, which is being introduced over the next month globally. Inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring distinctive Coach elements, it is our largest product launch in many years. This iconic collection provides a new foundation for the brand, targeting multi-generational consumers who are both classic and stylish in their preferences. As we've discussed, the Legacy launch is driving new merchandising strategies including: first, presenting a bolder lifestyle story about our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves; second, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment; and thirdly, driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key items.
In support of the launch, we're rolling out new visual merchandising enhancements to about 100 of our leading stores in North America, as well as key international locations. This is providing a vibrant new backdrop for the collection, driving consumer interest. Legacy launched in North America just about 10 days ago. So with only a week's worth of sales results, we can tell you that we are pleased with the collection's performance. Thus far, the duffel and the canvas carryall are the top handbag styles, as planned. The vibrant colors are being very well received in both handbags and women's accessories, and prints and fashion styles are best sellers. Of course, we plan to support Legacy through a greater investment in integrated marketing communications, featuring bold new creative across print, digital and outdoor. These major marketing initiatives are timed to coincide with the publication of the September fashion books when they drop in mid-August. 
Naturally, I also want to update you on Men's, a key global initiative. As mentioned, Men's doubled again in FY '12 to over $400 million globally. And we're experiencing success across all concepts and store types including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. Outside of the U.S. where the male consumer tends to be more style-conscious, we've also opened a number of Men's dedicated stores as well as dual-gender stores. At the end of the year, an expanded assortment of Men's was available in about half of our directly-operated Coach locations globally as well as in many key distributor-operated locations. This performance underscores our confidence in Men's as a significant growth driver for Coach. We continue to believe it will continue -- it will contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. 
As we enter FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged; first, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and product -- productivity gains; second, continuing to build our women's business in the North American market; third, tapping into the large and now rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which I've already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. 
Starting with distribution, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '13, consistent with last year. Beginning in North America, we will open at least 30 new stores in FY '13, including about 10 new Full Price locations and at least 20 factory outlets, of which about 10 will be Men's stores. One of these new Full Price locations will be a concession shop-in-shop at Macy's Herald Square opening early this fall, the first of its kind for Coach in the U.S. We are very excited about this important department store location, which will feature a flagship face designed for us by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, who will also be designing our Omotesando flagship in Tokyo next spring. 
In addition, we're planning to expand about 20 locations, 5 Full Price and 15 factory, to create side-by-side stores with a separate entrance and dedicated Men's shop. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of at least 10% this year, similar to last year, driven by our expanding Men's business.
Turning to China. As you know, we're committed to open -- opening about 30 new locations a year. Finding the right people to manage and staff our stores to provide the right Coach in-store experience constrains us from more rapid distribution growth. In FY '13, we again expect to open about 30 new stores, bringing the total to around 125 locations at the end of the year. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35% in FY '13. And we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and comparable location sales.
In terms of our other direct markets of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, our primary focus is driving productivity as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments and systems, creating a brand-right experience. This will also be true of Korea, where we are acquiring the domestic retail business from our current distributor within the next few days. As a reminder, Coach's current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail or about 5% of the $2.6 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 48 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains challenging and the category continues to be fairly stagnant, although fully back to pre-earthquake levels. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 10 net new locations in Japan, most of them dedicated Men's stores. We are also particularly excited about our 5,000 square foot Omotesando flagship, scheduled to open next spring. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12. 
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. Brazil, Kuwait and Vietnam were all new markets for Coach in FY '12. Finally, beyond our directly owned businesses in Asia, we're focusing on expanding through distributor partners in 3 regions: first, other emerging markets in Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia; second, Latin America including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; and third, the Middle East, where Kuwait has been our newest addition. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunities that continues to exist for Coach. 
Touching on Europe, we’ve begun to build the foundation for long-term growth with 25 locations across the U.K., France, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. First in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. We had 5 locations opened at the end of FY '12 including 2 London flagships. We're continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. Second in France, where we are partnered with Printemps, we've opened 9 locations to date. Importantly, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists as we build our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. Altogether, we expect to add about 5 locations in Europe during FY '13. 
I've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace, giving -- given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provide additional opportunities for growth. 
At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"

As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12% with direct-to-consumer, which represents about 89% of our business, up 13%; and our indirect segment
[Audio Gap] 
with prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 24% and totaled $251 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.86, up 27%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 15%, totaling $4.76 billion. We saw leverage to the bottom line with earnings per share at $3.53, up 21%, and net income of $1.04 billion, up 18%. For the quarter, operating income totaled $371 million on a non-GAAP basis, 19% above the $312 million reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.1% versus 30.3% for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit rose 13% to $838 million from 748 -- $741 million recorded a year ago while gross margin was 72.6% versus 71.8%, primarily due to channel mix and sourcing cost improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.5% compared to 41.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 100 basis points of leverage in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L. 
During the quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was $352 million with a 30.4% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 42.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, operating income totaled $1.55 billion, 17% above the $1.33 billion reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.6% versus 32.0%. For the year, gross profit rose 15% to -- $3.47 billion from $3.02 billion a year ago. As expected, gross margin was 72.8% versus 72.7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.2% compared to the 40.7% reported in fiscal 2011. 
During both FY '12 and FY '11, we recorded certain items including favorable tax settlements. As a result and in both years, we made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of these tax settlements to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fiscal year 2012 was $1.51 billion, with a 31.7% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.0%. This compared to fiscal year 2011 operating income of $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis with an operating margin of 31.4% and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.3%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $504 million, up 19.6% from FY '11 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support distribution growth and to maximize sales this summer and fall. Cash and short-term investments stood at $917 million, 31% above the $702 million a year ago, after $700 million of share repurchases in the interim 12 months. 
During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 2.5 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $67.79, spending a total of $169 million. At the end of the year, 262 million remained under our present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $283 million compared to $221 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $210 million versus $164 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $73 million versus $57 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2012, net cash from operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '12 was an inflow of $1 billion versus $886 million in fiscal year '11. 
CapEx spending totaled $184 million for the year compared to $148 million in the prior year. It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '13, we expect that our CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansion across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Consistent with our practice over the past several years, we are not giving specific guidance for FY '13. We're mindful of balancing the impact of a muted consumer environment in North America and a softening global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around the launch of Legacy, Men's growth and the strong international expansion opportunities for Coach. As noted, FY '13 will be an investment year for us as we amplify our actions to drive long-term growth. Our most significant investment is accelerating our international growth through the acquisition of the domestic retail operation of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. 
In FY '13, we will also distort our investments in the digital space to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers. In addition, we will increase our marketing spend toward strengthening our brand positioning with distinctive new product and elevated store environment across all channels and geographies. Some of these initiatives will be in the form of CapEx, as I mentioned, while others will result in higher operating expenses, such as those associated with the transition of the Asia retail businesses including Taiwan, which we won't anniversary until January 2013; and the Malaysia and Korea, which will be acquired in Q1. So while our core businesses are expected to continue to deliver modest operating leverage, we expect that together, these investments, along the with increased brand support, will result in some deleverage in FY '13 while providing a platform for -- to accelerate our earnings growth in the years beyond.
Therefore, when you're thinking about the year, keep in mind the following: first and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our sales will be driven in part by low to mid single-digit comps in North America where our comparisons will be more difficult in the first half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a headwind early in the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points. In addition, the in-store enhancements and marketing programs for Legacy will have a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we further refine our international tax strategy. 
Therefore, when you're modeling out the quarters, I would like you to remember that the first quarter will be the most challenging in terms of both top line as we're up against very strong North American comp and a larger currency benefit, in bottom line due to the disproportionate impact of the investments and brand spend.
In summary, FY '12 was an excellent year, demonstrating our ability to manage our business nimbly while advancing our key growth initiative. We're accelerating our distribution plan to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies and capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally. Most importantly, our goals are unchanged. We remain committed to achieving double-digit top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholder. I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

remain steady. We did see a change in run rate in factory. And what we saw was the success of our pricing strategy in Q3 against a less promotional environment, with more robust traffic trends were successful. We were able to maintain higher rates of productivity and comps, and that changed late in the fourth quarter as we anniversaried a more promotional environment in factory. And we saw a change in factory tempo in terms of traffic levels in factory stores. We responded to it. We took action. We pushed a stronger value message into our stores. We revamped our signage and presentation programs in the stores to show a more pronounced level of newness and value, and we continue to do that as we enter into July. And the learning for us is that as we see a more promotional environment, as we are up against a heavier promotional cadence in factory stores, we have to be nimble. We have to use a variety of levers in terms of messaging and pricing, and we have to run the business for a balance of sales productivity and margin improvement. And that's the approach that we're taking going forward."

So we do see what occurred in our fleet late in the quarter heavily driven by the macro environment. And as Mike said, we were up against very strong promotional activities last year. In terms of product, certainly product is a factor. We actually introduced a strong platform in the second half of June. We sent deletes from our Full Price, Kristin, and that coupled with the reinstatement of coupons, reinvigorated factory performance. We believe that when we look at factory bricks-and-mortar, both on digital as the nominee channel, that we have huge opportunities to drive additional factory sales.

That launch was timed exactly to the day with -- when we launched in our retail stores. I think the first major flagship in a department store that's going to be run by the Coach direct team in Herald Square as part of the accessories hall that Macy's is doing in New York is a tremendous opportunity for us and one that we may find some opportunities for a longer term in terms of the operating model.

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As we noted in our press release, we were pleased with our results this quarter, highlighted by double-digit top line growth, with strong comparable store sales, most notably in North America and China. We continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives, enhancing our leadership position in the North American Women's bag and accessory category through fashion innovation, aggressively growing our International business, becoming a market leader in the Men's accessory category and harnessing the power of the digital world.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of our domestic distributors in Korea and Malaysia, and reflective of our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, our board has just authorized a new $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization. While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were, first, net sales totaled $1.16 billion versus $1.05 billion a year ago, an increase of 11%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.77, up 6% from the prior year; third, North American sales increased 8% to $784 million from $729 million last year, with direct sales up 11% on a 5.5% comparable store sales increase; and fourth, international sales increased 15% to $362 million from $314 million last year, driven in part by a nearly 40% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double-digit comps.
Looking first at global distribution. During the quarter, we opened 5 North American factory stores, including 3 Men's stores. At the end of the period, there were 354 full price and 174 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new locations, one in Hong Kong, and the remainder on the Mainland, bringing the total number  to 104 locations, including 86 on the Mainland in 38 cities. In the wake of our recent Asia distributor acquisitions and including Singapore and Taiwan, which we took over last year, we now directly operate 92 locations in Asia, not including Japan and China. They include: 7 in Singapore, 10 in Malaysia, 27 in Taiwan and 48 in Korea. And in Japan, one Men's factory store is opened. At quarter end, there were 188 total locations in Japan with 23 standalone full priced stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 36 factory stores and 7 distributor operated wholesale locations.
Moving on to sales of productivity and starting in North America, which to-date represents about 2/3 of Coach's sales. Our total revenues in North America rose 8% for the quarter, while our directly operated business is up 11% technology. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 5.5%, with our factory store comps benefiting from a return to more promotional in-store practices, and our full priced store comp similar to prior quarter trends. Of course, our Internet business, driven by significant traffic gains, continue to drive overall comp. In the department stores, sales trends POS was essentially even with prior year, while shipments into department stores declined as inventories were planned lower.
Overall, we estimate the addressable Women's North American handbag and accessory category rose about 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's sales rose 11%. It's worth noting that our Men's business was also a significant driver of our overall sales growth in Q1.
Moving on to the international sales, which represent about 1/3 of Coach's total sales today, they rose 15% in the first quarter. China sales rose nearly 40% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by these results, as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourists to our global sales in the extremely high purchase, repurchase intent among existing consumers. 
Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea, also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter. In part, these countries benefited from the retail step up from prior year except for Singapore, which was purchased at the beginning of last fiscal year. In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double-digit rate. In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency, while sales in dollars were even with prior year. Coach holds a #2 place within the Japanese imports accessories market, with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand with the Japanese consumer who has become increasingly value-oriented. 
Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business where we experienced strong shipment growth as retail sales gains were driven by distribution expansion. While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I did want to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for the first quarter, as well as our holiday sales initiative. Mike?"

During the first quarter, we featured a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driven by our Legacy launch. We were very pleased by the excellent response to the collection as Legacy proved to resonate with consumers across geographies and demographic. Inspired by our archives and featuring the carryall style, Legacy underscores our heritage as an authentic leather goods brand, distinctively Coach and differentiated in the marketplace. While Madison and Poppy remained important collections during the quarter, we continue to build our Legacy momentum over the next several months. Additional seasonal offerings such as cold weather and Outerwear are being introduced this quarter, along with new brights, novelty element such as awful lot and color block. Of course, we are supporting the collection with innovative marketing programs were just launch Grand Central take over here in New York, with 84 Coach images focused on the Northeast corridor of the station over 4-week period. We're also taking over buses and telephone kiosks in both New York and Chicago during fall and holiday.
Additionally, our recently updated Madison collection featured new silhouettes, including the J fact, and the new carryall, which will deliver an early December. New Poppy will arrive just in time for holiday and will feature our much loved iconic Willis bag in beautiful colors, color block and a range of great sizes and shapes. 
And of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts from tech accessories to and wristlets and a wide range of items under $100 as well. In addition, our holiday product will be supported by comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November, featuring a powerful gift a message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
And our PR team working in conjunction with several of today's leading style authorities has developed a series of digitally-based initiatives centered around their favorite picks for holidays. Additionally, each of these style icons will curate designated shops of their holiday selections on coach.com.
I'd like to provide an updated on our Men's growth strategy, which is a significant opportunity for Coach, both here and North America where we have a long history of Men's leather goods resource and globally, where the category is more developed. During the last quarter, we added a broader assortment of Men's to an additional 14 full priced stores in North America, taking us to over 100 stores with a significant Men's presence by the end of September. We're seeing excellent response to our product, both in these retail stores and in our dedicated factory stores. Coach is rapidly becoming a leading brand authority in Men's bags and accessories. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we are now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, which sharing the modern classic as static that is the hallmark of Coach.
Moving to our stores, as part of our brand building initiatives, there's an opportunity both on our full price and factory stores to continue to elevate our store environments and to present a broader expression of Coach to our consumers. During the first quarter, to support Legacy, we rolled out new visual merchandising elements to about 100 retail stores and several key U.S. department store doors as well. These stores outperformed during the quarter, and we will continue to push these enhancements to more stores over the fiscal year. 
We've also experienced excellent customer response to our new 625 North Michigan Avenue flagship store in Chicago, which represents a new evolution of our retail concept and our new dual gender side-by-side concept store in Pentagon City Center. And just last week, we opened our first North America department store concession shop at Macy's Herald Square here in New York City. Designed by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, this flagship space reflects our newest and most modern design elements, including video and digital content. That provides an elevated environment to showcase our product and enhance the Coach experience within the department store. On the factory side, our store elevation and its enhancement strategy was piloted in our Riverhead and Woodberry common stores with excellent results. We will roll this program out to about 25 of our highest volume stores by mid-November prior to our peak holiday selling season.
In summary, we will continue to drive our Women's business through fashion innovation, leverage the opportunity in Men's and evolve our store and digital concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer, wherever she chooses to shop. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Looking towards",579,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed that the number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the season and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. Looking towards the balance of FY '13, our overarching strategies remained largely unchanged. First, we're leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and productivity gains. Second, continuing to enhance our leadership position in the North America Women's bag accessory market, as we strengthen our position in lifestyle categories such as footwear. Third, we're tapping into the large and rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which Mike has already discussed. And fourth, we're harnessing the growing power of the digital world.
Starting with distribution. First, as our plans haven't changed materially from what we outlined on the July earnings call, I will be brief. To start, we expected that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% or 11% during this year. In North America, we now expect to add about 25 net new stores, including 20 factory stores, of which 10 will be Men's standalone location. 
Turning to international, and starting with China. We again expect to open about 30 new stores this year, bringing the total to around 125 locations by year's end. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%. And as we said earlier, we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and same location sales growth.
We were also very excited to announce a new distribution channel for China, e-commerce, which we expect to go live next month, providing Chinese consumers a new way to engage with the Coach brand. 
In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus this year is on driving productivity rather than new distribution as we continue to invest in people through training, as well as merchandising, store environment and systems, creating a brand-right experience. In Japan, where the overall consumer market remains challenging, we expect to open about 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated Men's doors. In total, we expect that net square footage growth will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12.
Finally, as you know, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. We're focusing on expanding 2 partners in 4 regions. First, in Europe, where we have begun to build the foundation for long-term growth. Second, Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru. Third other Asia Pacific market such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia. And fourth, the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant Global Travel Retail opportunities that continue to exist for Coach as the brand's recognition continues to grow globally. 
We've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace, given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in international -- both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provides additional opportunities for growth.
At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further details on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"
526573,222981508,367853,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2012",2012-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Next, Lew.

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter result. As a reminder, and as noted in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we've changed our segment reporting for FY '13 to a geographic focus, recognizing the expansion and growth of sales through our international market. This quarter, revenues increased 11%, with North America up 8% and international sales up 15%. Net income for the quarter totaled $221 million, up 3%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.77, up 6%. This compared to net income of $215 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.73 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $332 million, 3% above the $322 million reported last year, while operating margin was 28.6% versus 30.7%. This growth and our continued high level of profitability was achieved, while making unusual investments in our business, primarily related to our distributor acquisition, which we had previewed in our last conference call.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $845 million versus $765 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. The gross margin rate was 72.8%, even with prior year, with our sourcing cost improvement offsetting the higher cost of inventory repurchased in our acquisition. As expected, our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 44.2% compared to the 42.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of distributor acquisition cost, we were able to gain leverage to EPS. As you know, our most significant investments is accelerate our international grow through the acquisition of domestic retail -- of the domestic retail operations of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. We are also distorting our investment in the digital phase to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $598 million, 15% above the $520 million reported at the end of last year's Q1, consistent with our expectations given the repurchase of inventory from our newly acquired market. It will allow us to support distribution growth and to maximize this sale and holiday. 
Cash and short-term investments fitted [ph] $761 million, as compared with $848 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.59, spending a total of $175 million. With only $87 million remaining of the previous authorization, the board authorized another $1.5 billion in share repurchases.
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $202 million compared to $225 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $146 million versus $194 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending were $56 million versus $31 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, we expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environment within our existing store and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Looking at the balance sheet. The balance of 2013, the goals we articulated back in July have not changed. We remain mindful of balancing the impact of a weak global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around our business. So when you're thinking about the year, our plans are in line with those outlined in our July call. 
First, and most generally, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our FY '13 sales will be driven in part by low to mid-single-digit comps in North America for the year. As you know, our comparisons will be most challenging in second quarter given our extremely strong multi-year comp performance. However, we do expect the comps to strengthen in the second half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a top line growth headwind in the first half of the year. 
Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margins to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. 
Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points for the year. 
Fourth, therefore, taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leveraged EPS. 
And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter result, highlighted by double-digit top line growth and driven by strong comparable store sales in North America and China. Looking forward, we're accelerating our distribution plan to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally. Importantly, we remain committed to achieving double-digit growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in our brand, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. 
Now I'd like to open it up to Q&A."

And to the second part of your question, the performance of Legacy, as Mike touched on in his comments, Legacy is truly resonating globally, not just here in North America. And we're especially pleased with this performance in China where it is becoming a very strong second pillar for us alongside Madison. Madison has been since our launch in China with the take back of the business, a true iconic collection for us. It continues to be a very strong recruiting tool as such. And now Legacy is a second pillar and especially relevant with current Coach fans that are looking for a more subtle, more fashionable collection from a multicategory perspective. We're especially pleased in China with the performance of Men's and as well, even Outerwear where in certain locations we're seeing double-digit penetrations of Legacy Outerwear.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

We",840,"Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As we noted in our press release, we were pleased with our results this quarter highlighted by double-digit top line growth with strong comparable store sales most notably in North America and China. We continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives, enhancing our leadership position in the North American women's bag and accessory category through fashion innovation, aggressively growing our international business, becoming a market leader in the Men's accessories category and harnessing the power of the digital world.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of our domestic distributors in Korea and Malaysia, and reflective of our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, our board has just authorized a new $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $1.16 billion versus $1.05 billion a year ago, an increase of 11%; Second, earnings per share totaled $0.77, up 6% from the prior year; Third, North American sales increased 8% to $784 million from $729 million last year, with direct sales up 11% on a 5.5% comparable store sales increase; And fourth, international sales increased 15% to $362 million from $314 million last year, driven in part by a nearly 40% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double-digit comps.
Looking first at global distribution. During the quarter, we opened 5 North American factory stores, including 3 Men's stores. At the end of the period, there were 354 full price and 174 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new locations, 1 in Hong Kong and the remainder on the Mainland, bringing the total number  to 104 locations, including 86 on the Mainland in 38 cities. In the wake of our recent Asia distributor acquisitions and including Singapore and Taiwan, which we took over last year, we now directly operate 92 locations in Asia, not including Japan and China. They include: 7 in Singapore, 10 in Malaysia, 27 in Taiwan and 48 in Korea. And in Japan, one Men's factory store was opened. At quarter end, there were 188 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 36 factory stores and 7 distributor operated wholesale location.
Moving on to sales and productivity and starting in North America, which today represents about 2/3 of Coach's sales. Our total revenues in North America rose 8% for the quarter, with our directly operated businesses up 11%. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 5.5%, with our factory store comps benefiting from a return to more promotional in-store practices and our full price store comp similar to prior quarter trends. Of course, our Internet business, driven by significant traffic gains, continue to drive overall comp. In department stores, sales trends at POS was essentially even with prior year, while shipments into department stores declined as inventories were planned lower.
Overall, we estimate that addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category rose about 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's sales rose 11%. It's worth noting that our Men's business was also a significant driver of our overall sales growth in Q1.
Moving on to international sales, which represent about 1/3 of Coach total sales today. They rose 15% in the first quarter. China sales rose nearly 40% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by these results as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourists to our global sales in the extremely high purchase -- repurchase intent among existing consumers.
Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea, also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter. In part, these countries benefited from the retail step-up from prior year except for Singapore, which was purchased at the beginning of last fiscal year. In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double-digit rate. In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency, while sales in dollars were even with prior year. Coach holds a #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand with the Japanese consumer who has become increasingly value oriented.
Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business where we experienced strong shipment growth, as retail sales gains were driven by distribution expansion. While Jane will get into more detail in our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I did want to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for the first quarter as well as our holiday sales initiative. Mike?"

During the first quarter, we featured a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driven by our Legacy launch. We were very pleased by the excellent response to the collection, as Legacy proved to resonate with consumers across geographies and demographic. Inspired by our archives and featuring the duffle and Candace carryall style, Legacy underscores our heritage as an authentic leather goods brand, distinctively Coach and differentiated in the marketplace.
While Madison and Poppy remained important collections during the quarter, we continue to build our Legacy momentum over the next several months. Additional seasonal offerings such as cold weather and outerwear are being introduced this quarter, along with new brights, novelty elements such as Ocelot haircalf and colorblock. Of course, we're supporting the collection with innovative marketing programs like our just launched Grand Central takeover here in New York, with 84 Coach images focused on the northeast corridor of the station over a 4-week period. We're also taking over buses and telephone kiosks in both New York and Chicago during fall and holiday.
Additionally, our recently updated Madison collection featured new silhouettes, including the Juliette satchel and the new carryall, which we'll deliver in early December. New Poppy will arrive just in time for holiday and will feature our much-loved iconic Willis bag in beautiful colors, colorblock and a range of great sizes and shapes.
And of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts from tech accessories to and wristlets and wide range of items under $100 as well. In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November, featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
And our PR team working in conjunction with several of today's leading style authorities has developed a series of digitally-based initiatives centered around their favorite picks for holiday. Additionally, each of these style icons will curate a designated shop of their holiday selection on coach.com.
I'd like to provide an update on our Men's growth strategy, which is a significant opportunity for Coach, both here in North America where we have a long history of men's leather goods resource and globally, where the category is more developed. During the last quarter, we added a broader assortment of Men's to an additional 14 full price stores in North America, taking us to over 100 stores with a significant Men's presence by the end of September. We're seeing excellent response to our product both in these retail stores and in our dedicated factory stores. Coach is rapidly becoming a leading brand authority in Men's bags and accessories. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we are now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, but sharing the modern classic aesthetic that is the hallmark of Coach.
Moving to our stores. As part of our brand-building initiative, there's an opportunity both in our full price and factory stores to continue to elevate our store environment and to present a broader expression of Coach to our consumers. During the first quarter, to support Legacy, we rolled out new visual merchandising elements to about 100 retail stores and several key U.S. department store doors as well. These stores outperformed during the quarter, and we will continue to push these enhancements to more stores over the fiscal year.
We've also experienced excellent customer response to our new 625 North Michigan Avenue flagship store in Chicago, which represents a new evolution of our retail concept and our new dual-gender, side-by-side concept store in Pentagon City Centre. And just last week, we opened our first North America department store concession shop at Macy's Herald Square here in New York City. Designed by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, this flagship space reflects our newest and most modern design elements, including video and digital content that provides an elevated environment to showcase our products and enhance the Coach experience within a department store.
On the factory side, our store elevation and enhancement strategy was piloted in our Riverhead and Woodbury Common stores with excellent results. We will roll this program out to about 25 of our highest volume stores by mid-November prior to our peak holiday selling season.
In summary, we will continue to drive our women's business through fashion innovation, leverage the opportunity in Men's and evolve our store and digital concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer wherever she chooses to shop.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Mike just discussed the number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor for top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. Looking towards",578,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed the number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor for top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. Looking towards the balance of FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. First, we're leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and productivity gains. Second, we're continuing to enhance our leadership position in the North American women's bag accessory market, as we strengthen our position in lifestyle categories such as footwear. Third, we're tapping into the large and rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which Mike has already discussed. And fourth, we're harnessing the growing power of the digital world.
Starting with distribution. First, as our plans haven't changed materially from what we outlined on the July earnings call, I will be brief. To start, we expected that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% or 11% during this year. In North America, we now expect to add about 25 net new stores, including 20 factory stores, of which 10 will be Men's stand-alone location.
Turning to international and starting with China, we again expect to open about 30 new stores this year, bringing the total to around 125 locations by year's end. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%. And as we said earlier, we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and same location sales growth.
We're also very excited to announce a new distribution channel for China, e-commerce, which we expect to go live next month, providing Chinese consumers a new way to engage with the Coach brand. 
In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus this year is on driving productivity rather than new distribution, as we continue to invest in people through training, as well as merchandising, store environment and systems, creating a brand-right experience. In Japan, where the overall consumer market remains challenging, we expect to open about 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated Men's doors. In total, we expect that net square footage growth will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12.
Finally, as you know, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. We're focusing on expanding 2 partners in 4 regions: first, in Europe, where we have begun to build the foundation for long-term growth; second, Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; third other Asia-Pacific markets such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia; and fourth, the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunities that continue to exist for Coach, as the brand's recognition continues to grow globally.
We've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in international -- both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provides additional opportunities for growth.
At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter result. As a reminder, and as noted in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we've changed our segment reporting for FY '13 to a geographic focus, recognizing the expansion and growth of sales through our international market. This quarter, revenues increased 11%, with North America up 8% and international sales up 15%. Net income for the quarter totaled $221 million, up 3%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.77, up 6%. This compared to net income of $215 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.73 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $332 million, 3% above the $322 million reported last year, while operating margin was 28.6% versus 30.7%. This growth and our continued high level of profitability was achieved while making unusual investments in our business, primarily related to our distributor acquisitions, which we had previewed in our last conference call.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $845 million versus $765 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. The gross margin rate was 72.8%, even with prior year, with our sourcing cost improvement offsetting the higher cost of inventory repurchased in our acquisitions. As expected, our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 44.2% compared to the 42.8% (sic) [42.1%] reported in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding the impact of distributor acquisition costs, we were able to gain leverage to EPS. As you know, our most significant investment is accelerate in our international growth through the acquisition of domestic retail -- of the domestic retail operations of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. We are also distorting our investment in the digital phase to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $598 million, 15% above $520 million reported at the end of last year's Q1, consistent with our expectations given the repurchase of inventory from our newly acquired market. It will allow us to support distribution growth and to maximize this sale and holiday.
Cash and short-term investments pitted [ph] $761 million as compared with $848 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.59, spending a total of $175 million. With only $87 million remaining of the previous authorization, the board authorized another $1.5 billion in share repurchases.
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $202 million compared to $225 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $146 million versus $194 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending were $56 million versus $31 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, we expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing store and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Looking at the balance sheet. At the balance of 2013, the goals we articulated back in July have not changed. We remain mindful of balancing the impact of a weak global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around our business. So when you're thinking about the year, our plans are in line with those outlined in our July call.
First and most generally, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our FY '13 sales will be driven in part by low- to mid-single-digit comps in North America for the year. As you know, our comparisons will be most challenging in the second quarter given our extremely strong multi-year comp performance. However, we do expect comps to strengthen in the second half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a top line growth headwind in the first half of the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margins to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points for the year. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leveraged EPS. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter result, highlighted by double-digit top line growth and driven by strong comparable sales -- same -- comparable store sales in North America and China. Looking forward, we're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally.
Importantly, we remain committed to achieving double-digit growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
Now I'd like to open it up to Q&A. Operator, you may go ahead."

As Mike touched on in his comments, Legacy is truly resonating globally, not just here in North America. And we're especially pleased with its performance in China where it is becoming a very strong second pillar for us alongside Madison. Madison has been, since our launch in China with the takeback of the business, a true iconic collection for us and continues to be a very strong recruiting tool as such. And now Legacy is a second pillar and especially relevant with current Coach fans that are looking for a more subtle, more fashionable collection from a multi-category perspective. We're especially pleased in China with the performance of Men's and as well, even outerwear where in certain locations we're seeing double-digit penetrations of Legacy outerwear.

So what I think occurred out there, which was a pickup on your side a bit, was we did experiment with some customer acquisitions, third-party opportunities within the digital space. And that created some noise in the marketplace. We'll continue to probe on that and experiment, but it's really not a large segment of our business. On the factory side, as we stated in Q4, we were going to take a more promotional stance in our stores around in-store marketing. And that proved to be very successful. And I might add there that we're really pleased on the factory side, as we return to marketing tactics in-store.

Our flagship stores outperformed in the quarter, driven by, I think, a more comprehensive Legacy presentation, including Men's that really cut through. We'll continue to build on that.

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

We",839,"Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As we noted in our press release, we were pleased with our results this quarter highlighted by double-digit top line growth with strong comparable store sales most notably in North America and China. We continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives, enhancing our leadership position in the North American women's bag and accessory category through fashion innovation, aggressively growing our international business, becoming a market leader in the Men's accessories category and harnessing the power of the digital world.
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of our domestic distributors in Korea and Malaysia, and reflective of our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, our board has just authorized a new $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $1.16 billion versus $1.05 billion a year ago, an increase of 11%; Second, earnings per share totaled $0.77, up 6% from prior year; Third, North American sales increased 8% to $784 million from $729 million last year, with direct sales up 11% on a 5.5% comparable store sales increase; And fourth, international sales increased 15% to $362 million from $314 million last year, driven in part by a nearly 40% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double-digit comps.
Looking first at global distribution. During the quarter, we opened 5 North American factory stores, including 3 Men's stores. At the end of the period, there were 354 full price and 174 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new locations, 1 in Hong Kong and the remainder on the Mainland, bringing the total number to 104 locations, including 86 on the Mainland in 38 cities. In the wake of our recent Asia distributor acquisition and including Singapore and Taiwan, which we took over last year, we now directly operate 92 locations in Asia, not including Japan and China. They include: 7 in Singapore, 10 in Malaysia, 27 in Taiwan and 48 in Korea. And in Japan, one Men's factory store was opened. At quarter end, there were 188 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 36 factory stores and 7 distributor operated wholesale location.
Moving on to sales and productivity and starting in North America, which today represents about 2/3 of Coach's sales. Our total revenues in North America rose 8% for the quarter, with our directly operated businesses up 11%. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 5.5%, with our factory store comps benefiting from a return to more promotional in-store practices and our full price store comp similar to prior quarter trends. Of course, our Internet business, driven by significant traffic gains, continued to drive overall comp. In department stores, sales trends at POS was essentially even with prior year, while shipments into department stores declined as inventories were planned lower.
Overall, we estimate that addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category rose about 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's sales rose 11%. It's worth noting that our Men's business was also a significant driver of our overall sales growth in Q1.
Moving on to international sales, which represent about 1/3 of Coach total sales today. They rose 15% in the first quarter. China sales rose nearly 40% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by these results as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourists to our global sales in the extremely high purchase -- repurchase intent among existing consumers.
Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea, also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter. In part, these countries benefited from the retail step-up from prior year except for Singapore, which was purchased at the beginning of last fiscal year. In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double-digit rate. In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency, while sales in dollars were even with prior year. Coach holds a #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand with the Japanese consumer who has become increasingly value oriented.
Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business where we experienced strong shipment growth, as retail sales gains were driven by distribution expansion. While Jane will get into more detail in our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I did want to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for the first quarter as well as our holiday sales initiative. Mike?"

During the first quarter, we featured a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driven by our Legacy launch. We were very pleased by the excellent response to the collection, as Legacy proved to resonate with consumers across geographies and demographic. Inspired by our archives and featuring the duffle and Candace carryall style, Legacy underscores our heritage as an authentic leather goods brand, distinctively Coach and differentiated in the marketplace.
While Madison and Poppy remained important collections during the quarter, we continue to build our Legacy momentum over the next several months. Additional seasonal offerings such as cold weather and outerwear are being introduced this quarter, along with new brights, novelty elements such as Ocelot haircalf and colorblock. Of course, we're supporting the collection with innovative marketing programs like our just launched Grand Central takeover here in New York, with 84 Coach images focused on the northeast corridor of the station over a 4-week period. We're also taking over buses and telephone kiosks in both New York and Chicago during fall and holiday.
Additionally, our recently updated Madison collection featured new silhouettes, including the Juliette satchel and the new carryall, which we'll deliver in early December. New Poppy will arrive just in time for holiday and will feature our much-loved iconic Willis bag in beautiful colors, colorblock and a range of great sizes and shapes.
And of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts from tech accessories to wristlets and a wide range of items under $100 as well. In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November, featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
And our PR team working in conjunction with several of today's leading style authorities has developed a series of digitally-based initiatives centered around their favorite picks for holiday. Additionally, each of these style icons will curate a designated shop of their holiday selection on coach.com.
I'd like to provide an update on our Men's growth strategy, which is a significant opportunity for Coach, both here in North America where we have a long history as a men’s leather goods resource and globally, where the category is more developed. During the last quarter, we added a broader assortment of Men's to an additional 14 full price stores in North America, taking us to over 100 stores with a significant Men's presence by the end of September. We're seeing excellent response to our product both in these retail stores and in our dedicated factory stores. Coach is rapidly becoming a leading brand authority in Men's bags and accessories. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we are now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, but sharing the modern classic aesthetic that is the hallmark of Coach.
Moving to our stores. As part of our brand-building initiative, there's an opportunity both in our full price and factory stores to continue to elevate our store environment and to present a broader expression of Coach to our consumers. During the first quarter, to support Legacy, we rolled out new visual merchandising elements to about 100 retail stores and several key U.S. department store doors as well. These stores outperformed during the quarter, and we will continue to push these enhancements to more stores over the fiscal year.
We've also experienced excellent customer response to our new 625 North Michigan Avenue flagship store in Chicago, which represents a new evolution of our retail concept and our new dual-gender, side-by-side concept store in Pentagon City Centre. And just last week, we opened our first North America department store concession shop at Macy's Herald Square here in New York City. Designed by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, this flagship space reflects our newest and most modern design elements, including video and digital content that provides an elevated environment to showcase our products and enhance the Coach experience within a department store.
On the factory side, our store elevation and enhancement strategy was piloted in our Riverhead and Woodbury Common stores with excellent results. We will roll this program out to about 25 of our highest volume stores by mid-November prior to our peak holiday selling season.
In summary, we will continue to drive our women's business through fashion innovation, leverage the opportunity in Men's and evolve our store and digital concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer wherever she chooses to shop.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Mike just discussed a number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. Looking towards th",578,"Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. Looking towards the balance of FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. First, we're leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and productivity gains. Second, we're continuing to enhance our leadership position in the North American women's bag and accessory market, as we strengthen our position in lifestyle categories such as footwear. Third, we're tapping into the large and rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which Mike has already discussed. And fourth, we're harnessing the growing power of the digital world.
Starting with distribution. First, as our plans haven't changed materially from what we outlined on the July earnings call, I will be brief. To start, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% or 11% during this year. In North America, we now expect to add about 25 net new stores, including 20 factory stores, of which 10 will be Men's stand-alone location.
Turning to international and starting with China, we again expect to open about 30 new stores this year, bringing the total to around 125 locations by year's end. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%. And as we said earlier, we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and same location sales growth.
We're also very excited to announce a new distribution channel for China, e-commerce, which we expect to go live next month, providing Chinese consumers a new way to engage with the Coach brand. 
In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus this year is on driving productivity rather than new distribution, as we continue to invest in people through training, as well as merchandising, store environment and systems, creating a brand-right experience. In Japan, where the overall consumer market remains challenging, we expect to open about 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated Men's doors. In total, we expect that net square footage growth will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12.
Finally, as you know, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. We're focusing on expanding through partners in 4 regions: first, in Europe, where we have begun to build the foundation for long-term growth; second, Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; third other Asia-Pacific markets such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia; and fourth, the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunities that continue to exist for Coach, as the brand's recognition continues to grow globally.
We've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in international -- both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provides additional opportunities for growth.
At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?"
526573,222981508,368258,"Coach, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2012",2012-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter result. As a reminder, and as noted in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we've changed our segment reporting for FY '13 to a geographic focus, recognizing the expansion and growth of sales through our international market. This quarter, revenues increased 11%, with North America up 8% and international sales up 15%. Net income for the quarter totaled $221 million, up 3%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.77, up 6%. This compared to net income of $215 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.73 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $332 million, 3% above the $322 million reported last year, while operating margin was 28.6% versus 30.7%. This growth and our continued high level of profitability was achieved while making unusual investments in our business, primarily related to our distributor acquisitions, which we had previewed in our last conference call.
During this quarter, gross profit totaled $845 million versus $765 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. The gross margin rate was 72.8%, even with prior year, with our sourcing cost improvement offsetting the higher cost of inventory repurchased in our acquisitions. As expected, our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 44.2% compared to the 42.8% (sic) [42.1%] reported in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding the impact of distributor acquisition costs, we were able to gain leverage to EPS. As you know, our most significant investment is accelerate in our international growth through the acquisition of domestic retail -- of the domestic retail operations of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. We are also distorting our investment in the digital phase to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $598 million, 15% above $520 million reported at the end of last year's Q1, consistent with our expectations given the repurchase of inventory from our newly acquired market. It will allow us to support distribution growth and to maximize this sale and holiday.
Cash and short-term investments [indiscernible] $761 million as compared with $848 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.59, spending a total of $175 million. With only $87 million remaining of the previous authorization, the board authorized another $1.5 billion in share repurchases.
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $202 million compared to $225 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $146 million versus $194 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending were $56 million versus $31 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, we expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.
Looking at the balance sheet. At the balance of 2013, the goals we articulated back in July have not changed. We remain mindful of balancing the impact of a weak global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around our business. So when you're thinking about the year, our plans are in line with those outlined in our July call.
First and most generally, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our FY '13 sales will be driven in part by low- to mid-single-digit comps in North America for the year. As you know, our comparisons will be most challenging in the second quarter given our extremely strong multi-year comp performance. However, we do expect comps to strengthen in the second half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a top line growth headwind in the first half of the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points for the year. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage to EPS. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter result, highlighted by double-digit top line growth and driven by strong comparable sales -- same -- comparable store sales in North America and China. Looking forward, we're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally.
Importantly, we remain committed to achieving double-digit growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
Now I'd like to open it up to Q&A. Operator, you may go ahead."

As Mike touched on in his comments, Legacy is truly resonating globally, not just here in North America. And we're especially pleased with its performance in China where it is becoming a very strong second pillar for us alongside Madison. Madison has been, since our launch in China with the takeback of the business, a true iconic collection for us and continues to be a very strong recruiting tool as such. And now Legacy is a second pillar and especially relevant with current Coach fans that are looking for a more subtle, more fashionable collection from a multi-category perspective. We're especially pleased in China with the performance of Men's and as well, even outerwear where in certain locations we're seeing double-digit penetrations of Legacy outerwear.

And that created some noise in the marketplace. We'll continue to probe on that and experiment, but it's really not a large segment of our business. On the factory side, as we stated in Q4, we were going to take a more promotional stance in our stores around in-store marketing. And that proved to be very successful.

On the promotional side across full price and factory channel, very consistent with prior years. I think the only nuance out there is the method of delivery. What we put in the mail, what we put -- what we're doing digitally and how we might play with regard to third-party opportunities. But our plans today are very consistent with last year. In terms of mix on products, penetrations over $400 were essentially the same in Q1. I think you've heard me this morning speak about what I'm sensing as an opportunity for more elevated products, which I think may have an impact on that price tiering going forward. We did see some improvement in ADT overall, which we are very pleased with. And we think we're extremely well positioned from a gifting and pricing standpoint across all channels as we head into the holiday quarter."

We really are well into a 4-year plan that we articulated, I believe, the last -- about a year ago. And that shift has benefited us as we move more and more of our production into countries outside of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, other countries.

Obviously, as we look forward, there is a lot of uncertainty about what labor costs will be around Asia and around the manufacturing base.

It dropped. We've been successful, and we have a great raw material team that really spans Asia and Europe and not only addresses leather-based costs but also addresses hardware. So we've had a very aggressive posture of taking positions we need to, optimizing our raw materials costs, which is about 60% of our cost of goods when you look at our handbag and small leather goods. So our expertise and credibility there, including creating new sourcing basis in our new countries where we're doing manufacturing, which cuts our logistics expenses, has all kind of contributed to keeping those costs in check and keeping us in a good place.
