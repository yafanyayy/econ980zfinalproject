We recognize that the year was a difficult one for shareholders and work to listen feedback intensify our efforts to improve both the performance and positioning of the company. 
We have taken important steps with the business portfolio and individual product lines to sharpen our focus, exposures, maintain or expand risk buffers and support capital generation and redeployment. We made progress in several areas with more work to do and will maintain an intense execution focus in 2012. 
There are many aspects of markets that one does not control. Today, I would like to highlight 4 important levers that we do control and actively utilize to improve future operating performance. First, we continue to reposition the business portfolio to maximize value over the medium to long-term. We're pursuing a number of steps to better align businesses, enhance risk profiles and reallocate capital to support shareholder value. 
Second, we are managing the volume and mix of new business through pricing products actively, insurance strategically and managing expenses, all to maximize profitability, benefit statutory performance and improve our capital generation use and return profile. Third, we are managing the in-force portfolio through loss mitigation strategies, repricing actions, Life Insurance block transactions and active management of investment exposures. 
And fourth, we have taken actions to add to our enterprise holding company strength by expanding risk buffers and managing overall risk exposures and capital effectively. A key focus here is tied into our capital flexibility and distributable earnings profile to support dividends to the holding company, which benefits shareholders and bondholders. As you saw in our earnings release, we re-segmented our financials this quarter this reflects moves to align businesses to maximize operational and financial synergies. 
We are now operating through 3 divisions with 6 underlying reporting segments. There are clear benefits from our new structure. On the product and risk management front, we're getting better transfer of ideas, analytics and mortgage insurance loss mitigation strategies under this alignment. Financial synergy energy standpoint, we now have an approach in place that accelerates use of our tax assets and we have been able to improve the efficiency of capital structures. 
I'd like to provide some perspective on the 4 key leverage we control and how they impact each division. Starting with Insurance and Wealth Management, I'm pleased with the progress we are making to reposition the portfolio. We have exited nonstrategic lines such as variable annuities and Medicare Supplement. We better concentrate on our strongest market positions. We continued this in January, we announced sale of our tax and accounting advisors unit, Genworth Financial Investment Services or GFIS. 
This sale will allow us to focus on our core turnkey asset management businesses. We expect to receive $79 million in proceeds from this transaction and have an additional earn out opportunity. We are being selective regarding new business. We have implemented product design changes, repriced many products across life and long-term care insurance, as well as fixed annuities and have chosen not to follow certain competitive price changes. The long-term care insurance, we introduced our next-generation product with higher pricing to reflect today's lower interest rates while continuing to focus on preferred risk. 
In the international protection, we have focused on improving pricing and risk-sharing arrangements and change the business model to withstand higher unemployment. Revenue pressure from the low growth environment in Europe, we are entering or considering select new countries through reinsurance or small capital investments to rebalance our European concentration over time and support segment revenues. 
We are managing our in-force portfolio and long-term care through care management and are executing our second round of price actions where we have received approval in 39 states. And in Lifestyle Protection, margins have improved nicely over full year 2010 given pricing risk and cost actions. Finally, we remain focused on managing product mix, transactions and platforms outside the U.S. life companies to maximize statutory earnings and improve capital profile. 
We expect to continue shifting sales mix between life and long-term care versus attractively priced fixed annuities that are less capital intensive. And we are utilizing reinsurance actively in life and long-term care insurance to optimize new business capital needs. In addition, targeted transactions have improved and will continue to add to life company on the science surplus. This include the gains from unwinding and resetting forward interest rate swaps and the first life block transaction, which Marty will discuss in more detail. 
Finally, sound operating dividend generation by international protection and Wealth Management benefit the holding company. Turning to international mortgage insurance, we continue to move forward with our planned minority interest IPO of up to 40% of Australia mortgage insurance. We still anticipate second quarter 2012 execution. 
We have not encountered any regulatory or market conditions that would change that timing. Planned IPO supports objectives to rebalance the portfolio, maintain control of our strategic mortgage insurance platforms in our Australia and Canada add to risk buffers in conditions warrants and redeployed capital. Regarding new business, we have maintained pricing disciplines and guidance in a competitive environment. 
In Canada, we are working to gradually rebuild share as government guideline changes such as lower amortization product and lower LTVs and refinancings have contributed to a smaller market. Australia has seen a larger origination market and we renewed a number of key commercial relationships during the year while maintaining pricing discipline. In Europe, we reduced new business over time given the economic environment and stopped writing in some countries. 
We continue to manage that in-force portfolio to minimize losses through our loss mitigation activities such as workouts, settlements and asset management. On the capital front, international mortgage insurance achieved its dividend goals and remains a strong generator of capital as large order book season and smaller new books are written. We are also managing our capital risk through the establishment and use of global external reinsurance markets in certain countries. 
So as we look forward over the next few years, we expect capital generation to increase from these platforms. In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we saw improved financial performance over the past 2 quarters. But there is still a way to go here for recovery given the tough market. Our focus remains on risk containment of the in-force portfolio and claims paying ability. On this front, we remain active in the area of loss mitigation and continue to derive substantial results with the year-to-date benefits reaching $567 million. 
In assessing our in-force book, we place strong emphasis on internal and third-party analysis of our claims paying ability and we continue to see adequate claims paying ability and positive value in the business platform., which Kevin will discuss in greater detail on our February 10th call on USMI. We saw an increase in flow new insurance written over the prior year and prior quarter. Mortgage insurance penetration is up versus the FHA, especially in the purchase markets. 
We estimate that our market share is flat despite reallocations after exits by competitors as we have maintained our pricing and guideline discipline. And our post 2008 books of business are very profitable, significantly outperforming expectations. Regarding our ability to write new business, a complete evaluation must take into account several factors, including risk capital, claims paying ability, assessment of where books of business are in the loss curve and finally, capital alternatives. 
We invest appropriate time with regulators, customers and others to help support this comprehensive assessment approach. We have the following alternatives to support new business currently. First, we currently maintain regulatory waivers or other authorizations from 44 states that permit the company to continue writing new business while it's risk-to-capital ratio exceeds 25:21. Second, we have a subsidiary called Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation or GRMIC, which has capital supporting approximately 1-year of new business capacity nationwide depending on new volume levels. 
This entity can be used with GSE approval and currently 5 states are being written out of GRMIC. Third, we continue to work constructively with GSEs and regulators on creating additional flexibility to alternative structures that support future business, which could be funded internally, externally or through a combination of the 2. We also maintain the 4 demanding screens discussed on our prior calls, which would inform any future decision to provide additional capital support to the USMI business. 
As we outlined last quarter, given the alternatives in place and our adequate claims paying resources, we have no plans to contribute to capital to USMI. Finally, we have made ongoing progress in building buffers and managing overall capital and risk profiles at the holding company and operating businesses. At the holding company, we ended the year with approximately $950 million of cash or highly liquid securities, up $250 million from third quarter. The increase was driven by a series of actions taken throughout 2011. 
We have continued to actively manage our investment portfolio, reducing certain exposures particularly in financial, and believe our European portfolio is well-positioned. We've also managed our capital levels carefully at the operating platform level and have been very active over the past 10 years in executing forward interest rate hedges to protect against lower rate environments. We will go into further detail on the second call later this morning in how we are managing our exposures on the European asset and liability side, as well as how we are addressing the low interest rate environment. 
We've also streamlined costs across our platforms to enhance competitiveness, adjust to the realities of slower markets and match a more concentrated product and distribution focus. All of our strategies and steps across our 4 levers to improve business alignment and reposition the portfolio, be selective regarding new business, manage the in-force intensively, add the risk buffers at the holding company and pursue targeted capital strategies, support our goal of accelerating redeployment of capital and improving shareholder value. 
It's fair to say that 2011 was a challenging year from a market standpoint and a humbling year from my seat. Through the year, we intensified our focus and actions to improve Genworth. While we have made progress, we recognize that more work remains and so must our intensity, to enhance focus our business platforms today are deeper and stronger within their large target markets. We also have made a number of moves on the people front to strengthen the team our are capabilities. So our commitment remains one of the drive and execution, taking the steps we need to and building value. Now, let me turn it over to Marty. Marty?"
8598029,145606041,215402,"Genworth Financial Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2012",2012-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Genworth Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. I'll start with the Insurance",2077,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. 
I'll start with the Insurance and Wealth Management division where operating earnings increased 12% from the prior year to $145 million, driven by results in the U.S. Life Insurance segment. Operating earnings were down sequentially mainly from International Protection and results in the Life Insurance business. Insurance earnings were $60 million for the quarter. We continue to see sound new business performance impacting our results, as well as favorable mortality experienced versus pricing. 
Term UL and other universal life sales were down approximately 4% from the third quarter. We expect sales to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to our previous pricing actions and capital discipline. We continue to reduce reinsurance our new business to manage capital effectively and expect capital benefit of approximately $25 million per quarter in 2012. 
In addition, we are completing our first life block transaction, which will generate approximately $100 million in initial after-tax capital benefits for the life companies. We have executed the reinsurance treaty and are redeeming associated bonds under the terms of last month's successful bond tender. The transaction will be completed in the next few weeks. 
Long-term-care earnings were $38 million for the quarter. Reported loss ratio of 67% improved over the prior year and the prior quarter. We experienced low mainstreamer nation rates versus the prior year but we did see lower new claims compared to the third quarter, as well as an increase in active policy terminations, primarily in our older issued policies. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on a majority of the older issued policies has begun to take effect. 
We still expect the continued impacted in 2012 at about $50 million in initial premium in 2012 and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We are closely watching the performance of the older business and will assess potential additional rate actions accordingly. We continue to see sound performance across the block of new reissued policies, loss ratio of 50%, in line with prior quarter's. 
As we manage capital and risk the insurance new business, reinsuring about 40% of the new long-term care product. Fixed annuity earnings were $16 million as we adjusted for the state guarantee fund assessment. In December, we launched our new suite of index annuity products designed to further enhance our annuity product offerings. We expect to increase sales in 2012 by approximately 10% as we adjust the sales mix over products to build capital and statutory earnings in our life companies. International Protection reported earnings were flat to the prior year and decreased 24% sequentially due to top line pressure as European economic concerns reduced consumer and related insurance products sales. 
Despite the top line pressures, full year operating margins improved more than 360 basis points over 2010 results returning to 2008 pre-recession levels. Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter, all in 2011 full-year net flows were positive $1.4 billion despite a challenging environment and negative net flows in the fourth quarter. 
Last month we announced an agreement to sell Genworth Financial Investment Services or GFIS to Cetera Financial Group. GFIS accounted for about 14% of Wealth Management's earnings and about 11% of assets under management in 2011. Turning to capital, international Protection and Wealth Management paid $199 million of dividends to the holding company in 2011. We expect statutory capital for the U.S. life companies the unassigned surplus at year end is estimated to be in excess of $50 million. RBC ratio topped 400% as we completed the sale of our Medicare Supplement business during the quarter, and also realized tax benefits from locking in gains on our forward starting interest rate swaps. 
We still intend to dividend up to the holding company a significant portion of the proceeds from the Medicare Supplement sale over the course of this year subject to regulatory approval. As an important part of our strategy to reestablishes from our life companies by 2013, we're working on executing several initiatives to grow capital, statutory earnings and unassigned surplus in order to restore this capacity we will expand 2012 business goals call. 
Moving to the international MI segment, reported earnings were down by $20 million from the prior year and earnings decreased to 24% when excluding FX. Underlying performance for the quarter was mixed. Unemployment rose slightly in Canada and was flat for Australia while the housing markets are performing as expected. In Europe, the uncertain economic environment is creating pressure in some countries particularly Ireland. In Canada, excluding FX, operating earnings for the quarter were down 15% from the prior year. The loss ratio increased 4 points sequentially to 40% from our reserve strengthening associated with higher severity on existing delinquencies. 
In Australia, excluding FX, operating earnings were down 9% from last year. The loss ratio decreased 2 points sequentially to 46% reflecting a decline in new delinquencies. Delinquency rate improved across all regions sequentially. As part of our risk and capital management strategy, the Australian business continue to expand its reinsurance program. Combined, Canada and Australia paid dividends of $215 million to the holding company in 2011 and both platforms continue to generate capital as smaller books are written and larger books continue to season. 
The operating loss in other countries in the international mortgage segment was $15 million from losses driven by the European economic environment primarily in Ireland from higher delinquencies. Ireland is seeing increased new delinquency development from prolonged economic stress and significant home price declines. After several years of limiting new MI business in Ireland we stopped writing the business altogether midway through last year. 
In addition, we have been working to manage our exposure in Ireland through loss mitigation. We will expand in this subject as part of our discussion in the impacts of the European exposure for our company on our second call this morning. Turning to USMI, results continue to be impacted by weakness in the U.S. economy. Low NIW increased to 23% over the prior year and 19% sequentially reflecting the continued gradual shift away from the FHA and higher refinancing activity. 
Our estimated market share remains flat at about 40% as we maintain pricing discipline. Our total flow delinquencies decreased 1% sequentially with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn-through of 2005 to 2008 book years, as well as favorable impact from the geographic mix of new delinquencies in the quarter. Defaults on modifications continue to be within our ultimate expected range of 25% to 30%. 
Shifts in the payment status or aging was relatively stable while we did experience fewer net cures driven by declining loss mitigation consistent with our reserve strengthening in the second quarter. Our average flow reserve per delinquency is relatively flat at $29,100 and our total amount reserve for flow delinquencies by category is consistent with the third quarter. Loss mitigation savings in the quarter eased to $147 million with workouts declining 16% as HAMP modifications wind down. 
Our combined U.S. MI statutory risk to capital ratio increased to 28.8:1 in the quarter. GEMICO currently maintains weavers and other authorizations in 44 states and we are now writing business in 5 states out of Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation or GRMIC and to subsidiary of GEMICO. Five states account for about 10% of NIW. In the quarter, GRMIC's capital increased modestly to approximately $76 million and its risk to capital ratio is 1.6:1. We continue to believe that we have about 1-year of new business capacity across 50 states in GRMIC. 
Moving to the corporate and runoff division, improved variable annuity results driven by better market performance were offset by lower earnings from the sale of the Medicare Supplement business, as well as an after-tax goodwill impairment of $19 million related to reverse mortgage business. This business was acquired in 2007 and offers products that provide liquidity and retirement income to secure market consumers. 
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were down slightly at 4.6% in the quarter. Results reflect lower limited partnership income, as well as higher cash balances, which are being reinvested over the next few months. Impairments were down slightly in the quarter and from the prior year. We have $700 million or less than 1% of the portfolio in European periphery exposure, which was down $185 million from the third quarter primarily due to opportunistic sales. 
Turning next to the holding company we remain very focused on maintaining appropriate risk buffers. We also are making headway on our strategy to create further dividend streams to the holding company particularly in U.S. Life Insurance. These are important steps in maintaining our financial strength for policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $950 million, which is about $400 million over our cash buffer target of 2 times debt service coverage and we expect to maintain a similar exit in this uncertain economic environment. While we are moving forward with a minority interest IPO of the Australian Mortgage Insurance business our risk buffer plans are not dependent on this transaction. 
We continue to navigate the company towards a long-term leverage ratio in the 24% to 26% range, which is equivalent to our previously communicated range of 22% to 24% adjusted for the new DAC guidance. The holding company received $478 million in dividends in 2011. Let me now cover some accounting changes being made in 2012. We are adopting the FASB's new debt guidance and expect the impact will be reduction in retained earnings and stockholders equity of approximately $1.4 billion. 
We will defer fewer costs but record lower amortization. In describing the earnings impact going forward, there are 4 main drivers: sales growth, product duration, product mix, and distribution mix. Relative of our competitors, we believe that expected impacts are similar in our were life and annuity product lines but different in long-term care. For the last couple of years, sales of our long-term care products and generally growing faster than many others in the industry additionally, retail distribution channel is a relatively large percentage of our sales volume and is more negatively impacted from the lead generation expenses that are no longer deferrable. 
While not impacting economic or statutory results, in 2012 we expect negative impact on GAAP earnings from the new debt guidance of about $65 million to $75 million or about $0.13 to $0.15 per share with an impact of approximately $20 million to $25 million in Life Insurance and $25 million to $30 million in long-term care. We continue to evaluate a number of options for adjusting distribution and marketing structures to mitigate the effects of this new standard. Separately, we have change our accounting for reserves on our level, term Life Insurance products, which we no longer self. Under the prior approach, profits emerged as a level percentage of premiums and given the increasing premium streaming these products after the level of premium period reserves could become negative. 
While the amount of the negative reserves at year end was immaterial to the current balance sheet, over the years, the negative balances would've become much larger. While this approach is certainly compliant and consistent with industry practice at that time, more recent accounting models for long-duration contracts following approach, which emphasizes the balance sheet over the income statement. We believe accounting policy under these more is preferable flooring individual policy reserves at 0. 
We are making no changes to the assumptions which were locked in at the time these policies were issued. There will be a negative earnings impact of this new accounting policy of approximately $20 million to $30 million after-tax annually in 2012 and in the following several years. However, we believe this approach is more conservative in reduces balance sheet risk. asked with a new debt accounting guidance this policy affects only GAAP reported results not statutory or economic results. The impact from future lapses is higher than assumed will be significantly reduced. 
In closing, with the transitions made through 2011, we are very focused on improving performance of our businesses and generating capital while managing our risks in an uncertain environment. I'd now like to opening up for questions."

So I can't give you any assurance on a 2-year period, the second part of your question, I think that's a little long but I can tell you at this point in time we expect to be able to continue to write.

We saw that rebound in the fourth quarter in addition to the factors that Marty described, as well we'll go through on the next call that there are a number of impacts in terms of shifting our mix of business, greater use of reinsurance, on a full-year basis, I'd say the 2011 statutory earnings were below the level achieved in 2009 and 2010 primarily due to equity market and low interest-rate impacts but moderately higher long-term-care loss ratio but I would say though lead to the new year with the block transactions of the shifts that we've made in our new business capital allocation we're expecting to see that level client to at or above the historical levels and position us very well for our target of returning to ordinary dividend paying on an ongoing basis in 2013."

Now the loans are starting to make it through the delayed foreclosure process and starting to be perfective claims. And as we look at those claims and as we look at the way they were serviced, we're certainly looking at them very closely in terms of making sure that the servicers perform to the standards that are required in our master policy and where we see that there were some problems in that service think, or breakdowns in the way it was that in the marketplace and we all certainly read about that on a regular basis, we've been doing some curtailment of the claims trimming back on interest rate expense and other things we're frankly, there was no focus put on the consumer. So we have beefed that up a little bit and are going to continue to look at all claims, make sure we're paying every single legitimate one, make sure we're paying them consistently with our master policy. Now if you look at our supplement, just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, on the quarter, we probably paid 5,600 5,700 claims in total, something like that. And with an average improvement from the prior quarter as you referenced of about $6,000 per claim, you can get some handle on the impact that that might have over time."

Let me break it down on a few fronts. I'd like to start on statutory and move at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question and try to give you as thorough an answer as we can. First",556,"This is Mike. Let me break it down on a few fronts. I'd like to start on statutory and move at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question and try to give you as thorough an answer as we can. First on the statutory side as we laid out and we're going to lay out in quite a bit more detail on the second call today. In fact, providing you some exhibits that I think the investment community will find very helpful to see how we're thinking about statutory earnings, unassigned surplus and the path towards both improvements on both MSI and surplus in the stock front and how that results then in the common dividend, you'll see a roadmap, if you will, on that front. So we're very focused on that and that's really an underpinning because if you look at it we've had good dividend focus, good capital generation and subsequent dividend flows from the International Protection business. We have had from our Life Insurance business, Wealth Management and then reestablishing that on the U.S. life side, what comes off from the left margin division. And then again, out of Canada and Australia, we've seen good capital generation and dividend performance along with that. So those statutory and capital generation underpinnings are the foundation. When you get up to the holding company level and you think about the risk buffers we have, as Marty laid out, we're running about $400 million above our 2 times debt service coverage cushion we want to have. And then what do we do is we basically look at a stressed environment and say, what would happen if the bulk of your dividends didn't come up from your operating companies for say, 18 months because of some macro event out in the environment. And what type of buffer would you want to have to be able to handle that. And that would equate to about, when we talk about that risk buffer about $300 million, so that's a way to think about that and hence, Marty's commentary. As you move over that, because you still have the dividend that Marty talked about, we still have the closing of the GFIS sale coming, we have the majority IPO of Australia that's moving down the track right in accordance with their plans and you look at therefore, additional amounts, you'd say, how would you think about those proceeds. We should look at the environment, see if some things change from the risk environment that change your perspective on that risk of buffer I just laid out. Second, there would be what I'd say would be a proportional deleveraging and if you do a proportional deleveraging for a piece of business you sell then you're protecting your coverage ratios and then you're protecting your leverage ratios within that 24 to 26 range that Marty talked about and then you move to redeployment. So it's quite rigorous, statutory looking at dividend, going to the holding company, making sure that we have the risk buffers, targeting redeployment because we see shareholder value creation in that redeployment but maintaining the appropriate coverage and debt ratios along the way. So sorry for the long explanation but hopefully that's very helpful in seeing how we'd walk on that path."

In the second call, we will focus on 2012 in specifically addressing low interest rates, European exposure, the statutory earnings profile of the life companies and key business goals for 2012. Also as a reminder, we will be holding a webcast on Friday, February 10 from 10:00 a.m. till noon on our U.S. Mortgage Insurance business.

We recognize that the year was a difficult one for shareholders and work to",1783,"Thanks, Georgette. 2011 was a year of actions designed to reposition the company to move through an uncertain environment and provide a foundation for improved shareholder value. We recognize that the year was a difficult one for shareholders and work to listen, gain feedback, intensify our efforts to improve both the performance and positioning of the company. 
We have taken important steps with the business portfolio and individual product lines to sharpen our focus, rebalance exposures, maintain or expand risk buffers and support capital generation and redeployment. We made progress in several areas with more work to do and will maintain an intense execution focus in 2012. 
There are many aspects of markets that one does not control. Today, I would like to highlight 4 important levers that we do control and actively utilize to improve future operating performance. 
First, we continue to reposition the business portfolio to maximize value over the medium to long term. We're pursuing a number of steps to better align businesses, enhance risk profiles and reallocate capital to support shareholder value. 
Second, we are managing the volume and mix of new business, repricing products actively, utilizing reinsurance strategically and managing expenses, all to maximize profitability, benefit statutory performance and improve our capital generation use and return profile. 
Third, we are managing the in-force portfolio through loss mitigation strategies, repricing actions, life insurance block transactions and active management of investment exposures. 
And fourth, we are taking actions to add to our enterprise and holding company strength by expanding risk buffers and managing overall risk exposures and capital effectively. A key focus here is adding to our capital flexibility and distributable earnings profile to support dividends to the holding company, which benefits shareholders and bondholders. As you saw in our earnings release, we resegmented our financials this quarter. This reflects moves to align businesses to maximize operational and financial synergies. 
We are now operating through 3 divisions with 6 underlying reporting segments. There are clear benefits from our new structure. On the product and risk management front, we're getting better transfer of ideas, analytics and mortgage insurance loss mitigation strategies under this alignment. From a financial synergy standpoint, we now have an approach in place that accelerates use of our tax assets. And we have been able to improve the efficiency of capital structures. 
I'd like to provide some perspective on some of the 4 key leverage we control and how they impact each division. Starting with Insurance and Wealth Management, I'm pleased with the progress we are making to reposition the portfolio. We have exited non-strategic lines such as variable annuities and Medicare supplement to better concentrate on our strongest market positions. We continued this in January with the announced sale of our tax and accounting advisors unit, Genworth Financial Investment Services or GFIS. 
This sale will allow us to focus on our core turnkey asset management businesses. We expect to receive $79 million in proceeds from this transaction and have an additional earnout opportunity. We are being selective regarding new business. We have implemented product design changes and repriced many products across life and long-term care insurance, as well as fixed annuities and have chosen not to follow certain competitive price changes. 
In long-term care insurance, we introduced our next-generation product with higher pricing to reflect today's lower interest rates while continuing to focus on preferred risks. 
In the International Protection, we are focused on improving pricing and risk-sharing arrangements and change the business model to withstand higher unemployment. Given revenue pressure from the low growth environment in Europe, we are entering or considering select new countries through reinsurance or small capital investments to rebalance our European concentration over time and support segment revenues. 
We are managing our in-force portfolio and long-term care through care management and are executing our second round of price actions where we have received approval in 39 states. 
And in Lifestyle Protection, margins have improved nicely over full year 2010, given pricing risk and cost actions. 
Finally, we remain focused on managing product mix, transactions and platforms outside the U.S. life companies to maximize statutory earnings and improve capital profile. 
We expect to continue shifting sales mix between life and long-term care versus attractively-priced fixed annuities that are less capital intensive. We are utilizing reinsurance actively in life and long-term care insurance to optimize new business capital needs. In addition, targeted transactions have improved and will continue to add to life company on the science surplus. This include the gains from unwinding and resetting forward-starting interest rate swaps and the first life block transaction, which Marty will discuss in more detail. 
Finally, sound operating dividend generation by international protection and wealth management benefit the holding company. 
Turning to International Mortgage Insurance. We continue to move forward with our planned minority interest IPO of up to 40% of Australia mortgage insurance. We still anticipate second quarter 2012 execution. 
We have not encountered any regulatory or market conditions that would change that timing. The planned IPO supports objectives to rebalance the portfolio, maintain control of our strategic mortgage insurance platforms in Australia and Canada, add to risk buffers if conditions warrant and redeploy capital. 
Regarding new business, we have maintained pricing discipline and guidelines in a competitive environment. 
In Canada, we are working to gradually rebuild share as government guideline changes, such as lower amortization product and lower LTVs and refinancings have contributed to a smaller market. Australia has seen a larger origination market, and we renewed a number of key commercial relationships during the year while maintaining pricing discipline. 
In Europe, we reduced new business over time, given the economic environment and stopped writing in some countries. 
We continue to manage the in-force portfolio to minimize losses through our loss mitigation activities such as workouts, settlements and asset management. 
On the capital front, International Mortgage Insurance achieved its dividend goals and remains a strong generator of capital as large order book season and smaller new books are written. We are also managing our capital and risk through the establishment and use of global external reinsurance markets in certain countries. So as we look forward over the next few years, we expect capital generation to increase from these platforms. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we saw improved financial performance over the past 2 quarters. But there is still a way to go here for recovery given the tough market. Our focus remains on risk containment of the in-force portfolio and claims-paying ability. On this front, we remain active in the area of loss mitigation and continue to derive substantial results with the year-to-date benefits reaching $567 million. 
In assessing our in-force book, we place a strong emphasis on internal and third-party analysis of our claims-paying ability. And we continue to see adequate claims-paying ability and positive value in the business platform, which Kevin will discuss in greater detail on our February 10 call on USMI. We saw an increase in flow new insurance written over the prior year and prior quarter. Mortgage Insurance penetration is up versus the FHA, especially in the purchase market. 
We estimate that our market share is flat despite reallocations after exits by competitors as we have maintained our pricing and guideline discipline. And our post-2008 books of business are very profitable, significantly outperforming expectations. 
Regarding our ability to write new business, a complete evaluation must take into account several factors, including risk to capital, claims-paying ability, assessment of where books of business are in the loss curve and finally, capital alternatives. 
We invest appropriate time with regulators, customers and others to help support this comprehensive assessment approach. We have the following alternatives to support new business currently. First, we currently maintain regulatory waivers or other authorizations from 44 states that permit the company to continue writing new business while its risk-to-capital ratio exceeds 25:1. 
Second, we have a subsidiary called Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, which has capital supporting approximately one year of new business capacity nationwide depending on new volume levels. This entity can be used with GSE approval. And currently, 5 states are being written out of GRMAC. 
Third, we continue to work constructively with GSEs and regulators on creating additional flexibility to alternative structures that support future business, which could be funded internally, externally or through a combination of the 2. We also maintain the 4 demanding screens discussed on our prior calls, which would inform any future decision to provide additional capital support to the USMI business. 
As we outlined last quarter, given the alternatives in place and our adequate claims-paying resources, we have no plans to contribute to capital to USMI. 
Finally, we have made ongoing progress in building buffers and managing overall capital and risk profiles at the holding company and operating businesses. At the holding company, we ended the year with approximately $950 million of cash or highly liquid securities, up $250 million from third quarter. The increase was driven by a series of actions taken throughout 2011. 
We have continued to actively manage our investment portfolio, reducing certain exposures particularly in financials and believe our European portfolio is well positioned. We've also managed our capital levels carefully at the operating platform level and been very active over the past 10 years in executing forward interest rate hedges to protect against low rate environments. We will go into further detail on the second call later this morning in how we are managing our exposures on the European asset and liability side, as well as how we are addressing the low interest rate environment. 
We have also streamlined costs across our platforms to enhance competitiveness, adjust to the realities of slower markets and match a more concentrated product and distribution focus. All of our strategies and steps across our 4 levers to improve business alignment and reposition the portfolio, be selective regarding new business, manage the in-force intensively, add the risk buffers at the holding company and pursue targeted capital strategies, support our goal of accelerating redeployment of capital and improving shareholder value. 
It's fair to say that 2011 was a challenging year from a market standpoint and a humbling year from my seat. Through the year, we intensified our focus and actions to improve Genworth. While we have made progress, we recognize that more work remains and so must our intensity. Through enhanced focus, our business platforms today are deeper and stronger within their large target markets. We also have made a number of moves on the people front to strengthen the team and our capabilities. So our commitment remains one of driving execution, taking the steps we need to and building value. 
Now let me turn it over to Marty. Marty?"

I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. I'll start with the Insurance",2109,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. 
I'll start with the Insurance and Wealth Management division where operating earnings increased 12% from the prior year to $145 million, driven by results in the U.S. Life Insurance segment. Operating earnings were down sequentially, mainly from International Protection and results in the Life Insurance business. Insurance earnings were $60 million for the quarter. We continue to see sound new business performance impacting our results as well as favorable mortality experienced versus pricing. 
Term UL and other universal life sales were down approximately 4% from the third quarter. We expect sales to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to our previous pricing actions and capital discipline. We continued to use reinsurance on new business to manage capital effectively and expect a capital benefit of approximately $25 million per quarter in 2012. 
In addition, we are completing our first life block transaction, which will generate approximately $100 million in initial aftertax capital benefits for the life companies. We have executed the reinsurance treaty and are redeeming associated bonds under the terms of last month's successful bond tender. The transaction will be completed in the next few weeks. 
Long-term care earnings were $38 million for the quarter. The reported loss ratio of 67% improved over the prior year and the prior quarter. We experienced low claim termination rates versus the prior year, but we did see lower new claims compared to the third quarter as well as an increase in active policy terminations, primarily in our older issued policies. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on a majority of the older issued policies has begun to take effect. 
We still expect the continued impact in 2012 at about $50 million in additional premium in 2012, and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We are closely watching the performance of the older business and will assess potential additional rate actions accordingly. We continue to see sound performance across the block of newer issued policies, with a loss ratio of 50% in line with prior quarters. 
As we manage capital and risk, we use reinsurance on new business, reinsuring about 40% of the new long-term care product. Fixed annuity earnings were $16 million as we adjusted for the state guarantee fund assessment. 
In December, we launched our new suite of index annuity products designed to further enhance our annuity product offerings. We expect to increase sales in 2012 by approximately 10% as we adjust the sales mix over products to build capital and statutory earnings in our life companies. 
International Protection reported earnings were flat to the prior year and decreased 24% sequentially due to top line pressure, as European economic concerns reduced consumer and related insurance product sales. 
Despite the top line pressures, full year operating margins improved more than 360 basis points over 2010 results returning to 2008 pre-recession levels. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter. All in, 2011 full year net flows were positive $1.4 billion despite a challenging environment and the negative net flows in the fourth quarter. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell Genworth Financial Investment Services, or GFIS, to Cetera Financial Group. GFIS accounted for about 14% of wealth management's earnings and about 11% of assets under management in 2011. 
Turning to capital. International Protection and Wealth Management paid $199 million in dividends to the holding company in 2011. With respect to statutory capital for the U.S. life companies, the unassigned surplus at year end is estimated to be in excess of $50 million. 
The RBC ratio topped 400% as we completed the sale of our Medicare supplement business during the quarter, and also realized tax benefits from locking in gains on our forward-starting interest rate swaps. 
We still intend to dividend up to the holding company a significant portion of the proceeds from the Medicare supplement sale over the course of this year subject to regulatory approval. As an important part of our strategy to reestablish ordinary dividend capacity from our life companies by 2013, we are working on executing several initiatives to grow capital, statutory earnings and unassigned surplus in order to restore this capacity. And we will expand on these in our 2012 business goals call. 
Moving to the International MI segment. Reported earnings were down by $20 million from the prior year, and earnings decreased to 24% when excluding FX. Underlying performance for the quarter was mixed. Unemployment rose slightly in Canada and was flat for Australia, while the housing markets were performing as expected. 
In Europe, the uncertain economic environment is creating pressure in some countries, particularly Ireland. 
In Canada, excluding FX, operating earnings for the quarter were down 15% from the prior year. The loss ratio increased 4 points sequentially to 40% from a reserve strengthening associated with higher severity on existing delinquencies. 
In Australia, excluding FX, operating earnings were down 9% from last year. The loss ratio decreased 2 points sequentially to 46%, reflecting a decline in new delinquencies. The delinquency rate improved across all regions sequentially. As part of our risk and capital management strategy, the Australian business continued to expand its reinsurance program. Combined, Canada and Australia paid dividends of $215 million to the holding company in 2011. And both platforms continue to generate capital as smaller books are written and the larger books continue to season. 
The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $15 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland from higher delinquencies. Ireland is seeing increased new delinquency development from prolonged economic stress and significant home price declines. After several years of limiting new MI business in Ireland, we stopped writing the business altogether midway through last year. 
In addition, we have been working to manage our exposure in Ireland through loss mitigation. We will expand on this subject as part of our discussion of the impacts of European exposure for our company on our second call this morning. 
Turning to USMI. Results continue to be impacted by weakness in the U.S. economy. Flow NIW increased to 23% over the prior year and 19% sequentially reflecting the continued gradual shift away from the FHA and higher refinancing activity. 
Our estimated market share remains flat at about 40% as we maintain pricing discipline. Our total flow delinquencies decreased 1% sequentially with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn through of the 2005 to 2008 book years, as well as the favorable impact from the geographic mix of new delinquencies in the quarter. Redefaults on modifications continued to be within our ultimate expected range of 25% to 30%. 
Shifts in the payment status or aging was relatively stable, while we did experience fewer net cures driven by declining loss mitigation consistent with our reserve strengthening in the second quarter. Our average flow reserve per delinquency is relatively flat at $29,100. And our total amount reserve for flow delinquencies by category is consistent with the third quarter. 
Loss mitigation savings in the quarter eased to $147 million with workouts declining 16% as HAMP modifications wind down. 
Our combined U.S. MI statutory risk-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8:1 in the quarter. GEMICO currently maintains waivers and other authorizations in 44 states. And we are now writing business in 5 states out of Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, a subsidiary of GEMICO. Those 5 states account for about 10% of NIW. 
In the quarter, GRMAC's capital increased modestly to approximately $76 million, and its risk-to-capital ratio is 1.6:1. We continue to believe that we have about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states in GRMAC. 
Moving to the corporate and runoff division. Improved variable annuity results, driven by better market performance, were offset by lower earnings from the sale of the Medicare supplement business as well as an aftertax goodwill impairment of $19 million related to the reverse mortgage business. This business was acquired in 2007 and offers products that provide liquidity and retirement income to secure market consumers. 
Shifting to investments. The global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were down slightly at 4.6% in the quarter. Results reflect lower limited partnership income as well as higher cash balances, which are being reinvested over the next few months. Impairments were down slightly in the quarter and from the prior year. We have $700 million or less than 1% of the portfolio in European periphery exposure, which is down $185 million from the third quarter primarily due to opportunistic sales. 
Turning next to the holding company. We remain very focused on maintaining appropriate risk buffers. We also are making headway on our strategy to create further dividend streams to the holding company, particularly in U.S. Life Insurance. These are important steps in maintaining our financial strength for policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $950 million, which is about $400 million over our cash buffer target of 2x debt service coverage, and we expect to maintain a similar exit in this uncertain economic environment. While we are moving forward with the minority interest IPO of the Australian Mortgage Insurance business, our risk buffer plans are not dependent on this transaction. 
We continue to navigate the company towards a long-term leverage ratio in the 24% to 26% range, which is equivalent to our previously communicated range of 22% to 24% adjusted for the new DAC guidance. The holding company received $478 million in dividends in 2011. 
Let me now cover some accounting changes being made in 2012. We are adopting the FASB's new debt guidance and expect the impact will be a reduction in retained earnings and stockholders equity of approximately $1.4 billion. 
We will defer fewer costs but record lower amortization. In describing the earnings impact going forward, there are 4 main drivers: sales growth, product duration, product mix and distribution mix. 
Relative to our competitors, we believe the expected impacts are similar in our life and annuity product lines but different in long-term care. Over the last couple of years, sales of our long-term care products have generally grown faster than many others in the industry. Additionally, the retail distribution channel is a relatively large percentage of our sales volume and is more negatively impacted from lead generation expenses that are no longer deferrable. 
While not impacting economic or statutory results, in 2012, we expect a negative impact on GAAP earnings from the new debt guidance of about $65 million to $75 million or about $0.13 to $0.15 per share, with an impact of approximately $20 million to $25 million in Life Insurance and $25 million to $30 million in long-term care. We continue to evaluate a number of options for adjusting distribution and marketing structures to mitigate the effects of this new standard. 
Separately, we have changed our accounting for reserves on our level term life insurance products, which we no longer sell. Under the prior approach, profits emerged as a level percentage of premiums. And given the increasing premium streaming these products after the level of premium period, positive reserves could become negative. 
While the amount of the negative reserves at year end was immaterial to the current balance sheet, over the years, the negative balances would have become much larger. While this approach is certainly compliant and consistent with industry practice at that time, more recent accounting models for long-duration contracts following approach, which emphasizes the balance sheet over the income statement, we believe the accounting policy under these more recent models is preferable, and so we will be flooring individual policy reserves at 0. 
We are making no changes to the assumptions, which were locked in at the time these policies were issued. There will be a negative earnings impact of this new accounting policy of approximately $20 million to $30 million aftertax annually in 2012 and in the following several years. However, we believe this approach is more conservative and reduces balance sheet risk. 
As with the new DAC accounting guidance, this policy affects only GAAP reported results, not statutory or economic results. The impact from future lapses, if higher than assumed, will be significantly reduced. 
In closing, with the transitions made through 2011, we are very focused on improving performance of our businesses and generating capital while managing our risks in an uncertain environment. I'd now like to open it up for questions."

We think the actions we've taken over last year and the contributions we've made in the last 12 months of the capital levels provide us with a nice quarter to navigate through. We have shared all of our forecasts and our expectation on risk-to-capital development with both our regulators and with the GSEs. And at this point in time, we think they're considering things beyond just risk-to-capital when they assess our ability to continue to write. So they look at our strength of our reserves. They look at the quality of our portfolio. They look at the profitability of the new business, which adds to our claims paying. They look at where we stand on the loss curve and other capital alternatives. So I can't give you any assurance on a 2-year period. The second part of your question, I think that's a little long. But I can tell you at this point in time, we expect to be able to continue to write. We got the benefit of GERMAC, our wholly-owned subsidiary below GEMICO, in the event that GEMICO runs into some problem on the waivers.

Those proceeds were about $214 million in capital and that transaction closed early in October, so RBC is benefiting from that. And it's also benefiting from some deferred tax asset benefits around some of the forward-starting swap gains. So those 2 things together contributed largely to the increase. 
But really paying a regular dividend doesn't relate so much to RBC ratio as it does to the level of unassigned surplus, as well as to the statutory earnings that the companies have. We will talk more about this on our second call, but let me turn it over to Pat just to give you a little bit of sense for the development of unassigned surplus over the year and some other considerations."

We'll go through on the next call that there are a number of impacts in terms of shifting our mix of business, greater use of reinsurance. On a full year basis, I'd say the 2011 statutory earnings were below the level achieved in 2009 and 2010, primarily due to the equity market and low interest rate impacts, but -- and a moderately higher long-term-care loss ratio. But I would say that moving into the new year with the block transactions with the shifts that we've made in our new business capital allocation, we're expecting to see that level climb to at or above the historical levels, and position us very well for our target of returning to ordinary dividend paying on an ongoing basis in 2013."

First, what I wanted to convey regarding mortgage insurance is that we have seen benefit in having multiple platforms because of the diversification of risk that provides, certainly, we move know-how around the world.

So that's what I wanted to convey. We will, as I think we have over time, always reassess our business portfolio and see what the optimal mix is of businesses. We have a lot of execution to do and value to rebuild right now. And we get some financial synergy out of the diversification of cash flows to the holding company from both the MI side, and also back to our last conversation of what we see in Insurance and Wealth Management that we really want to get companies back to paying a regular dividend to the holding company.

I'll take that. When you think about our overall loss mitigation efforts, we have through this cycle been focused on, number one, what was coming through in the delinquencies and investigating those and making sure loans were properly underwritten. So that sort of worked itself through the system. As of about the second quarter of 2010, most of our material benefit was gone from rescissions. Now the loans are starting to make it through the delayed foreclosure process and starting to be perfected claims. And as we look at those claims and as we look at the way they were serviced, we're certainly looking at them very closely in terms of making sure that the servicers perform to the standards that are required in our master policy, and where we see that there were some problems in that servicing or breakdowns in the way it was that in the marketplace, and we all certainly read about that on a regular basis. We've been doing some curtailment of the claims trimming back on interest rated expense and other things, where frankly there was no focus put on the consumer. So we have beefed that up a little bit and are going to continue to look at all claims to make sure we're paying every single legitimate one, to make sure we're paying them consistently with our master policy. 
Now if you look at our supplement, just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, on the quarter, we probably paid 5,600, 5,700 claims in total, something like that. And with an average improvement from the prior quarter, as you referenced of about $6,000 per claim, you can get some handle on the impact that, that might have over time."

I think the -- so the latest thing around HAMP, I would view as net positive for the Mortgage Insurance industry. The HAMP program has been extended for another year. There's been additional flexibility provided around debt to income levels to qualify, which will bring more potential borrowers to the modification program potentially. Investor properties are available. So those things are all sort of net positive to us and, I think, should give us some additional run room on HAMP, which we thought was really sort of declining and petering out by the end of the year. The government has also offered some additional incentives by the treasury to investors who would write down and do some principal reductions. So far, none of that's really been taken up by the GSE. And so, I don't know that we'll get any additional benefit out of that really. But there's a lot of activity going on in Washington on trying to make sure you stay focused on the borrowers. The big huge refinance program that was offered by the administration this week doesn't really -- the GSEs and the agencies don't qualify for that, so I don't think we'll get a lot of benefit out of that as most of our portfolio is with both Fannie and Freddie. And I think that one's got a little bit of political headwind it's got to play through before those things get approved. But a lot of activity, we're staying focused on the activity that we've known has worked, which is we'll keep working with those borrowers and with the servicers to try and drive as many workouts as we can."

And I appreciate that you guys monetizing some gains on the statutory basis, and that's good that you're building capital. But is there any beyond that sort of capital build, is there visibility on cash flow recovery or statutory earnings improvement on a more sustained basis?"

Let me break it down on a few fronts. Because I'd like to start on statutory and move at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question and try to give you as thorough an answer as w",563,"Tom, this is Mike. Let me break it down on a few fronts. Because I'd like to start on statutory and move at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question and try to give you as thorough an answer as we can. First on the statutory side, as we laid out and we're going to lay out in quite a bit more detail on the second call today, in fact, providing you some exhibits that I think the investment community will find very helpful to see how we're thinking about statutory earnings, unassigned surplus and the path towards both improvements on both MSI and surplus in the stock front and how that results then in the common dividend, you'll see a roadmap, if you will, on that front. So we're very focused on that. And that's really an underpinning because if you look at it we've had good dividend flows, well, good capital generation and in subsequent dividend flows from the International Protection business. We have it from our non-insurance business, Wealth Management and then reestablishing that on the U.S. life side, all aims quickly comes up through the Insurance and Wealthy Management division. And then, again, out of Canada and Australia, we've seen good capital generation and dividend performance along with that. So those statutory and capital generation underpinnings are the foundation. When you get up to the holding company level and you think about the risk buffers we have, as Marty laid out, we're running about $400 million above our 2x debt service coverage cushion we want to have. And then what we do is we basically look at a stressed environment and say, what would happen if the bulk of your dividends didn't come up from your operating companies for, say, 18 months because of some macro event out in the environment, and what type of buffer would you want to have to be able to handle that. And I would equate to about -- let me talk about that risk buffer, about $300 million, so that's a way to think about that and hence, Marty's commentary. As you move over that, because you still have the mixed up dividend that Marty talked about, we still have the closing of the GFIS sale coming. We have the majority IPO of Australia that's moving down the track right in accordance with our plans. And you look at therefore additional amounts, you'd say, well, how would you think about those proceeds? Well, first, you'd look at the environment, say, did something change from the risk environment that change your perspective on that risk buffer I just laid out. 
Second, there would be what I'd say, would be a proportional deleveraging. And if you do a proportional deleveraging for a piece of business you sell, then you're protecting your coverage ratios and then you're protecting your leverage ratios within that 24 to 26 range that Marty talked about, and then you move to redeployment. So it's quite rigorous, statutory looking at dividend, going to the holding company, making sure we have the risk buffers, targeting redeployment because we see shareholder value creation in that redeployment but maintaining the appropriate coverage and debt ratios along the way. So sorry for the long explanation, but hopefully that's very helpful in seeing how we'd walk on that path."

We recognize that the year was a difficult one for shareholders and work to listen, gain feedback, intensify our efforts to improve both the performance and positioning of the company. 
We have taken important steps with the business portfolio and individual product lines to sharpen our focus, rebalance exposures, maintain or expand risk buffers and support capital generation and redeployment. We made progress in several areas with more work to do and will maintain an intense execution focus in 2012. 
There are many aspects of markets that one does not control. Today, I would like to highlight 4 important levers that we do control and actively utilize to improve future operating performance. 
First, we continue to reposition the business portfolio to maximize value over the medium to long term. We're pursuing a number of steps to better align businesses, enhance risk profiles and reallocate capital to support shareholder value. 
Second, we are managing the volume and mix of new business, repricing products actively, utilizing reinsurance strategically and managing expenses, all to maximize profitability, benefit statutory performance and improve our capital generation use and return profile. 
Third, we are managing the in-force portfolio through loss mitigation strategies, repricing actions, life insurance block transactions and active management of investment exposures. 
And fourth, we are taking actions to add to our enterprise and holding company strength by expanding risk buffers and managing overall risk exposures and capital effectively. A key focus here is adding to our capital flexibility and distributable earnings profile to support dividends to the holding company, which benefits shareholders and bondholders. As you saw in our earnings release, we resegmented our financials this quarter. This reflects moves to align businesses to maximize operational and financial synergies. 
We are now operating through 3 divisions with 6 underlying reporting segments. There are clear benefits from our new structure. On the product and risk management front, we're getting better transfer of ideas, analytics and mortgage insurance loss mitigation strategies under this alignment. From a financial synergy standpoint, we now have an approach in place that accelerates use of our tax assets. And we have been able to improve the efficiency of capital structures. 
I'd like to provide some perspectives on the 4 key leverage we control and how they impact each division. Starting with Insurance and Wealth Management, I'm pleased with the progress we are making to reposition the portfolio. We have exited non-strategic lines, such as variable annuities and Medicare supplement, to better concentrate on our strongest market positions. We continued this in January with the announced sale of our tax and accounting advisors unit, Genworth Financial Investment Services or GFIS. 
This sale will allow us to focus on our core turnkey asset management businesses. We expect to receive $79 million in proceeds from this transaction and have an additional earnout opportunity. We are being selective regarding new business. We have implemented product design changes and repriced many products across life and long-term-care insurance, as well as fixed annuities and have chosen not to follow certain competitor price changes. 
In long-term care insurance, we introduced our next-generation product with higher pricing to reflect today's lower interest rates while continuing a focus on preferred risks. 
In the International Protection, we are focused on improving pricing and risk-sharing arrangements and changed the business model to withstand higher unemployment. Given revenue pressure from the low-growth environment in Europe, we are entering or considering select new countries through reinsurance or small capital investments to rebalance our European concentration over time and support segment revenues. 
We are managing our in-force portfolio and long-term care through care management and are executing our second round of price actions where we have received approval in 39 states. 
And in Lifestyle Protection, margins have improved nicely over full year 2010 given pricing risk and cost actions. 
Finally, we remain focused on managing product mix, transactions and platforms outside the U.S. life companies to maximize statutory earnings and improve capital profiles. 
We expect to continue shifting sales mix between life and long-term care versus attractively-priced fixed annuities that are less capital-intensive. We are utilizing reinsurance actively in life and long-term-care insurance to optimize new business capital needs. In addition, targeted transactions have improved and will continue to add to life company on the signed surplus. This include the gains from unwinding and resetting forward-starting interest rate swaps and the first life block transaction, which Marty will discuss in more detail. 
Finally, sound operating dividend generation by international protection and wealth management benefit the holding company. 
Turning to International Mortgage Insurance. We continue to move forward with our planned minority interest IPO of up to 40% of Australia mortgage insurance. We still anticipate second quarter 2012 execution. 
We have not encountered any regulatory or market conditions that would change that timing. The planned IPO supports objectives to rebalance the portfolio, maintain control of our strategic mortgage insurance platforms in Australia and Canada, add to risk buffers if conditions warrant and redeploy capital. 
Regarding new business, we have maintained pricing discipline and guidelines in a competitive environment. 
In Canada, we are working to gradually rebuild share as government guideline changes, such as lower amortization product and lower LTVs and refinancings, have contributed to a smaller market. Australia has seen a larger origination market, and we renewed a number of key commercial relationships during the year while maintaining pricing discipline.  In Europe, we reduced new business over time, given the economic environment and stopped writing in some countries. 
We continue to manage the in-force portfolio to minimize losses through our loss mitigation activities such as workouts, settlements and asset management. 
On the capital front, International Mortgage Insurance achieved its dividend goals and remains a strong generator of capital as large older books season and smaller new books are written. We are also managing our capital and risk through the establishment and use of global external reinsurance markets in certain countries. So as we look forward over the next few years, we expect capital generation to increase from these platforms. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we saw improved financial performance over the past 2 quarters. But there is still a way to go here for recovery given the tough market. Our focus remains on risk containment of the in-force portfolio and claims-paying ability. On this front, we remain active in the area of loss mitigation and continue to derive substantial results with the year-to-date benefits reaching $567 million. 
In assessing our in-force book, we place a strong emphasis on internal and third-party analysis of our claims-paying ability. And we continue to see adequate claims-paying ability and positive value in the business platform, which Kevin will discuss in greater detail on our February 10 call on USMI. We saw an increase in flow new insurance written over the prior year and prior quarter. Mortgage Insurance penetration is up versus the FHA, especially in the purchase market. 
We estimate that our market share is flat, despite reallocations after exits by competitors, as we have maintained our pricing and guideline discipline. And our post-2008 books of business are very profitable, significantly outperforming expectations. 
Regarding our ability to write new business, a complete evaluation must take into account several factors, including risk to capital, claims-paying ability, assessment of where books of business are in the loss curve and, finally, capital alternatives. 
We invest appropriate time with regulators, customers and others to help support this comprehensive assessment approach. We have the following alternatives to support new business currently. First, we currently maintain regulatory waivers or other authorizations from 44 states that permit the company to continue writing new business while its risk-to-capital ratio exceeds 25:1. 
Second, we have a subsidiary called Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, which has capital supporting approximately one year of new business capacity nationwide depending on new volume levels. This entity can be used with GSE approval. And currently, 5 states are being written out of GRMAC. 
Third, we continue to work constructively with GSEs and regulators on creating additional flexibility through alternative structures that support future business, which could be funded internally, externally or through a combination of the 2. We also maintain the 4 demanding screens discussed on our prior calls, which would inform any future decision to provide additional capital support to the USMI business. 
As we outlined last quarter, given the alternatives in place and our adequate claims-paying resources, we have no plans to contribute capital to USMI. 
Finally, we have made ongoing progress in building buffers and managing overall capital and risk profiles at the holding company and operating businesses. At the holding company, we ended the year with approximately $950 million of cash or highly liquid securities, up $250 million from third quarter. The increase was driven by a series of actions taken throughout 2011. 
We have continued to actively manage our investment portfolio, reducing certain exposures, particularly in financials, and believe our European portfolio is well positioned. We've also managed our capital levels carefully at the operating platform level and been very active over the past 10 years in executing forward interest-rate hedges to protect against low-rate environments. We will go into further detail on the second call later this morning in how we are managing our exposures on the European asset and liability side as well as how we are addressing the low-interest-rate environment. 
We have also streamlined costs across our platforms to enhance competitiveness, adjust to the realities of slower markets and match a more concentrated product and distribution focus. All of our strategies and steps across our 4 levers to improve business alignment and reposition the portfolio, be selective regarding new business, manage the in-force intensively, add to risk buffers at the holding company and pursue targeted capital strategies support our goal of accelerating redeployment of capital and improving shareholder value. 
It's fair to say that 2011 was a challenging year from a market standpoint and a humbling year from my seat. Through the year, we intensified our focus and actions to improve Genworth. While we have made progress, we recognize that more work remains, and so must our intensity. Through enhanced focus, our business platforms today are deeper and stronger within their large target markets. We also have made a number of moves on the people front to strengthen the team and our capabilities. So our commitment remains one of driving execution, taking the steps we need to and building value. 
Now let me turn it over to Marty. Marty?"

I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. I'll start with the Insurance",2109,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. 
I'll start with the Insurance and Wealth Management division, where operating earnings increased 12% from the prior year to $145 million, driven by results in the U.S. Life Insurance segment. Operating earnings were down sequentially, mainly from International Protection and results in the Life Insurance business. Insurance earnings were $60 million for the quarter. We continued to see sound new business performance impacting our results as well as favorable mortality experience versus pricing. 
Term UL and other universal life sales were down approximately 4% from the third quarter. We expect sales to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to our previous pricing actions and capital discipline. We continued to use reinsurance on new business to manage capital effectively and expect a capital benefit of approximately $25 million per quarter in 2012. 
In addition, we are completing our first life block transaction, which will generate approximately $100 million in initial aftertax capital benefits for the life companies. We have executed the reinsurance treaty and are redeeming associated bonds under the terms of last month's successful bond tender. The transaction will be completed in the next few weeks. 
Long-term care earnings were $38 million for the quarter. The reported loss ratio of 67% improved over the prior year and the prior quarter. We experienced low claim termination rates versus the prior year, but we did see lower new claims compared to the third quarter as well as an increase in active policy terminations, primarily in our older issued policies. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on a majority of the older issued policies has begun to take effect. 
We still expect the continued impact in 2012 at about $50 million in additional premium in 2012, and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We are closely watching the performance of the older business and will assess potential additional rate actions accordingly. We continued to see sound performance across the block of newer issued policies, with a loss ratio of 50%, in line with prior quarters. 
As we manage capital and risk, we use reinsurance on new business, reinsuring about 40% of the new long-term-care product. Fixed annuity earnings were $16 million as we adjusted for the state guarantee fund assessment. 
In December, we launched our new suite of index annuity products designed to further enhance our annuity product offerings. We expect to increase sales in 2012 by approximately 10% as we adjust the sales mix over products to build capital and statutory earnings in our life companies. 
International Protection reported earnings were flat to the prior year and decreased 24% sequentially due to top line pressure as European economic concerns reduced consumer and related insurance product sales. 
Despite the top line pressures, full year operating margins improved more than 360 basis points over 2010 results, returning to 2008 pre-recession levels. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter. All in, 2011 full year net flows were positive $1.4 billion despite a challenging environment and the negative net flows in the fourth quarter. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell Genworth Financial Investment Services, or GFIS, to Cetera Financial Group. GFIS accounted for about 14% of wealth management's earnings and about 11% of assets under management in 2011. 
Turning to capital. International Protection and Wealth Management paid $199 million in dividends to the holding company in 2011. With respect to statutory capital for the U.S. life companies, the unassigned surplus at year end is estimated to be in excess of $50 million. 
The RBC ratio topped 400% as we completed the sale of our Medicare supplement business during the quarter and also realized tax benefits from locking in gains on our forward-starting interest rate swaps. 
We still intend to dividend up to the holding company a significant portion of the proceeds from the Medicare supplement sale over the course of this year, subject to regulatory approval. As an important part of our strategy to reestablish ordinary dividend capacity from our life companies by 2013, we are working on executing several initiatives to grow capital, statutory earnings and unassigned surplus in order to restore this capacity. And we will expand on these in our 2012 business goals call. 
Moving to the International MI segment. Reported earnings were down by $20 million from the prior year, and earnings decreased to 24% when excluding FX. Underlying performance for the quarter was mixed. Unemployment rose slightly in Canada and was flat for Australia, while the housing markets were performing as expected. 
In Europe, the uncertain economic environment is creating pressure in some countries, particularly Ireland. 
In Canada, excluding FX, operating earnings for the quarter were down 15% from the prior year. The loss ratio increased 4 points sequentially to 40% from a reserve strengthening associated with higher severity on existing delinquencies. 
In Australia, excluding FX, operating earnings were down 9% from last year. The loss ratio decreased 2 points sequentially to 46%, reflecting a decline in new delinquencies. The delinquency rate improved across all regions sequentially. As part of our risk and capital management strategy, the Australian business continued to expand its reinsurance program. Combined, Canada and Australia paid dividends of $215 million to the holding company in 2011. And both platforms continue to generate capital as smaller books are written and the larger books continue to season. 
The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $15 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland from higher delinquencies. Ireland is seeing increased new delinquency development from prolonged economic stress and significant home price declines. After several years of limiting new MI business in Ireland, we stopped writing the business altogether midway through last year. 
In addition, we have been working to manage our exposure in Ireland through loss mitigation. We will expand on this subject as part of our discussion of the impacts of European exposure for our company on our second call this morning. 
Turning to USMI. Results continued to be impacted by weakness in the U.S. economy. Flow NIW increased to 23% over the prior year and 19% sequentially, reflecting the continued gradual shift away from the FHA and higher refinancing activity. 
Our estimated market share remains flat at about 40% as we maintain pricing discipline. Our total flow delinquencies decreased 1% sequentially, with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 to 2008 book years as well as a favorable impact from the geographic mix of new delinquencies in the quarter. Redefaults on modifications continued to be within our ultimate expected range of 25% to 30%. 
Shifts in the payment status or aging was relatively stable, while we did experience fewer net cures driven by declining loss mitigation, consistent with our reserve strengthening in the second quarter. Our average flow reserve per delinquency is relatively flat at $29,100, and our total amount reserve for flow delinquencies by category is consistent with the third quarter. 
Loss mitigation savings in the quarter eased to $147 million, with workouts declining 16% as HAMP modifications wind down. 
Our combined U.S. MI statutory risk-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8:1 in the quarter. GEMICO currently maintains waivers and other authorizations in 44 states. And we are now writing business in 5 states out of Genworth Residential Mortgage Assurance Corporation, or GRMAC, a subsidiary of GEMICO. Those 5 states account for about 10% of NIW. 
In the quarter, GRMAC's capital increased modestly to approximately $76 million, and its risk-to-capital ratio is 1.6:1. We continue to believe that we have about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states in GRMAC. 
Moving to the corporate and runoff division. Improved variable annuity results, driven by better market performance, were offset by lower earnings from the sale of the Medicare supplement business as well as an aftertax goodwill impairment of $19 million related to the reverse mortgage business. This business was acquired in 2007 and offers products that provide liquidity and retirement income to senior market consumers. 
Shifting to investments. The global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were down slightly at 4.6% in the quarter. Results reflect lower limited partnership income as well as higher cash balances, which are being reinvested over the next few months. Impairments were down slightly in the quarter and from the prior year. We have $700 million or less than 1% of the portfolio in European periphery exposure, which is down $185 million from the third quarter, primarily due to opportunistic sales. 
Turning next to the holding company. We remain very focused on maintaining appropriate risk buffers. We also are making headway on our strategy to create further dividend streams to the holding company, particularly in U.S. Life Insurance. These are important steps in maintaining our financial strength for policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $950 million, which is about $400 million over our cash buffer target of 2x debt service coverage, and we expect to maintain a similar excess in this uncertain economic environment. While we are moving forward with the minority interest IPO of the Australian Mortgage Insurance business, our risk buffer plans are not dependent on this transaction. 
We continue to navigate the company towards a long-term leverage ratio in the 24% to 26% range, which is equivalent to our previously communicated range of 22% to 24% adjusted for the new DAC guidance. The holding company received $478 million in dividends in 2011. 
Let me now cover some accounting changes being made in 2012. We are adopting the FASB's new debt guidance and expect the impact will be a reduction in retained earnings and stockholders equity of approximately $1.4 billion. 
We will defer fewer costs but record lower amortization. In describing the earnings impact going forward, there are 4 main drivers: sales growth, product duration, product mix and distribution mix. 
Relative to our competitors, we believe the expected impacts are similar in our life and annuity product lines but different in long-term care. Over the last couple of years, sales of our long-term care products have generally grown faster than many others in the industry. Additionally, the retail distribution channel is a relatively large percentage of our sales volume and is more negatively impacted from lead generation expenses that are no longer deferrable. 
While not impacting economic or statutory results, in 2012, we expect a negative impact on GAAP earnings from the new debt guidance of about $65 million to $75 million or about $0.13 to $0.15 per share with an impact of approximately $20 million to $25 million in Life Insurance and $25 million to $30 million in long-term care. We continue to evaluate a number of options for adjusting distribution and marketing structures to mitigate the effects of this new standard. 
Separately, we have changed our accounting for reserves on our level term life insurance products, which we no longer sell. Under the prior approach, profits emerged as a level percentage of premiums. And given the increasing premium stream in these products after the level premium period, policy reserves could become negative. 
While the amount of the negative reserves at year end was immaterial to the current balance sheet, over the years, the negative balances would have become much larger. While this approach is certainly compliant and consistent with industry practice at that time, more recent accounting models for long-duration contracts follow an approach which emphasizes the balance sheet over the income statement.  We believe the accounting policy under these more recent models is preferable, and so we will be flooring individual policy reserves at 0. 
We are making no changes to the assumptions which were locked in at the time these policies were issued. There will be a negative earnings impact of this new accounting policy of approximately $20 million to $30 million after tax annually in 2012 and in the following several years. However, we believe this approach is more conservative and reduces balance sheet risk. 
As with the new DAC accounting guidance, this policy affects only GAAP reported results, not statutory or economic results. The impact from future lapses, if higher than assumed, will be significantly reduced. 
In closing, with the transitions made through 2011, we are very focused on improving performance of our businesses and generating capital while managing our risks in an uncertain environment. I'd now like to open it up for questions."

We think the actions we've taken over last year and the contributions we've made in the last 12 months of the capital levels provide us with a nice quarter to navigate through. We have shared all of our forecasts and our expectation on risk-to-capital development with both our regulators and with the GSEs. And at this point in time, we think they're considering things beyond just risk-to-capital when they assess our ability to continue to write. So they look at our strength of our reserves. They look at the quality of our portfolio. They look at the profitability of the new business, which adds to our claims paying. They look at where we stand on the loss curve and other capital alternatives. So I can't give you any assurance on a 2-year period. The second part of your question, I think that's a little long. But I can tell you at this point in time, we expect to be able to continue to write. We got the benefit of GRMAC, our wholly-owned subsidiary below GEMICO, in the event that GEMICO runs into some problem on the waivers. And that gives us a little bit of extra cushion, which perhaps puts us on out into that 2nd year that you asked about."

And it's also benefiting from some deferred tax asset benefits around some of the forward-starting swap gains. So those 2 things together contributed largely to the increase. 
But really, paying a regular dividend doesn't relate so much to RBC ratios as it does to the level of unassigned surplus as well as to the statutory earnings that the companies have. We will talk more about this on our second call, but let me turn it over to Pat just to give you a little bit of sense for the development of unassigned surplus over the year and some other considerations."

We'll go through on the next call that there are a number of impacts in terms of shifting our mix of business, greater use of reinsurance. On a full year basis, I'd say the 2011 statutory earnings were below the level achieved in 2009 and 2010, primarily due to the equity market and low-interest-rate impacts, but -- and a moderately higher long-term-care loss ratio. But I would say that moving into the new year with the block transactions, with the shifts that we've made in our new business capital allocation, we're expecting to see that level climb to at or above the historical levels and position us very well for our target of returning to ordinary dividend paying on an ongoing basis in 2013."

If and as we renewed the facility, we'd be looking at something that's probably, order of magnitude, maybe 1/3 or perhaps even less than the current size. As we think about where we are with our risk buffers and holding company liquidity, we have really developed those and really don't actually need the credit facilities as they stand now given the liquidity that we have. What we'll do is we'll revisit credit facilities later in the year as we make progress on some of the things we're working on, including Australian IPO."

I'll take that. When you think about our overall loss mitigation efforts, we have through this cycle been focused on, number one, what was coming through in the delinquencies and investigating those and making sure loans were properly underwritten. So that sort of worked itself through the system. As of about the second quarter of 2010, most of our material benefit was gone from rescissions. Now the loans are starting to make it through the delayed foreclosure process and starting to be perfected claims. And as we look at those claims and as we look at the way they were serviced, we're certainly looking at them very closely in terms of making sure that the servicers performed to the standards that are required in our master policy.  And where we see that there were some problems in that servicing or breakdowns in the way it was that in the marketplace, and we all certainly read about that on a regular basis, we've been doing some curtailment of the claims, trimming back on interest rated expense and other things, where, frankly, there was no focus put on the consumer. So we have beefed that up a little bit and are going to continue to look at all claims to make sure we're paying every single legitimate one, to make sure we're paying them consistently with our master policy. 
Now if you look at our supplement, just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, on the quarter, we probably paid 5,600, 5,700 claims in total, something like that. And with an average improvement from the prior quarter, as you referenced, of about $6,000 per claim, you can get some handle on the impact that, that might have over time."

I think the -- the latest thing around HAMP I would view as net positive for the Mortgage Insurance industry. The HAMP program has been extended for another year. There's been additional flexibility provided around debt-to-income levels to qualify, which will bring more potential borrowers to the modification program potentially. Investor properties are available. So those things are all sort of net-positive to us and, I think, should give us some additional run room on HAMP, which we thought was really sort of declining and petering out by the end of the year. The government has also offered some additional incentives by the treasury to investors who would write down and do some principal reductions. So far, none of that's really been taken up by the GSEs. And so I don't know that we'll get any additional benefit out of that, really. But there's a lot of activity going on in Washington on trying to make sure you stay focused on the borrowers. The big huge refinance program that was offered up by the administration this week doesn't really -- the GSEs and the agencies don't qualify for that, so I don't think we'll get a lot of benefit out of that, as most of our portfolio is with both Fannie and Freddie. And I think that one's got a little bit of political headwind it's got to play through before those things get approved. But a lot of activity.  We're staying focused on the activity that we've known has worked, which is keep working with those borrowers and with the servicers to try and drive as many workouts as we can."

Let me break it down on a few fronts. Because I'd like to start statutory and move -- at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question, trying to give you as thorough an answer as w",565,"Tom, this is Mike. Let me break it down on a few fronts. Because I'd like to start statutory and move -- at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question, trying to give you as thorough an answer as we can. First on the statutory side, as we've laid out and we're going to lay out in quite a bit more detail on the second call today, in fact, providing you some exhibits that I think the investment community will find very helpful to see how we're thinking about statutory earnings, unassigned surplus and the path towards both improvements on both MSI and surplus in the stat [ph] front and how that results, then, in the common dividend, you'll see a roadmap, if you will, on that front. So we're very focused on that. And that's really an underpinning, because if you look at it, we've had good dividend flows -- well, good capital generation and then subsequent dividend flows, from the International Protection business. We have it from our non-insurance business, Wealth Management, and then reestablishing that on the U.S. life side, all aids what comes up through the Insurance and Wealthy Management division. And then, again, out of Canada and Australia, we've seen good capital generation and dividend performance along with that. So those statutory and capital-generation underpinnings are the foundation. When you get up to the holding-company level and you think about the risk buffers we have, as Marty laid out, we're running about $400 million above our 2x debt-service-coverage cushion we want to have. And then what we do is we basically look at a stressed environment and say, ""What would happen if the bulk of your dividends didn't come up from your operating companies for, say, 18 months because of some macro event out in the environment, and what type of buffer would you want to have to be able to handle that?""  And that would equate to about -- let me talk about that risk buffer, about $300 million.  So that's a way to think about that, and, hence, Marty's commentary. Now as you move over that, because you still have the mixed up [ph] dividend that Marty talked about, we still have the closing of the GFIS sale coming, we have the minority IPO of Australia that's moving down the track right in accordance with our plans. And you look at, therefore, additional amounts, you'd say, ""What -- how would you think about those proceeds?""  Well, first, you'd look at the environment and say, ""Did something change from the risk environment that changed your perspective?"" on that risk buffer I just laid out. 
Second, there would be what I'd say would be a proportional deleveraging. And if you do a proportional deleveraging for a piece of a business you sell, then you're protecting your coverage ratios and then you're protecting your leverage ratios within that 24 to 26 range that Marty talked about, and then you move to redeployment. So it's quite rigorous, statutory, looking at dividend, going to the holding company, making sure we have the risk buffers, targeting redeployment because we see shareholder value creation in that redeployment but maintaining the appropriate coverage and debt ratios along the way. So sorry for the long explanation, but hopefully that's very helpful in seeing how we'd walk down that path."

The first-hour call will be dedicated to a discussion of fourth quarter results. The second-hour call will begin at 11:00 a.m. after our Canadian subsidiary completes their earnings call. 
In the second call, we will focus on 2012, and specifically addressing low interest rates, European exposure, the statutory earnings profile of the life companies and key business goals for 2012. Also as a reminder, we will be holding a webcast on Friday, February 10 from 10:00 a.m. to noon on our U.S. Mortgage Insurance business. Please note our press release and financial supplement were released last evening and are posted on our website. 
This morning, you will hear from 2 of our business leaders, starting with Mike Fraizer, our Chairman and CEO; followed by Marty Klein, our CFO. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. In addition to our speakers, other key leaders will be available to take questions. They include Pat Kelleher, President and CEO of our Insurance and Wealth Management Division; Kevin Schneider, President of our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment; Jerome Upton, Chief Operating Officer of our International segment; Ron Joelson, Chief Investment Officer; and Buck Stinson, President, Insurance Products for our U.S. Life Insurance segment. 
With regard to forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial information, some of the statements we make during the call this morning may contain forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. We advise you to read the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC in February 2011.
This morning's discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be meaningful to investors. In our supplement and earnings release, non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP where required in accordance with SEC rules. And finally, when we talk about results for the International Protection and International Mortgage Insurance segments, please note that all percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange. 
And now, let me turn the call over to Mike Fraizer."

We recognize that the year was a difficult one for shareholders and work to listen, gain feedback, intensify our efforts to improve both the performance and positioning of the company. 
We have taken important steps with the business portfolio and individual product lines to sharpen our focus, rebalance exposures, maintain or expand risk buffers and support capital generation and redeployment. We made progress in several areas with more work to do and will maintain an intense execution focus in 2012. 
There are many aspects of markets that one does not control. Today, I would like to highlight 4 important levers that we do control and actively utilize to improve future operating performance. 
First, we continue to reposition the business portfolio to maximize value over the medium to long term. We're pursuing a number of steps to better align businesses, enhance risk profiles and reallocate capital to support shareholder value. 
Second, we are managing the volume and mix of new business, repricing products actively, utilizing reinsurance strategically and managing expenses, all to maximize profitability, benefit statutory performance and improve our capital generation use and return profile. 
Third, we are managing the in-force portfolio through loss mitigation strategies, repricing actions, life insurance block transactions and active management of investment exposures. 
And fourth, we are taking actions to add to our enterprise and holding company strength by expanding risk buffers and managing overall risk exposures and capital effectively. A key focus here is adding to our capital flexibility and distributable earnings profile to support dividends to the holding company, which benefits shareholders and bondholders. As you saw in our earnings release, we resegmented our financials this quarter. This reflects moves to align businesses to maximize operational and financial synergies. 
We are now operating through 3 divisions with 6 underlying reporting segments. There are clear benefits from our new structure. On the product and risk management front, we're getting better transfer of ideas, analytics and mortgage insurance loss mitigation strategies under this alignment. From a financial synergy standpoint, we now have an approach in place that accelerates use of our tax assets. And we have been able to improve the efficiency of capital structures. 
I'd like to provide some perspectives on the 4 key leverage we control and how they impact each division. Starting with Insurance and Wealth Management, I'm pleased with the progress we are making to reposition the portfolio. We have exited non-strategic lines, such as variable annuities and Medicare supplement, to better concentrate on our strongest market positions. We continued this in January with the announced sale of our tax and accounting advisors unit, Genworth Financial Investment Services or GFIS. 
This sale will allow us to focus on our core turnkey asset management businesses. We expect to receive $79 million in proceeds from this transaction and have an additional earnout opportunity. We are being selective regarding new business. We have implemented product design changes and repriced many products across life and long-term-care insurance, as well as fixed annuities and have chosen not to follow certain competitor price changes. 
In long-term care insurance, we introduced our next-generation product with higher pricing to reflect today's lower interest rates while continuing a focus on preferred risks. 
In the International Protection, we are focused on improving pricing and risk-sharing arrangements and changed the business model to withstand higher unemployment. Given revenue pressure from the low-growth environment in Europe, we are entering or considering select new countries through reinsurance or small capital investments to rebalance our European concentration over time and support segment revenues. 
We are managing our in-force portfolio and long-term care through care management and are executing our second round of price actions where we have received approval in 39 states. 
And in Lifestyle Protection, margins have improved nicely over full year 2010 given pricing risk and cost actions. 
Finally, we remain focused on managing product mix, transactions and platforms outside the U.S. life companies to maximize statutory earnings and improve capital profiles. 
We expect to continue shifting sales mix between life and long-term care versus attractively-priced fixed annuities that are less capital-intensive. We are utilizing reinsurance actively in life and long-term-care insurance to optimize new business capital needs. In addition, targeted transactions have improved and will continue to add to life company on the signed surplus. This include the gains from unwinding and resetting forward-starting interest rate swaps and the first life block transaction, which Marty will discuss in more detail. 
Finally, sound operating dividend generation by international protection and wealth management benefit the holding company. 
Turning to International Mortgage Insurance. We continue to move forward with our planned minority interest IPO of up to 40% of Australia mortgage insurance. We still anticipate second quarter 2012 execution. 
We have not encountered any regulatory or market conditions that would change that timing. The planned IPO supports objectives to rebalance the portfolio, maintain control of our strategic mortgage insurance platforms in Australia and Canada, add to risk buffers if conditions warrant and redeploy capital. 
Regarding new business, we have maintained pricing discipline and guidelines in a competitive environment. 
In Canada, we are working to gradually rebuild share as government guideline changes, such as lower amortization product and lower LTVs and refinancings, have contributed to a smaller market. Australia has seen a larger origination market, and we renewed a number of key commercial relationships during the year while maintaining pricing discipline.  In Europe, we reduced new business over time, given the economic environment and stopped writing in some countries. 
We continue to manage the in-force portfolio to minimize losses through our loss mitigation activities such as workouts, settlements and asset management. 
On the capital front, International Mortgage Insurance achieved its dividend goals and remains a strong generator of capital as large older books season and smaller new books are written. We are also managing our capital and risk through the establishment and use of global external reinsurance markets in certain countries. So as we look forward over the next few years, we expect capital generation to increase from these platforms. 
In U.S. Mortgage Insurance, we saw improved financial performance over the past 2 quarters. But there is still a way to go here for recovery given the tough market. Our focus remains on risk containment of the in-force portfolio and claims-paying ability. On this front, we remain active in the area of loss mitigation and continue to derive substantial results with the year-to-date benefits reaching $567 million. 
In assessing our in-force book, we place a strong emphasis on internal and third-party analysis of our claims-paying ability. And we continue to see adequate claims-paying ability and positive value in the business platform, which Kevin will discuss in greater detail on our February 10 call on USMI. We saw an increase in flow new insurance written over the prior year and prior quarter. Mortgage Insurance penetration is up versus the FHA, especially in the purchase market. 
We estimate that our market share is flat, despite reallocations after exits by competitors, as we have maintained our pricing and guideline discipline. And our post-2008 books of business are very profitable, significantly outperforming expectations. 
Regarding our ability to write new business, a complete evaluation must take into account several factors, including risk to capital, claims-paying ability, assessment of where books of business are in the loss curve and, finally, capital alternatives. 
We invest appropriate time with regulators, customers and others to help support this comprehensive assessment approach. We have the following alternatives to support new business currently. First, we currently maintain regulatory waivers or other authorizations from 44 states that permit the company to continue writing new business while its risk-to-capital ratio exceeds 25:1. 
Second, we have a subsidiary called Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, which has capital supporting approximately one year of new business capacity nationwide depending on new volume levels. This entity can be used with GSE approval. And currently, 5 states are being written out of GRMAC. 
Third, we continue to work constructively with GSEs and regulators on creating additional flexibility through alternative structures that support future business, which could be funded internally, externally or through a combination of the 2. We also maintain the 4 demanding screens discussed on our prior calls, which would inform any future decision to provide additional capital support to the USMI business. 
As we outlined last quarter, given the alternatives in place and our adequate claims-paying resources, we have no plans to contribute capital to USMI. 
Finally, we have made ongoing progress in building buffers and managing overall capital and risk profiles at the holding company and operating businesses. At the holding company, we ended the year with approximately $950 million of cash or highly liquid securities, up $250 million from third quarter. The increase was driven by a series of actions taken throughout 2011. 
We have continued to actively manage our investment portfolio, reducing certain exposures, particularly in financials, and believe our European portfolio is well positioned. We've also managed our capital levels carefully at the operating platform level and been very active over the past 10 years in executing forward interest-rate hedges to protect against low-rate environments. We will go into further detail on the second call later this morning in how we are managing our exposures on the European asset and liability side as well as how we are addressing the low-interest-rate environment. 
We have also streamlined costs across our platforms to enhance competitiveness, adjust to the realities of slower markets and match a more concentrated product and distribution focus. All of our strategies and steps across our 4 levers to improve business alignment and reposition the portfolio, be selective regarding new business, manage the in-force intensively, add to risk buffers at the holding company and pursue targeted capital strategies support our goal of accelerating redeployment of capital and improving shareholder value. 
It's fair to say that 2011 was a challenging year from a market standpoint and a humbling year from my seat. Through the year, we intensified our focus and actions to improve Genworth. While we have made progress, we recognize that more work remains, and so must our intensity. Through enhanced focus, our business platforms today are deeper and stronger within their large target markets. We also have made a number of moves on the people front to strengthen the team and our capabilities. So our commitment remains one of driving execution, taking the steps we need to and building value. 
Now let me turn it over to Marty. Marty?"

I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. I'll start with the Insurance",2109,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I will begin today with the segment results in the fourth quarter, then provide an update on the holding company and wrap up with a discussion on accounting changes impacting future quarters. 
I'll start with the Insurance and Wealth Management division, where operating earnings increased 12% from the prior year to $145 million, driven by results in the U.S. Life Insurance segment. Operating earnings were down sequentially, mainly from International Protection and results in the Life Insurance business. Insurance earnings were $60 million for the quarter. We continued to see sound new business performance impacting our results as well as favorable mortality experience versus pricing. 
Term UL and other universal life sales were down approximately 4% from the third quarter. We expect sales to continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 due to our previous pricing actions and capital discipline. We continued to use reinsurance on new business to manage capital effectively and expect a capital benefit of approximately $25 million per quarter in 2012. 
In addition, we are completing our first life block transaction, which will generate approximately $100 million in initial aftertax capital benefits for the life companies. We have executed the reinsurance treaty and are redeeming associated bonds under the terms of last month's successful bond tender. The transaction will be completed in the next few weeks. 
Long-term care earnings were $38 million for the quarter. The reported loss ratio of 67% improved over the prior year and the prior quarter. We experienced low claim termination rates versus the prior year, but we did see lower new claims compared to the third quarter as well as an increase in active policy terminations, primarily in our older issued policies. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on a majority of the older issued policies has begun to take effect. 
We still expect the continued impact in 2012 at about $50 million in additional premium in 2012, and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We are closely watching the performance of the older business and will assess potential additional rate actions accordingly. We continued to see sound performance across the block of newer issued policies, with a loss ratio of 50%, in line with prior quarters. 
As we manage capital and risk, we use reinsurance on new business, reinsuring about 40% of the new long-term-care product. Fixed annuity earnings were $16 million as we adjusted for the state guarantee fund assessment. 
In December, we launched our new suite of index annuity products designed to further enhance our annuity product offerings. We expect to increase sales in 2012 by approximately 10% as we adjust the sales mix over products to build capital and statutory earnings in our life companies. 
International Protection reported earnings were flat to the prior year and decreased 24% sequentially due to top line pressure as European economic concerns reduced consumer and related insurance product sales. 
Despite the top line pressures, full year operating margins improved more than 360 basis points over 2010 results, returning to 2008 pre-recession levels. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter. All in, 2011 full year net flows were positive $1.4 billion despite a challenging environment and the negative net flows in the fourth quarter. 
Last month, we announced an agreement to sell Genworth Financial Investment Services, or GFIS, to Cetera Financial Group. GFIS accounted for about 14% of wealth management's earnings and about 11% of assets under management in 2011. 
Turning to capital. International Protection and Wealth Management paid $199 million in dividends to the holding company in 2011. With respect to statutory capital for the U.S. life companies, the unassigned surplus at year end is estimated to be in excess of $50 million. 
The RBC ratio topped 400% as we completed the sale of our Medicare supplement business during the quarter and also realized tax benefits from locking in gains on our forward-starting interest rate swaps. 
We still intend to dividend up to the holding company a significant portion of the proceeds from the Medicare supplement sale over the course of this year, subject to regulatory approval. As an important part of our strategy to reestablish ordinary dividend capacity from our life companies by 2013, we are working on executing several initiatives to grow capital, statutory earnings and unassigned surplus in order to restore this capacity. And we will expand on these in our 2012 business goals call. 
Moving to the International MI segment. Reported earnings were down by $20 million from the prior year, and earnings decreased to 24% when excluding FX. Underlying performance for the quarter was mixed. Unemployment rose slightly in Canada and was flat for Australia, while the housing markets were performing as expected. 
In Europe, the uncertain economic environment is creating pressure in some countries, particularly Ireland. 
In Canada, excluding FX, operating earnings for the quarter were down 15% from the prior year. The loss ratio increased 4 points sequentially to 40% from a reserve strengthening associated with higher severity on existing delinquencies. 
In Australia, excluding FX, operating earnings were down 9% from last year. The loss ratio decreased 2 points sequentially to 46%, reflecting a decline in new delinquencies. The delinquency rate improved across all regions sequentially. As part of our risk and capital management strategy, the Australian business continued to expand its reinsurance program. Combined, Canada and Australia paid dividends of $215 million to the holding company in 2011. And both platforms continue to generate capital as smaller books are written and the larger books continue to season. 
The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $15 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland from higher delinquencies. Ireland is seeing increased new delinquency development from prolonged economic stress and significant home price declines. After several years of limiting new MI business in Ireland, we stopped writing the business altogether midway through last year. 
In addition, we have been working to manage our exposure in Ireland through loss mitigation. We will expand on this subject as part of our discussion of the impacts of European exposure for our company on our second call this morning. 
Turning to USMI. Results continued to be impacted by weakness in the U.S. economy. Flow NIW increased to 23% over the prior year and 19% sequentially, reflecting the continued gradual shift away from the FHA and higher refinancing activity. 
Our estimated market share remains flat at about 40% as we maintain pricing discipline. Our total flow delinquencies decreased 1% sequentially, with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 to 2008 book years as well as a favorable impact from the geographic mix of new delinquencies in the quarter. Redefaults on modifications continued to be within our ultimate expected range of 25% to 30%. 
Shifts in the payment status or aging was relatively stable, while we did experience fewer net cures driven by declining loss mitigation, consistent with our reserve strengthening in the second quarter. Our average flow reserve per delinquency is relatively flat at $29,100, and our total amount reserve for flow delinquencies by category is consistent with the third quarter. 
Loss mitigation savings in the quarter eased to $147 million, with workouts declining 16% as HAMP modifications wind down. 
Our combined U.S. MI statutory risk-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8:1 in the quarter. GEMICO currently maintains waivers and other authorizations in 44 states. And we are now writing business in 5 states out of Genworth Residential Mortgage Assurance Corporation, or GRMAC, a subsidiary of GEMICO. Those 5 states account for about 10% of NIW. 
In the quarter, GRMAC's capital increased modestly to approximately $76 million, and its risk-to-capital ratio is 1.6:1. We continue to believe that we have about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states in GRMAC. 
Moving to the corporate and runoff division. Improved variable annuity results, driven by better market performance, were offset by lower earnings from the sale of the Medicare supplement business as well as an aftertax goodwill impairment of $19 million related to the reverse mortgage business. This business was acquired in 2007 and offers products that provide liquidity and retirement income to senior market consumers. 
Shifting to investments. The global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were down slightly at 4.6% in the quarter. Results reflect lower limited partnership income as well as higher cash balances, which are being reinvested over the next few months. Impairments were down slightly in the quarter and from the prior year. We have $700 million or less than 1% of the portfolio in European periphery exposure, which is down $185 million from the third quarter, primarily due to opportunistic sales. 
Turning next to the holding company. We remain very focused on maintaining appropriate risk buffers. We also are making headway on our strategy to create further dividend streams to the holding company, particularly in U.S. Life Insurance. These are important steps in maintaining our financial strength for policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $950 million, which is about $400 million over our cash buffer target of 2x debt service coverage, and we expect to maintain a similar excess in this uncertain economic environment. While we are moving forward with the minority interest IPO of the Australian Mortgage Insurance business, our risk buffer plans are not dependent on this transaction. 
We continue to navigate the company towards a long-term leverage ratio in the 24% to 26% range, which is equivalent to our previously communicated range of 22% to 24% adjusted for the new DAC guidance. The holding company received $478 million in dividends in 2011. 
Let me now cover some accounting changes being made in 2012. We are adopting the FASB's new debt guidance and expect the impact will be a reduction in retained earnings and stockholders equity of approximately $1.4 billion. 
We will defer fewer costs but record lower amortization. In describing the earnings impact going forward, there are 4 main drivers: sales growth, product duration, product mix and distribution mix. 
Relative to our competitors, we believe the expected impacts are similar in our life and annuity product lines but different in long-term care. Over the last couple of years, sales of our long-term care products have generally grown faster than many others in the industry. Additionally, the retail distribution channel is a relatively large percentage of our sales volume and is more negatively impacted from lead generation expenses that are no longer deferrable. 
While not impacting economic or statutory results, in 2012, we expect a negative impact on GAAP earnings from the new debt guidance of about $65 million to $75 million or about $0.13 to $0.15 per share with an impact of approximately $20 million to $25 million in Life Insurance and $25 million to $30 million in long-term care. We continue to evaluate a number of options for adjusting distribution and marketing structures to mitigate the effects of this new standard. 
Separately, we have changed our accounting for reserves on our level term life insurance products, which we no longer sell. Under the prior approach, profits emerged as a level percentage of premiums. And given the increasing premium stream in these products after the level premium period, policy reserves could become negative. 
While the amount of the negative reserves at year end was immaterial to the current balance sheet, over the years, the negative balances would have become much larger. While this approach is certainly compliant and consistent with industry practice at that time, more recent accounting models for long-duration contracts follow an approach which emphasizes the balance sheet over the income statement.  We believe the accounting policy under these more recent models is preferable, and so we will be flooring individual policy reserves at 0. 
We are making no changes to the assumptions which were locked in at the time these policies were issued. There will be a negative earnings impact of this new accounting policy of approximately $20 million to $30 million after tax annually in 2012 and in the following several years. However, we believe this approach is more conservative and reduces balance sheet risk. 
As with the new DAC accounting guidance, this policy affects only GAAP reported results, not statutory or economic results. The impact from future lapses, if higher than assumed, will be significantly reduced. 
In closing, with the transitions made through 2011, we are very focused on improving performance of our businesses and generating capital while managing our risks in an uncertain environment. I'd now like to open it up for questions."

We think the actions we've taken over last year and the contributions we've made in the last 12 months of the capital levels provide us with a nice quarter to navigate through. We have shared all of our forecasts and our expectation on risk-to-capital development with both our regulators and with the GSEs. And at this point in time, we think they're considering things beyond just risk-to-capital when they assess our ability to continue to write. So they look at our strength of our reserves. They look at the quality of our portfolio. They look at the profitability of the new business, which adds to our claims paying. They look at where we stand on the loss curve and other capital alternatives. So I can't give you any assurance on a 2-year period. The second part of your question, I think that's a little long. But I can tell you at this point in time, we expect to be able to continue to write.

We saw that rebound in the fourth quarter, in addition to the factors that Marty described as well. We'll go through on the next call that there are a number of impacts in terms of shifting our mix of business, greater use of reinsurance. On a full year basis, I'd say the 2011 statutory earnings were below the level achieved in 2009 and 2010, primarily due to the equity market and low-interest-rate impacts, but -- and a moderately higher long-term-care loss ratio. But I would say that moving into the new year with the block transactions, with the shifts that we've made in our new business capital allocation, we're expecting to see that level climb to at or above the historical levels and position us very well for our target of returning to ordinary dividend paying on an ongoing basis in 2013."

And that's one of the important reasons we augment not only our analysis of that, but use third-party analysis to do that. So we think we have strong claims-paying ability in place. We think we have a good quarter for new business that takes us out a year-plus, as Kevin talked about. We have -- I touched upon constructive discussions going on with GSEs and others about some alternative structures that add to that capitol flexibility. So I think we're in a good position right now to write this profitable new business, to manage through our in-force with strong loss mitigation.

First, what I wanted to convey regarding mortgage insurance is that we have seen benefit in having multiple platforms because of the diversification of risk that provides, certainly, we move know-how around the world. In fact, that diversification has helped us to be able to work with third-party reinsurers and, really, from nowhere, create an external global MI reinsurance market that we think can benefit certainly ourselves and over time, the entire industry. So that's what I wanted to convey. We will, as I think we have over time, always reassess our business portfolio and see what the optimal mix is of businesses. We have a lot of execution to do and value to rebuild right now. And we get some financial synergy out of the diversification of cash flows to the holding company from both the MI side and also, back to our last conversation of what we see in Insurance and Wealth Management, that we really want to get companies back to paying a regular dividend to the holding company. So we'll evaluate any changes in the portfolio, including do you get a better value for shareholders with a pure-play type structure down the road?

I'll take that. When you think about our overall loss mitigation efforts, we have through this cycle been focused on, number one, what was coming through in the delinquencies and investigating those and making sure loans were properly underwritten. So that sort of worked itself through the system. As of about the second quarter of 2010, most of our material benefit was gone from rescissions. Now the loans are starting to make it through the delayed foreclosure process and starting to be perfected claims. And as we look at those claims and as we look at the way they were serviced, we're certainly looking at them very closely in terms of making sure that the servicers performed to the standards that are required in our master policy.  And where we see that there were some problems in that servicing or breakdowns in the way it was that in the marketplace, and we all certainly read about that on a regular basis, we've been doing some curtailment of the claims, trimming back on interest rated expense and other things, where, frankly, there was no focus put on the consumer. So we have beefed that up a little bit and are going to continue to look at all claims to make sure we're paying every single legitimate one, to make sure we're paying them consistently with our master policy. 
Now if you look at our supplement, just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, on the quarter, we probably paid 5,600, 5,700 claims in total, something like that. And with an average improvement from the prior quarter, as you referenced, of about $6,000 per claim, you can get some handle on the impact that, that might have over time."

I think the -- the latest thing around HAMP I would view as net positive for the Mortgage Insurance industry. The HAMP program has been extended for another year. There's been additional flexibility provided around debt-to-income levels to qualify, which will bring more potential borrowers to the modification program potentially. Investor properties are available. So those things are all sort of net-positive to us and, I think, should give us some additional run room on HAMP, which we thought was really sort of declining and petering out by the end of the year. The government has also offered some additional incentives by the treasury to investors who would write down and do some principal reductions. So far, none of that's really been taken up by the GSEs. And so I don't know that we'll get any additional benefit out of that, really. But there's a lot of activity going on in Washington on trying to make sure you stay focused on the borrowers. The big huge refinance program that was offered up by the administration this week doesn't really -- the GSEs and the agencies don't qualify for that, so I don't think we'll get a lot of benefit out of that, as most of our portfolio is with both Fannie and Freddie. And I think that one's got a little bit of political headwind it's got to play through before those things get approved. But a lot of activity.  We're staying focused on the activity that we've known has worked, which is keep working with those borrowers and with the servicers to try and drive as many workouts as we can."

Let me break it down on a few fronts.

Let me break it down on a few fronts. Because I'd like to start statutory and move -- at the operating company level and then move towards the holding company and your redeployment question, trying to give you as thorough an answer as we can. First on the statutory side, as we've laid out and we're going to lay out in quite a bit more detail on the second call today, in fact, providing you some exhibits that I think the investment community will find very helpful to see how we're thinking about statutory earnings, unassigned surplus and the path towards both improvements on both MSI and surplus in the stat [ph] front and how that results, then, in the common dividend, you'll see a roadmap, if you will, on that front. So we're very focused on that. And that's really an underpinning, because if you look at it, we've had good dividend flows -- well, good capital generation and then subsequent dividend flows, from the International Protection business. We have it from our non-insurance business, Wealth Management, and then reestablishing that on the U.S. life side, all aids what comes up through the Insurance and Wealthy Management division. And then, again, out of Canada and Australia, we've seen good capital generation and dividend performance along with that. So those statutory and capital-generation underpinnings are the foundation. When you get up to the holding-company level and you think about the risk buffers we have, as Marty laid out, we're running about $400 million above our 2x debt-service-coverage cushion we want to have. And then what we do is we basically look at a stressed environment and say, ""What would happen if the bulk of your dividends didn't come up from your operating companies for, say, 18 months because of some macro event out in the environment, and what type of buffer would you want to have to be able to handle that?""  And that would equate to about -- let me talk about that risk buffer, about $300 million.  So that's a way to think about that, and, hence, Marty's commentary. Now as you move over that, because you still have the mixed up [ph] dividend that Marty talked about, we still have the closing of the GFIS sale coming, we have the minority IPO of Australia that's moving down the track right in accordance with our plans. And you look at, therefore, additional amounts, you'd say, ""What -- how would you think about those proceeds?""  Well, first, you'd look at the environment and say, ""Did something change from the risk environment that changed your perspective?"" on that risk buffer I just laid out. 
Second, there would be what I'd say would be a proportional deleveraging. And if you do a proportional deleveraging for a piece of a business you sell, then you're protecting your coverage ratios and then you're protecting your leverage ratios within that 24 to 26 range that Marty talked about, and then you move to redeployment. So it's quite rigorous, statutory, looking at dividend, going to the holding company, making sure we have the risk buffers, targeting redeployment because we see shareholder value creation in that redeployment but maintaining the appropriate coverage and debt ratios along the way. So sorry for the long explanation, but hopefully that's very helpful in seeing how we'd walk down that path."

Today I will provide an overview of the business and capital results in the first quarter. But first, I want to acknowledge and thank Mike Fraizer for his contributions to the company over the years. From his early day",2192,"Thanks, Georgette, and good morning. Today I will provide an overview of the business and capital results in the first quarter. But first, I want to acknowledge and thank Mike Fraizer for his contributions to the company over the years. From his early days at GE, through the IPO in 2004 and recent financial crisis. Under Mike's tenure as CEO, he has nurtured the commitment for making a difference for the people who rely on us most, customers, policyholders, employees, communities and industry. This has helped set a strong foundation to build from. Genworth has established a strong competitive position in our leadership lines, loyal customers and distributors, the very talented and dedicated group of employees across the company. With this transition, we will be very focused on executing the actions needed to rebuild value for shareholders as well as bondholders. We will continue to meet the needs of our customers while we improve the performance of our businesses, maintain strong liquidity and generate and manage capital. I look forward to working with the board and with our team to manage this transition. 
Now turning to results. First quarter saw good progress in U.S. Mortgage Insurance, stable performance in Canada as well as our investment portfolio, very disappointing results on Australia, which resulted in delay in the timing of our planned minority IPO. Unfortunately, it overshadowed the progress we made in other areas. 
I'll begin with the Global Mortgage Insurance division where the reported loss in the quarter was $36 million compared with net operating income of $16 million from the prior year. Let me give some perspectives on each of the mortgage platforms. In Australia, the operating loss was $21 million. Results reflected a $53 million after-tax impact from our service strengthening in Australia. This is driven by the combination of accelerated processing of delinquencies in our pipeline from 2011 through foreclosure declaim, along with higher current and anticipated the severity that we identified as we went deeper in individual claim cases during March and updated estimates for property price declines in certain submarkets, particularly in Queensland. The delinquencies we are dealing with are concentrated from geographic, and borrower profile standpoint. They are in Queensland in the 2007 and 2008 vintages and with small business owners and self-employed borrowers. Jerome will be talking in much more detail about the Transcend businesses results in Australia in just a few minutes. 
Before I move on, I'd like to discuss the frustration regarding Australia MI development. I appreciate your frustration and as part of our leadership transition, we will actively review and seek to improve our processes to avoid such frustration in the future. 
Turning now to Canada. Operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, down from $51 million in the prior year. Unemployment is trending lower and home prices are stable sequentially. In the quarter, the business experienced lower earned premiums as the larger 2007 and 2008 books of business continue to season. The loss ratio decreased to 2.6 sequentially to 38%, as overall delinquencies were down 5% from the prior quarter. I'd like to note that we maintain strong capital positions in both Australia and Canada. The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $9 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland. 
Moving to U.S. MI. Results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $43 million from a net operating loss of $96 million in the prior quarter and $83 million in the prior year. Flow NIW increased 50% over the prior year, this overall private mortgage insurance penetration improved but it was down 6% sequentially reflecting competitor pricing pressure on our market share in certain channels. Estimated market share remains flat in about 14% as we maintain our pricing and underwriting position. We continue to monitor the impact of competitor pricing on our market share. Our total floor delinquencies went down 11% from the prior year, with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn through of the 2005 through 2008 books. We default on modifications continued as expected. Loss mitigation savings in the quarter increased to $158 million as claims mitigation benefits offset a 5% decline in workouts as HAMP modification wind down. Our risk-to-capital in GEMICO was relatively stable, up about 0.5 points to 33.4:1 in the quarter. Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation or GRMAC is a subsidiary of GEMICO had capital increased modestly to approximately $78 million with the risk-to-capital ratio of 2.4:1 giving it about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states, pending our part level and regarding GSE approval. 
Shifting for a minute from quarterly results, I want to discuss some anxiety organization moves in our global MI division. As you know, we efficiently re-segmented our businesses around the need to be served into 3 divisions, Global Mortgage Insurance, Assurance in Wealth Management led by Pat Kelleher and Corporate Runoff. Now we're taking the next natural step in our MI businesses to reflect this alignment. So as you saw in separate press release, I'm very pleased to announce that Kevin Schneider will become President and CEO of the Global Mortgage Insurance division, bringing his experience and depth to the entire division. Gupta who is head of variety of roles in USMI and most recently served as Chief Commercial Officer of our product, pricing and marketing and sales take over as President of USMI. 
Let's turn back to results and discuss the Insurance and Wealth Management division with reported operating earnings of $81 million down from $127 million in the prior year. These results reflect the first life-block sale transaction which generated $170 million of statutory capital benefit and which generated an associated after tax GAAP net loss of $41 million. Excluding life block sales transaction, earnings in the quarter were $122 million. Life Insurance earnings were $47 million for the quarter, excluding the life block sale transaction loss, which is up from $42 million in the prior year. Firm UL and other universal life sales were flat compared to the fourth quarter. We expect sales to moderate going forward as we make further targeted changes to manage the sales mix and volume, in order to manage capital. Finally, we continue to use reinsurance and new business to manage capital effectively. 
Long-term care earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Overall results were consistent with the prior year with lower mortality being offset by higher premiums and a stable investment yields through hedging program. We had 2 reserve items in the quarter. The first item is a $10 million of favorable adjustment related to a systems conversion which is taking place in several stages. Second item is the $7 million increase in reserves associated with an improved methodology for incurred but not reported claims that will provide a better estimate of cost and reduced quarterly fluctuations going forward. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older policies begun to take effect. We still expect the continued impact in 2012 will add about $50 million in additional premium of which $10 million was reflected in the first quarter, and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We continue to closely watch the performance of the older business, and we'll assess the need for additional rate increases accordingly. 
The block of newer issued policies have the loss ratio of 52%. Finally, we reinsured about 40% of the new long-term-care product to manage capital and risk. Fixed annuity's earnings were $33 million as we had a favorable adjustment for the state guarantee fund assessment. These annuity sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter as we continue to manage new business to meet or exceed target returns in the low interest rate environment. International Protection earnings were $5 million, down from both the prior year and prior quarter. The underwriting margin decreased 7 points from both the prior year and prior quarter to 14%. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 7% versus the prior year, and increased of 13% versus the prior quarter primarily driven by Southern Europe, and a combined of less favorable claim reserve adjustment drove the loss ratio up 7 points in the quarter to 23%. Total revenue, excluding foreign exchange was flat versus the prior quarter and down 17% versus the prior year. There were several items in the quarter that we do not expect to impact this business going forward. Higher premium taxes related to a tax court ruling and lower tax benefits impacted the quarter by approximately $7 million in total. Additionally, although operating expenses were down versus the prior quarter, there was a $3 million impact related to resident expenses in additional profit share expenses. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, expense actions have been taken to mitigate these impacts. Wealth management earnings were $12 million for the quarter. Turning to capital, U.S. Life company risk-based capital ratio topped 425%, 20 points from year and as we completed the first life block sales transaction. The capital benefit of this transaction was larger than initially estimated due to refined estimates of these associated tax benefits. The unsigned statutory surplus at the end of the first quarter for the U.S. Life companies is estimated to be $215 million, while the consolidated statutory earnings for the first quarter is estimated to be $280 million, in line with statutory goals we laid out on our 2012 business goals call in February, the quarterly volatility. These goals are a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity for that revenues in 2013, this is  important to our shareholders and our bondholders. 
Finally, in the corporate runoff division result improved over the prior year from a variable annuity results driven by better market performance and favorable taxes. Shifting to investments, the global portfolio is performing well. For yields were 4.6% in the quarter, which is flat to the prior year and prior quarter as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships. We're happy that Dan Sheehan, with 18 years of broad and deep investment experience, has taken the role as our Chief Investment Officer, given Ron Jones' departure for another position. Over the last several years, Ron worked closely with Dan in our investment in for restructuring and dearest the portfolio. Ron has been a great colleague and friend and we thank him for his contributions to Genworth. 
Turning next to the holding company. We maintained ample liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of about $465 million over the prior quarter. This increase reflects approximately $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to the tax agreements with our operating companies, that we expect to be paid to the operating companies later this year. We executed a $350 million debt offering in March of this year, and continue to navigate towards a long-term leverage ratio between 24% and 26%. After the upcoming June debt maturity, our leverage ratio will be approximately 26%. I would like to offer some perspective on how we're thinking about the current cash position of the holding company. When adjusting for the temporary taxes that will be paid later this year, and the upcoming $222 million June debt maturity, holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balances currently designated for target of 2x debt service coverage which is about $600 million, and an additional buffer for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend source of the holding company over the next 18 months of approximately $350 million. After the quarter ended, we received approval from Delaware Regulators for an extraordinary cash dividend from the U.S. Life companies of $100 million which is paid to the holding company in April and is not part of the quarter end numbers. We also intend to receive approximately $70 million in cash from the sale of GFIS that was completed in early April. In close consultation with the board, we continue to actively evaluate these approach is to rebuild shareholder value including for example, share repurchases. With respect to repurchase, we have studies our cash resources and the flows of the holding company balance them against our debt service needs and liquidity targets, taking into account the delay in the Australian IPO. The results of this analysis that it is unlikely that we would commence the share repurchase program in 2012. 
To conclude, while we have made headwind in many of our objectives and seen improved results in some businesses, we have much work ahead. We must continue to manage debt story performance in the life companies, navigate the challenges in European economies and their impact on our results, and actively manage and monitor experience on Australia. I look forward to working with the board and with our team of very talented employees to improve performance, generate, manage capital and liquidity and rebuild the value of Genworth. 
Let me now turn it over to Jerome to discuss Australia's results and trends."

This morning, I will provide insights on our Australia Mortgage Insurance business the first quarter trends we observed where both the number of claims and the average claim payment increased significantly particularly in March, as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on the fault management. I will also be discussing the results of the portfolio review that was conducted given the first quarter trends that led to the reserve strengthening. I will conclude with some perspectives on business performance going forward. I will be referring to the Australia MI portfolio update presentation that has been posted to our investor website. 
Before I begin, please note the cautionary note with regard to the forward-looking statements and the basis for presenting financial information detailed on Slide 1. As shown on Slide 2, at the end of the first quarter, we had a little over $100 billion of effective risk with an overall portfolio delinquency rate of 0.54%. Our risk and force is dispersed across 4 major regions in line with the country's population and across several years of origination for vintages. Overall, our performance has been solid. However, we are seeing pressure in the Queensland region, and in the 2007 and 2008 vintages. When you drill down 1 level, our business performance is particularly impacted by the coastland Queensland area and small business and self-employed borrowers in the 2007, 2008 vintages, with each representing approximately 6% of total risk and force. I will provide more detail on these subsegments shortly. 
During late 2008 and through the first half of 2009, we strengthened guidelines and eliminated certain products which have improved performance of our most recent vintages. 
Turning to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we experienced higher losses primarily due to loss reserve strengthening of $82 million before taxes or $53 million on after-tax which was reviewed by independent third parties. The major drivers of this strengthening were: First, coastal Queensland economic downturn; two, small business, self-employed borrowers in the '07 and '08 vintages; third, the impact of lender servicing and programs; and fourth, the number of paid claims and severity. 
As you can see on Slide 4, the first key driver of the reserve strengthening was the impact of the coastal Queensland economic downturn on housing. We have identified these areas as the Far North, Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast which are principally tourist areas. You will observe the differentiated performance in these areas with peak to trough homes declines in double digits and even deeper declines on some of the 4 closed properties, as well as delinquency rates above the rest of Queensland in the overall portfolio. These areas have been hit hard by depressed tourism, particularly as the Australia dollar strengthened, lower levels of consumer and retail spending and reduced housing demand driving home prices lower. This is indicated on the left of this slide, as Queensland tourism has been particularly impacted through early 2011, but is showing early stages of recovery. This early stage recovery will not impact our delinquencies over the short term but should aid performance overtime as economic improvement work its way into the housing market. 
Turning to Slide 5, the deeper home price declines and higher average loan balances in coastal Queensland, when compared to the overall portfolio, our average paid claim on these properties is significantly higher than the overall portfolio. And a number of claims we paid as well as the average claim increased significantly on our first quarter of 2012, as we work with lenders to accelerate claim processing. 
As shown on Slide 6, second driver of the reserve strengthening was a small business of some light are in the 2007 and 2008 vintages. The segment is more relied on to resume, retail and consumer spending including rental income where these borrowers have investment properties. The lower levels of tourism and retail spending have reduced income levels on the segment and combined with higher cost of living in mortgage payments to the higher interest rates and created increased claims. On the left side of this page, we have provided details on our small business and self-employed borrower risk and force and you can see the levels included in the 2007 and 2008 vintages including Queensland, the Coastal Queensland concentrations as well as the higher delinquency rates. The impact of underwriting guidelines changes in 2008 and the first half of 2009 has significantly reduced risk and force for the segment that improve performance of more recent vintages. As you can see on the right, our average claim paid in the segment seems to be higher than the other portfolio and we have observed on increasing the number of claims paid in the average claim paid from fourth quarter to first quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 7. As we look forward to future claims development, we see delinquencies rates for the pressured subsegment such as the 2007 and '08 vintages, and the associated small business and self-employed borrower are stabilizing, allowing for the normal first quarter is seasonal increase. Newer vintages, especially 2010 and 2011 are seasoning very well at this point. In addition, we've seen improving profile going forward in the delinquency mix. On the right, we have provided some key metrics that have been produced with extensive analysis conducted on delinquency inventory. You will observe that Coastal Queensland accounts for 15% of the delinquent risk and force and later stage delinquencies categories while reducing the 10% and earlier stage delinquencies. Also, the 2007 and 2008 small business and self-employed borrowers will see  a corresponding improvement from 25% to 18%. Based on the work completed, we expect severities to decline as we work our way through the later stage delinquencies to the earlier stages. Of course, future claims development will be influenced by economic and housing market conditions as well as lender servicing. 
Moving to Slide 8. Another contributing factor was during late 2011 and into early 2012. We absorbed an extension of time from initial delinquency to claim payment with the 2 key drivers impacting the cycle: Lender servicing practices and forbearance programs. The normal cycle from delinquency is approximately 13 to 15 months, just now been expanded given current circumstances to 18 to 20 months. These delays increased our claims cost. During 2011, as delinquencies increased during the year, certain lender servicing routines fell behind which created processing delays and cost backlogs to delinquencies. In partnership with key lenders, we increased focus on default management and have seen a portion of these delinquencies come true in our first quarter results. In addition, the forbearance process sanctioned by the government has driven delays. This process allows borrowers the opportunity to submit a hardship dispute to an independent third-party to assist in its ultimate resolution. Collections and foreclosure proceedings must seize until a final determination on the hardship is reached. This can further extend the time decline payment and we are working with the government identify areas to improve the process and reduce the cycle time. 
In addition, we are actively working on servicing issues with key lenders by placing on-site resources to help accelerate decisions, advice on foreclosure strategies and improve delinquency the claim cycle time. 
As shown on Slide 9. In the first quarter of 2012, with a number of claims and the average claim payment increase significantly as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on default management. As you can see, this was more concentrated in March with a significant increase in the average claim payed as many of these claims also had higher loan balances. The observed increase in average claims size in March led us to conduct a comprehensive review of our delinquency inventory. 
Now turning to Slide 10. As a result of loss experience we saw emerge in the first quarter, we felt it necessary and prudent to strengthen loss reserves. Loss reserves are meant in an ultimate paid claims for reported delinquencies including a provision for incurred but not reported losses. In the quarter, we supplemented our normal quarterly actuarial review process with an extensive, loan-by-loan analysis of our delinquency inventory. This analysis included obtaining more up-to-date property valuations for all delinquencies, with adjustments to further stretch the home price and foreclosure. This analysis from the bases of the reserve strengthening of $82 million. It's important to note that our loss estimates assume no improvement in economic conditions and reserve adequacy maybe influenced by perspective changes in economic and housing market conditions. As you can see from the chart, the reserve adjustments were predominantly applied to the late stage delinquencies and loans currently in foreclosure, where we expect higher conversion rate to claim and higher claim severities. The limited strengthening its early stage delinquencies is supported by the changing delinquency mix profile and anticipated improving severity levels. You can think of the reserve strengthening in 2 categories: Claims and late stage delinquencies. Approximately $20 million of the reserve strengthening is related to claims to be paid during the second quarter with the residual applied to later stage delinquencies, majority of which will be paid over the remainder of the year. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Going forward, we will continue to thoroughly analyze our delinquency  inventory and update property valuations to assess or loss reserves. In addition, as mentioned earlier, we have on-site default management personnel at key lenders to help improve collections and optimize a loss mitigation decisions with an emphasis on loan workout activity, home sale prior foreclosure or an acceleration to claim. Finally, we will continue to adjust claims payment for cost outside of our policy, carefully monitor performance for small business and the self-employed borrowers as well as Coastal Queensland. 
Moving to Slide 12. As part of a deeper assessment of our portfolio, we look into other areas that could be sensitive to shifts in tourisms similar to Coastal Queensland. The results of this analysis are outlined in the table to the left, highlighting other specific tourist areas we have a much lower concentrations and lower delinquency rates. Looking broadly at the vintage analysis on the right side of the slide, you see down under performance of the 2007 and 2008 vintages would improving trends in more recent vintages. Overall, delinquency trends appear to be stabilizing. 
Now turning to Slide 13. The results for the quarter were disappointing with the reported operating loss of $21 million and a loss ratio of 154%. Stepping back from the quarterly results, our Australia Mortgage Insurance business has a history of producing strong annual results and our long-term views of this business and the market fundamentals have not changed. The revenue generation in the business is solid with over $1 billion under premium reserves and a strong investment portfolio producing investment income. In addition, we are in the process of implementing an approximate 7% price increase in the market. While we do expect to see elevated claim levels over the near term, we have used the current quarter loss emergence and other information to strengthen loss reserves we believe sufficient to cover these elevated claims. However, reserve adequacy will be dependent on future economic and housing market conditions, and the results for the next 2 quarters will be key task for these reserves. We do expect to produce an annual profit for 2012, but our quarterly results will be volatile with more  noted improvements in the second half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 14. As you can see, our capital level remains strong. Our estimated regulatory capital ratio at the first quarter is 153%. The 153% level is consistent with the ratios we reported throughout 2011. Over the past 18 to 24 months, in addition to building our capital, we have significantly diversify the capital profile in Australia, by raising $140 million of local Tier 2 debt and have significantly expanded our external reinsurance program, both in coverage levels and a number of participating reinsurers. At the in-force portfolio continues to season and is profits are generated going forward, we expect the Australian business to continue its strong generation of capital. 
Related to our planned dividend for the year, we'll expect the business to generate capital level sufficient to make the payment. However, this payment will be contingent on results for the year, approval by the Australia board and discussions with our regulator. The Australia dividend is less than 50% of the total international MI dividend for the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. We know there have been views expressed about a housing in Australia by certain parties. While others support the ongoing strength of the housing market, in this slide we highlighted the use of both bears and bulls as well as our own. Our views are: First, lending standards in Australia have remained strong with household formation driving housing demand. On a national level, there's a shortage of housing. The outlook for the economy remains solid, although we do expect continued areas of subregional pressure such as the coastal areas of Queensland. While home prices are high by historical measures, they have been supported by increased consumer purchasing power with home prices moderating since the second quarter of 2010. And while household indebtedness has increased, exposing consumers to rate shocks, the ratio of that disposable income has been relatively steady for several years in 150%. The majority of this that this mortgage related which can be repaid over a long period of time.  
In summary, we expect national home prices to be flat for 2012 allowing further digestion of historical home price increases. In closing, we are disappointed with the quarterly performance but our approach has been to make adjustments to put this issue behind us. Importantly, we must leverage the experience to improve our processes going forward. And in all of this, our long-term view of the Australia Mortgage Insurance business has not changed, the business and market fundamentals remain in place and are strong. Now, let me open the call up for Q&A."

So we've used our best information to book that $82 million, again to put it behind us but facts and circumstances could come true in the second and third quarter. That could call into question, that reserve adequacy, and we want to see 2 to 3 quarters come through to prove that out. Number two, the pressured segments that we're seeing, the '07 and the '08, both in Coastal Queensland and the Queensland in general, we see  stabilizing trend there, but again we want to see the proved points come through the second and third quarter. And again, in my prepared remarks, we took underwriting actions particularly related to some of the pressure points we saw in '07 and '08. And you've seen the recent vintages and the new vintage performance has improved as a result of that. So we'll be profitable for the year based on our best estimate. Right now, we're going to be very volatile in the quarter by quarter basis. I can't make the call but really, you want to see the next 2 to 3 quarters and proof come through on our reserve adjustment of $82 million, and the vintage, the '07 and '08 in Coastal Queensland come through we're seeing stability.

So the charts that we put up on USMI illustrate all of those trends that I just showed.

I guess the way that I look at this is that we reported income of $5 million for the quarter, Marty had indicated that there were several items, taxes, restructuring cost and one other item that are not expected to impact that business going forward. So when you adjust for that, the earnings if you look at it is about $15 million for the quarter, which is clearly down from the $19 million in the fourth quarter and about $25 million in the first quarter of last year. And that is primarily due to the loss ratio. And what I'd say is that there are several markets are several countries that are, I say, performing worse than the recent trends from an unemployment perspective and from an economy growth perspective. And that's what impacted our results. I'd look at it as a smaller version of what we saw in 2009 with the general downturn in Europe. And there, what we needed to do was a step back, look at our contracts and look at our ability to reprice and take measures to improve the profitability of the business going forward. While this is a lesser impact clearly than what we saw a couple of years ago we would take the same approach and expect improved underwriting results over a 3 to 4 quarter timeframe."

So if there could be some clarification there. And also, could you give us some concrete steps, one, two, three, what you're doing right now to enhance shareholder value."

I'll take those questions. I would say that Jim Riepe, who's our lead director and is also named nonexecutive chair, is very, very actively involved for quite some time and continue to be very involved and Jim and I speak multiple times as he does with other members of management. So he is very involved but he's leaving it to the management team to handle earnings call, which is typically the case. With respect to the sale of the company or other strategic aspects, I'd say that the most important thing we can be doing right now is improve the performance of our businesses, which is very important to give us the flexibility to execute various strategy. So working on the statutory performance of the light business to return to the ordinary dividend capacity, regular ordinary dividend capacity is very, very important. Working very actively on the turn in USMI to hopefully profitable next year and managing Australia losses, those are all very important things because as we manage those performances, we'll get a much better position to take better actions to improve shareholder value. The board in the meantime is very engaged on strategies, which could be ultimately a number of different things but ultimately we have to put ourselves in the place by building the financial strength of the company by improving performance. Thank you for your question. Oh, I'm sorry, I actually neglected it, to talk about your process change. We're very confident on our quarterly closing process, let me just start out with that. We are undertaking a review which will start beginning next week to make sure that our processes identify business trends as soon as absolutely possible. And if we're able to identify any of those improvements, we're simply going to make them, and we'll do that in our other businesses as well. We're certainly not aware of any process breakdowns, but we'll take a look at those and make the improvements accordingly. Thanks."

Today, I will provide an overview of the business and capital results in the first quarter.

Today, I will provide an overview of the business and capital results in the first quarter. But first, I want to acknowledge and thank Mike Fraizer for his contributions to the company over the years. From his early days at GE, through the IPO in 2004 and the recent financial crisis. Under Mike's tenure as CEO, he has nurtured the commitment for making a difference for the people who rely on us most: our customers, policyholders, employees, communities and industry. This has helped set a strong foundation to build from. Genworth has established a strong competitive positions in our leadership lines, loyal customers and distributors and a very talented and dedicated group of employees across the company. With this transition, we will be very focused on executing the actions needed to rebuild value for shareholders as well as bondholders. We will continue to meet the needs of our customers while we improve the performance of our businesses, maintain strong liquidity and generate and manage capital. I look forward to working with the board and with our team to manage this transition.
Now turning to results. The first quarter saw good progress in U.S. Life Insurance and U.S. Mortgage Insurance, stable performance in Canada as well as our investment portfolio, but very disappointing results on Australia, which resulted in delaying the timing of our planned minority IPO. Unfortunately, it overshadows the progress we've made in other areas.
I'll begin with the Global Mortgage Insurance division, where the reported loss in the quarter was $36 million compared with net operating income of $16 million from the prior year. Let me give some perspectives on each of the mortgage platforms. In Australia, the operating loss was $21 million. The results reflected a $53 million after-tax impact from the reserve strengthening in Australia. This is driven by the combination of accelerated processing of delinquencies in our pipeline from 2011 through foreclosure to claim along with higher current and anticipated severity that we identified as we went deeper in individual claim cases during March and updated estimates for property price declines in certain submarkets, particularly in Queensland.
The delinquencies we are dealing with are concentrated from geographic messenger [ph] and borrower profile standpoints. They are in Queensland in the 2007, 2008 vintages and with small business owners and self-employed borrowers. Jerome will be talking in much more detail about the trends and business results in Australia in just a few minutes.
Before I move on, I'd like to discuss the frustration investors have regarding the Australia MI development. I appreciate your frustration and as part of our leadership transition, we will actively review and seek to improve our processes to avoid such frustration in the future.
Turning now to Canada. Operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, down from $51 million in the prior year. Unemployment is trending lower and home prices are stable sequentially. In the quarter, the business experienced lower earned premiums as the larger 2007 and 2008 books of business continue to season. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 38% as overall delinquencies were down 5% from the prior quarter. I'd like to note that we maintain strong capital positions in both Australia and Canada. The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $9 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland.
Moving to U.S. MI. Results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $43 million from a net operating loss of $96 million in the prior quarter and $83 million in the prior year. Flow NIW increased 50% over the prior year as overall private mortgage insurance penetration improved, but it was down 6% sequentially, reflecting competitor pricing pressure on our market share in certain channels. Our estimated market share remains flat in about 14% as we maintain our pricing and underwriting position. We continue to monitor the impact of competitor pricing on our market share. Our total flow delinquencies went down 11% from the prior year with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 through 2008 book. Re-default [ph] on modifications continued as expected. Loss mitigation savings in the quarter increased to $158 million as claims mitigation benefits offset a 5% decline in workouts as HAMP modifications wind down. Our risk-to-capital in GEMICO was relatively stable, up about 25 points to 33.4:1 in the quarter. Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, which is a subsidiary of GEMICO, had capital increased modestly to approximately $78 [ph] million with the risk-to-capital ratio of 2.4:1, giving it about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states, depending on the production levels and requiring GSE approval.
Shifting for a minute from quarterly results, I want to discuss some exciting organization moves in our Global MI division. As you know, we efficiently re-segmented our businesses around the need to be served into 3 divisions: Global Mortgage Insurance; Insurance and Wealth Management, led by Pat Kelleher; and Corporate and Runoff.
Now, we're taking the next natural step in our MI businesses to reflect this alignment. So as you saw on separate press release, I'm very pleased to announce that Kevin Schneider will become President and CEO of the Global Mortgage Insurance division, bringing his experience in depth to the entire division. Rohit Gupta, who has had a variety of roles in USMI and most recently served as chief commercial officer of our product, pricing, marketing and sales, will take over as president of USMI.
Let's turn back to results and discuss the Insurance and Wealth Management division with reported operating earnings of $81 million, down from $127 million in the prior year. These results reflect our first life block sale transaction, which generated $170 million of statutory capital benefit and which generated an associated after-tax GAAP net loss of $41 million. Excluding the life block sale transaction, earnings in the quarter were $122 million. Life Insurance earnings were $47 million for the quarter, excluding the life block sale transaction loss, which is up from $42 million in the prior year. Term UL and other universal life sales were flat compared to the fourth quarter. We expect sales to moderate going forward as we make further targeted changes to manage sales mix and volume in order to manage capital.
Finally, we continue to use reinsurance and new business to manage capital effectively. Long-term care earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Overall results were consistent with the prior year with lower mortality, being offset by higher premiums and stable investment yields which were helped in part due to our hedging program. We had 2 reserve items in the quarter. The first item is a $10 million of favorable adjustment related to a systems conversion which is taking place in several stages. The second item is the $7 million increase in reserves associated with an improved methodology for incurred but not reported claims that will provide a better estimate of costs and reduced quarterly fluctuations going forward. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older-issued policies has begun to take effect. We still expect the continued impact in 2012 will add about $50 million in additional premium, of which $10 million was reflected in the first quarter and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We continue to closely watch the performance of the older business, and we'll assess the need for provisional additional rate increases accordingly.
The block of newer-issued policies had a loss ratio of 52%. Finally, we reinsured about 40% of the new long-term care product to manage capital and risk. Fixed annuities earnings were $23 million as we had a favorable adjustment for the state guarantee fund assessment. Fixed annuity sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter as we continue to manage new business to meet or exceed targeted returns in the low-interest rate environment. International Protection earnings were $5 million, down from both the prior year and prior quarter. The underwriting margin decreased 7 points from both the prior year and prior quarter to 14%. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 7% versus the prior year, but increased 13% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by Southern Europe and when combined with a less favorable claim reserve adjustments drove the loss ratio up 7 points in the quarter to 23%. Total revenue, excluding foreign exchange, was flat versus the prior quarter and down 17% versus the prior year. There were several items in the quarter that we do not expect to impact this business going forward. Higher premium taxes related to a tax court ruling and lower tax benefits impacted the quarter by approximately $7 million in total. Additionally, although operating expenses were down versus the prior quarter, there was a $3 million impact related to restructuring expenses and additional profit share expenses. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, expense actions have been taken to mitigate these impacts. Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter.
Turning to capital, U.S. Life Companies' risk-based capital ratio topped 425%, up 20 points from year-end as we completed the first life block sale transaction. The capital benefit of this transaction was larger than initially estimated due to refined estimates of the associated tax benefits. The unsigned statutory surplus at the end of the first quarter for the U.S. Life Companies is estimated to be $215 million, while the consolidated statutory earnings for the first quarter is estimated to be $280 million, in line with the statutory goals we laid out in our 2012 Business Goals Call in February with quarterly volatility. These goals are a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our Life Companies in 2013, which is  important to our shareholders and our bondholders.
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff division, results improved over the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by better market performance and favorable taxes. Shifting to investments, the Global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were 4.6% in the quarter, which is flat since the prior year and the prior quarter as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships.
We are happy that Dan Sheehan, with 18 years of broad and deep investment experience, has taken the role as our chief investment officer, given Ron Joelson's departure for another position. Over the last several years, Ron worked closely with Dan in our investment team to restructure and de-risk the portfolio. Ron has been a great colleague and friend, and we thank him for his contributions to Genworth.
Turning next to the holding company, we maintained ample liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of about $465 million over the prior quarter. This increase reflects approximately $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to tax [indiscernible] agreements with our operating companies that we expect to be paid to the operating companies later this year. We executed a $350 million debt offering in March of this year, and continued to navigate towards a long-term leverage ratio between 24% and 26%. After the upcoming June debt maturity, our leverage ratio will be approximately 26%.
I would like to offer some perspectives in how we're thinking about the current cash position of the holding company. When adjusting for the temporary taxes that will be paid later this year and the upcoming $222 million June debt maturity, the holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balance is currently designated for our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, and an additional buffer for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend sources to the holding company over the next 18 months of approximately $350 million.
After the quarter ended, we received approval from Delaware regulators for an extraordinary cash dividend from the U.S. Life Companies of $100 million, which is paid to the holding company in April and is not part of the quarter-end numbers. We also intend to receive approximately $70 million in cash from the sale of GFIS that was completed in early April. In close consultation with the board, we continue to actively evaluate various approaches to rebuild shareholder value, including, for example, share repurchases. With respect to repurchase, we have studied our cash resources and the flows of the holding company and balanced them against our debt service needs and liquidity targets, taking into account the delay in the Australia IPO. The results of this analysis indicate that it isn't [ph] unlikely that we would commence the share repurchase program in 2012.
To conclude, while we have made headwind in many of our objectives and seen improved results in some businesses, we have much work ahead. We must continue to manage debt historic performance in the Life Companies, navigate the challenges in European economies and their impact on our results, and actively manage and monitor experience in Australia. I look forward to working with the board and with our team of very talented employees to improve performance, generate and manage capital and liquidity and rebuild the value of Genworth.
Let me now turn it over to Jerome to discuss Australia results and trends."

This morning, I will provide insights into our Australia mortgage insurance business and the first quarter trends we observed, where both the number of claims and the average claim payment increased significantly, particularly in March, as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on default management. I will also be discussing the results of the portfolio review that was conducted given the first quarter trends that led to the reserve strengthening. I will conclude with some perspectives on business performance going forward. I will be referring to the Australia MI portfolio update presentation that has been posted to our investor website.
Before I begin, please note the cautionary note with regard to forward-looking statements and the basis for presenting financial information detailed on Slide 1.
As shown on Slide 2, at the end of the first quarter, we had a little over $100 billion of effective risk in-force with an overall portfolio delinquency rate of 0.54%. Our risk in-force is dispersed across 4 major regions, in line with the country's population and across several years of origination or vintages. Overall, our performance has been solid. However, we are seeing pressure in the Queensland region and the 2007 and 2008 vintages. When you drill down 1 level, our business performance is particularly impacted by the Coastal Queensland area and small business and self-employed borrowers in the 2007 and 2008 vintages, with each representing approximately 6% of total risk in-force. I will provide more detail on these subsegments shortly. During late 2008 and through the first half of 2009, we strengthened guidelines and eliminated certain products, which have improved performance of our most recent vintages.
Turning to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we experienced higher losses primarily due to loss reserve strengthening of $82 million before taxes, or $53 million after-tax, which was reviewed by independent third parties. The major drivers of this strengthening were: first, Coastal Queensland economic downturn; two, small business, self-employed borrowers in the '07 and '08 vintages; third, the impact of lender servicing and forbearance programs; and fourth, the number of paid claims and severity.
As you can see on Slide 4, the first key driver of the reserve strengthening was the impact of the Coastal Queensland economic downturn on housing. We have identified these areas as the Far North, Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast, which are principally tourist areas. You will observe the differentiated performance in these areas with peak to trough of homes price declines in double digits and even deeper declines on some of the foreclosed properties as well as delinquency rates above the rest of Queensland in the overall portfolio. These areas have been hit hard by depressed tourism, particularly as the Australia dollar strengthened, lower levels of consumer and retail spending and reduced housing demand, driving home prices lower. This is indicated on the left of the slide as Queensland tourism has been particularly impacted through early 2011, but is showing early stages of recovery. This early-stage recovery will not impact our delinquencies over the short term but should aid performance over time as economic improvement work its way into the housing market.
Turning to Slide 5. With deeper home price declines and higher average loan balances in Coastal Queensland, when compared to the overall portfolio, our average paid claim on these properties is significantly higher than the overall portfolio. And the number of claims we paid, as well as the average claim, increased significantly on the first quarter of 2012 as we work with lenders to accelerate claim processing.
As shown on Slide 6, the second driver of the reserve strengthening was a small business of self-employed borrower in the 2007 and 2008 vintages. This segment is more relying on tourism, retail and consumer spending, including rental income where these borrowers have investment properties. The lower levels of tourism and retail spending have reduced income levels on this segment and, combined with higher cost of living in mortgage payments to the higher interest rates, have created increased claims. On the left side of this page, we have provided details on our small business and self-employed borrower risk in-force and you can see the levels included in the 2007 and 2008 vintages, including Queensland and Coastal Queensland concentrations as well as the higher delinquency rates. The impact of underwriting guideline changes in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 has significantly reduced risk in-force for this segment and improved performance of more recent vintages. As you can see on the right, our average claim paid in the segment tends to be higher than the other portfolio, and we have observed an increase in the number of claims paid in the average claim paid from fourth quarter to first quarter.
Now turning to Slide 7. As we look forward to future claims development, we see delinquency rates for the pressured subsegments, such as the 2007 and '08 vintages and the associated small business and self-employed borrower, are stabilizing, allowing for the normal first quarter seasonal increase. Newer vintages, especially 2010 and 2011, are seasoning very well at this point. In addition, we see an improving profile going forward in the delinquency mix. On the right, we have provided some key metrics that have been produced by the extensive analysis conducted on the delinquency inventory. You will observe that Coastal Queensland accounts for 15% of the delinquent risk in-force in later stage delinquency categories, while reducing to 10% in earlier stage delinquencies. Also, for the 2007 and 2008 small business and self-employed borrowers, we see a corresponding improvement from 25% to 18%. Based on the work completed, we expect severities to decline as we work our way through the later stage delinquencies to the earlier stages. Of course, future claims development will be influenced by economic and housing market conditions as well as lender servicing.
Moving to Slide 8. Another contributing factor was, during late 2011 and into early 2012, we observed an extension of time from initial delinquency to claim payment with 2 key drivers impacting the cycle: lender servicing practices and forbearance programs. The normal cycle from delinquency to claim was on average of approximately 13 to 15 months, which has now been extended given the current circumstances to 18 to 20 months. These delays increased our claims cost. During 2011, as delinquencies increased during the year, certain lender servicing routines fell behind, which created processing delays and caused backlogs to delinquencies. In partnership with key lenders, we increased focus on default management and have seen a portion of these aged [ph] delinquencies come through in our first quarter results. In addition, a forbearance process sanctioned by the government has driven delays. This process allows borrowers the opportunity to submit a hardship dispute to an independent third-party to assist in its ultimate resolution. Collections and foreclosure proceedings must seize until a final determination when the hardship is reached. This can further extend the time to claim payment, and we are working with the government to identify areas to improve the process and reduce the cycle time.
In addition, we are actively working on servicing issues with key lenders by placing on-site resources to help accelerate decisions, advice on foreclosure strategies and improve delinquency to claim cycle time.
As shown on Slide 9. In the first quarter of 2012, both the number of claims and the average claim payment, increased significantly as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on default management. As you can see, this was more concentrated in March with a significant increase in the average claim paid as many of these claims also had higher loan balances. The observed increase in average claim size in March led us to conduct a comprehensive review of our delinquency inventory.
Now turning to Slide 10. As a result of loss experience we saw emerge in the first quarter, we felt it necessary and prudent to strengthen loss reserves. Loss reserves are [indiscernible] ultimate paid claims for reported delinquencies including a provision for incurred but not reported losses. In the quarter, we supplemented our normal quarterly actuarial review process with an extensive loan-by-loan analysis of our delinquency inventory. This analysis included obtaining more up-to-date property valuations for all delinquencies with adjustments to further stretch the home price and foreclosure. This analysis form the basis of the reserve strengthening of $82 million. It is important to note that our loss estimates assume no improvement in economic conditions and reserve adequacy may be influenced by perspective changes in economic and housing market conditions. As you can see from the chart, the reserve adjustments were predominantly applied to the late stage delinquencies and loans currently in foreclosure, where we expect higher conversion rates to claim and higher claim severities. The limited strengthening to early stage delinquencies is supported by the changing delinquency mix profile and anticipated improving severity levels. You can think of the reserve strengthening in 2 categories: claims and late stage delinquencies. Approximately $20 million of the reserve strengthening is related to claims to be paid during the second quarter with the residual applied to later stage delinquencies, the majority of which will be paid over the remainder of the year.
Now turning to Slide 11. Going forward, we will continue to thoroughly analyze our delinquency  inventory and update property valuations to assess our loss reserves. In addition, as mentioned earlier, we have on-site default management personnel at key lenders to help improve collections and optimize loss mitigation decisions with an emphasis on loan workout activity, home sale prior to foreclosure or an acceleration to claim. Finally, we will continue to adjust claims payments for cost outside of our Master Policy and carefully monitor performance for small business and self-employed borrowers as well as Coastal Queensland.
Moving to Slide 12. As part of a deeper assessment of our portfolio, we look into other areas that could be sensitive to shifts in tourism similar to Coastal Queensland. The results of this analysis are outlined in the table to the left, highlighting that in other specific tourist areas, we have much lower concentrations and lower delinquency rates. Looking broadly at the vintage analysis on the right side of the slide, we see the underperformance of the 2007 and 2008 vintages with improving trends in more recent vintages. Overall, delinquency trends appear to be stabilizing.
Now turning to Slide 13. The results for the quarter were disappointing with a reported operating loss of $21 million and a loss ratio of 154%. Stepping back from the quarterly results, our Australia mortgage insurance business has a history of producing strong annual results, and our long-term views of this business and the market fundamentals have not changed. The revenue generation in the business is solid with over $1 billion of unearned premium reserves and a strong investment portfolio producing investment income. In addition, we are in the process of implementing an approximate 7% price increase in the market. While we do expect to see elevated claim levels over the near-term, we have used the current quarter loss emergence and other information to strengthen loss reserves, we believe, sufficient to cover these elevated claims. However, reserve adequacy will be dependent on future economic and housing market conditions, and the results for the next 2 quarters will be key test for these reserves. We do expect to produce an annual profit for 2012, but our quarterly results will be volatile with more noted improvements in the second half of the year.
Moving to Slide 14. As you can see, our capital level remains strong. Our estimated regulatory capital ratio at the first quarter is 153%. The 153% level is consistent with the ratios we reported throughout 2011. Over the past 18 to 24 months, in addition to building hard capital, we have significantly diversified the capital profile in Australia by raising $140 million of local Tier 2 debt and have significantly expanded our external reinsurance program, both in coverage levels and a number of participating reinsurers. As the in-force portfolio continues to season and as profits are generated going forward, we expect the Australian business to continue its strong generation of capital. Related to our planned dividend for the year, we expect the business to generate capital level sufficient to make the payment. However, this payment will be contingent on results for the year, approval by the Australia board and discussions with our regulator. The Australia dividend is less than 50% of the total international MI dividend for the year.
Turning to Slide 15. We know there have been views expressed about a housing bubble in Australia by certain parties, while others support the ongoing strength of the housing market. On this slide, we highlight the views of both bears and bulls as well as our own. Our views are: first, lending standards in Australia have remained strong with household formation driving housing demand. On a national level, there is a shortage of housing. The outlook for the economy remains solid, although we do expect continued areas of subregional pressure such as the coastal areas of Queensland. While home prices are high by historical measures, they have been supported by increased consumer purchasing power with home prices moderating since the second quarter of 2010. And while household indebtedness has increased, exposing consumers to rate shocks, the ratio of debt to disposable income has been relatively steady for several years at 150%. The majority of this debt is mortgage-related, which can be repaid over a long period of time.
In summary, we expect national home prices to be flat for 2012, allowing further digestion of historical home price increases. In closing, we are disappointed with the quarterly performance, but our approach has been to make adjustments to put this issue behind us. Importantly, we must leverage the experience to improve our processes going forward. Within all of this, our long-term view of the Australia mortgage insurance business has not changed. The business and market fundamentals remain in place and are strong.
Now, let me open the call up for Q&A."

With respect to your Australia question around profitability in the second half, I would just say -- I'll break this down into 3 buckets and that is our current delinquency inventory, and the mix that we've seen come through, the loss emergence in March that we saw and the approach that we took to record our reserve strengthening of $82 million to put the issue behind us with respect to what we see in the delinquency portfolio. So we've used our best information to book that $82 million, again, to put it behind us but facts and circumstances could come through in the second and third quarter. That could call into question, that reserve adequacy, and we want to see 2 to 3 quarters come through to prove that out. Number two, the pressured segments that we're seeing, the '07 and the '08 both in Coastal Queensland and Queensland in general, we see stabilizing trends there. But again, we want to see the proof points come through in the second and third quarter. And again, as -- in my prepared remarks, we took underwriting actions particularly related to some of the pressure points we saw in '07 and '08. And you've seen the recent vintages and the new vintage performance has improved as a result of that. So we'll be profitable for the year based on our best estimates. Right now, we're going to be very volatile. In a quarter-by-quarter basis, I can't make the call but really, we want to see the next 2 to 3 quarters and the proof come through on our reserve adjustment of $82 million and the vintage, the '07 and '08, and Coastal Queensland come through. We're seeing stability, but we want to see that come through."

I'd start out by observing that the performance we saw in the first quarter was certainly in line with our plans -- I think it's in line with what we talked about on our February call. Since we don't have any current plans to contribute capital to USMI based on what we're seeing. I'd also kind of stepping back, observe that we're certainly encouraged by seeing private equity money begin to flow into the space. They obviously have pretty high standards of returns, and I think that confirms our view around the value of new business that's being written. So we're -- it's very interesting to see that quite frankly. When you think about capital, as we've talked in the past and you've heard Kevin talked about it at some links, it's really not a bright line in the sand on -- risk-to-capital is obviously 1 metric. It's easy for investors to look at, but regulators look much deeper than that, claim stability, solvency reserve levels -- and we think right now, with the waivers we've got in GEMICO in 44 states along with the GRMAC which has got capital to write across 50 states, we think we're in pretty good shape. But, Kevin, why don’t you speak to our performance a bit that we saw in the quarter?"

In the first quarter, the metrics that we've laid out for investors in our February call were operating in line with all of those metrics. In fact, a little bit favorable when you get down and look at -- but internally, in terms of what our expectations were from an overall surplus standpoint, our penetration in the market is going up. Our NIW is basically in line with our expectations. Our reserves and our delinquency development are -- the experience we're seeing there are totally in line with the reserve provisioning we did in the past. Our loss mitigation trends are in line or, in fact, a little bit ahead of our overall expectation going forward. And we think that's been sort of a nice outcome for us. The new delinquencies, which we said we are expecting, would be down about 20% year-over-year. First quarter, they're down a little more than that in the 23-ish level. So the charts that we put up on USMI illustrate all of those trends that I just showed. And again, we're very comfortable at this point in time that we don't have any to put anything in. We're working closely with our regulators and the GSEs on that. And if things change, we'll let you know. But at the current time, we don't see a need for it."

I guess the way that I look at this is that we reported an income of $5 million for the quarter. Marty had indicated that there were several items, taxes, restructuring cost and one other item that are not expected to impact the business going forward. So when you adjust for that, the earnings -- if you look at it, it's about $15 million for the quarter, which is clearly down from the $19 million in the fourth quarter and about $25 million in the first quarter of last year. And that is primarily due to the loss ratio. And what I'd say is that there are several markets or several countries that are, I'll say, performing worse than the recent trends from an unemployment perspective and from an economy growth perspective. And that's what impacted our results. I'd look at it as a smaller version of what we saw in 2009 with the general downturn in Europe. And there, what we needed to do was step back, look at our contracts and look at our ability to reprice and take measures to improve the profitability of the business going forward. While this is a lesser impact clearly than what we saw a couple of years ago, we would take the same approach and expect to improve the underwriting results over a 3- to 4-quarter timeframe."

Today, I will provide an overview of the business and capital results in the first quarter. But first, I want to acknowledge and thank Mike Fraizer for his contributions to the company over the years. From his early days at GE, through the IPO in 2004 and the recent financial crisis. Under Mike's tenure as CEO, he has nurtured a commitment for making a difference for the people who rely on us most: our customers, policyholders, employees, communities and industry. This has helped set a strong foundation to build from. Genworth has established a strong competitive positions in our leadership lines, loyal customers and distributors and a very talented and dedicated group of employees across the company. With this transition, we will be very focused on executing the actions needed to rebuild value for shareholders as well as bondholders. We will continue to meet the needs of our customers while we improve the performance of our businesses, maintain strong liquidity and generate and manage capital. I look forward to working with the board and with our team to manage this transition.
Now turning to results. The first quarter saw good progress in U.S. Life Insurance and U.S. Mortgage Insurance, stable performance in Canada as well as our investment portfolio, but very disappointing results on Australia, which resulted in delaying the timing of our planned minority IPO. Unfortunately, it overshadows the progress we've made in other areas.
I'll begin with the Global Mortgage Insurance division, where the reported loss in the quarter was $36 million compared with net operating income of $16 million from the prior year. Let me give some perspectives on each of the mortgage platforms. In Australia, the operating loss was $21 million. The results reflected a $53 million after-tax impact from the reserve strengthening in Australia. This is driven by the combination of accelerated processing of delinquencies in our pipeline from 2011 through foreclosure to claim along with higher current and anticipated severity that we identified as we went deeper in individual claim cases during March and updated estimates for property price declines in certain submarkets, particularly in Queensland.
The delinquencies we are dealing with are concentrated from geographic vintage year and borrower profile standpoints. They are in Queensland in the 2007, 2008 vintages and with small business owners and self-employed borrowers. Jerome will be talking in much more detail about the trends and business results in Australia in just a few minutes.
Before I move on, I'd like to discuss the frustration investors have regarding the Australia MI development. I appreciate your frustration and as part of our leadership transition, we will actively review and seek to improve our processes to avoid such frustration in the future.
Turning now to Canada. Operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, down from $51 million in the prior year. Unemployment is trending lower and home prices are stable sequentially. In the quarter, the business experienced lower earned premiums as the larger 2007 and 2008 books of business continue to season. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 38% as overall delinquencies were down 5% from the prior quarter. I'd like to note that we maintain strong capital positions in both Australia and Canada. The operating loss in other countries in the International Mortgage segment was $9 million from losses driven by the European economic environment, primarily in Ireland.
Moving to U.S. MI. Results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $43 million from a net operating loss of $96 million in the prior quarter and $83 million in the prior year. Flow NIW increased 50% over the prior year as overall private mortgage insurance penetration improved, but it was down 6% sequentially, reflecting competitor pricing pressure on our market share in certain channels. Our estimated market share remains flat in about 14% as we maintain our pricing and underwriting position. We continue to monitor the impact of competitor pricing on our market share. Our total flow delinquencies went down 11% from the prior year with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 through 2008 book. Redefaults on modifications continued as expected. Loss mitigation savings in the quarter increased to $158 million as claims mitigation benefits offset a 5% decline in workouts as HAMP modifications wind down. Our risk-to-capital in GEMICO was relatively stable, up about 25 points to 33.4:1 in the quarter. Genworth Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, or GRMAC, which is a subsidiary of GEMICO, had capital increased modestly to approximately $78 million with the risk-to-capital ratio of 2.4:1, giving it about 1 year of new business capacity across 50 states, depending on the production levels and requiring GSE approval.
Shifting for a minute from quarterly results, I want to discuss some exciting organization moves in our Global MI division. As you know, we efficiently re-segmented our businesses around the need to be served into 3 divisions: Global Mortgage Insurance; Insurance and Wealth Management, led by Pat Kelleher; and Corporate and Runoff.
Now, we're taking the next natural step in our MI businesses to reflect this alignment. So as you saw on separate press release, I'm very pleased to announce that Kevin Schneider will become President and CEO of the Global Mortgage Insurance division, bringing his experience in depth to the entire division. Rohit Gupta, who has had a variety of roles in USMI and most recently served as chief commercial officer of our product, pricing, marketing and sales, will take over as president of USMI.
Let's turn back to results and discuss the Insurance and Wealth Management division with reported operating earnings of $81 million, down from $127 million in the prior year. These results reflect our first life block sale transaction, which generated $170 million of statutory capital benefit and which generated an associated after-tax GAAP net loss of $41 million. Excluding the life block sale transaction, earnings in the quarter were $122 million. Life Insurance earnings were $47 million for the quarter, excluding the life block sale transaction loss, which is up from $42 million in the prior year. Term UL and other universal life sales were flat compared to the fourth quarter. We expect sales to moderate going forward as we make further targeted changes to manage sales mix and volume in order to manage capital.
Finally, we continue to use reinsurance and new business to manage capital effectively. Long-term care earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Overall results were consistent with the prior year with lower mortality, being offset by higher premiums and stable investment yields which were helped in part due to our hedging program. We had 2 reserve items in the quarter. The first item is a $10 million favorable adjustment related to a systems conversion which is taking place in several stages. The second item is the $7 million increase in reserves associated with an improved methodology for incurred but not reported claims that will provide a better estimate of costs and reduced quarterly fluctuations going forward. Additionally, our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older-issued policies has begun to take effect. We still expect the continued impact in 2012 will add about $50 million in additional premium, of which $10 million was reflected in the first quarter and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented. We continue to closely watch the performance of the older business, and we'll assess the need for prudential additional rate increases accordingly.
The block of newer-issued policies had a loss ratio of 52%. Finally, we reinsured about 40% of the new long-term care product to manage capital and risk. Fixed annuities earnings were $23 million as we had a favorable adjustment for the state guarantee fund assessment. Fixed annuity sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter as we continue to manage new business to meet or exceed targeted returns in the low-interest rate environment. International Protection earnings were $5 million, down from both the prior year and prior quarter. The underwriting margin decreased 7 points from both the prior year and prior quarter to 14%. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 7% versus the prior year, but increased 13% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by Southern Europe and when combined with a less favorable claim reserve adjustments drove the loss ratio up 7 points in the quarter to 23%. Total revenue, excluding foreign exchange, was flat versus the prior quarter and down 17% versus the prior year. There were several items in the quarter that we do not expect to impact this business going forward. Higher premium taxes related to a tax court ruling and lower tax benefits impacted the quarter by approximately $7 million in total. Additionally, although operating expenses were down versus the prior quarter, there was a $3 million impact related to restructuring expenses and additional profit share expenses. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, expense actions have been taken to mitigate these impacts. Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter.
Turning to capital, U.S. Life Companies' risk-based capital ratio topped 425%, up 20 points from year-end as we completed the first life block sale transaction. The capital benefit of this transaction was larger than initially estimated due to refined estimates of the associated tax benefits. The unassigned statutory surplus at the end of the first quarter for the U.S. Life Companies is estimated to be $215 million, while the consolidated statutory earnings for the first quarter is estimated to be $280 million, in line with the statutory goals we laid out in our 2012 Business Goals Call in February with quarterly volatility. These goals are a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our Life Companies in 2013, which is  important to our shareholders and our bondholders.
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff division, results improved over the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by better market performance and favorable taxes. Shifting to investments, the Global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were 4.6% in the quarter, which is flat since the prior year and the prior quarter as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships.
We are happy that Dan Sheehan, with 18 years of broad and deep investment experience, has taken the role as our chief investment officer, given Ron Joelson's departure for another position. Over the last several years, Ron worked closely with Dan in our investment team to restructure and de-risk the portfolio. Ron has been a great colleague and friend, and we thank him for his contributions to Genworth.
Turning next to the holding company, we maintained ample liquidity. At the end of the first quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of about $465 million over the prior quarter. This increase reflects approximately $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to tax sharing agreements with our operating companies that we expect to be paid to the operating companies later this year. We executed a $350 million debt offering in March of this year, and continued to navigate towards a long-term leverage ratio between 24% and 26%. After the upcoming June debt maturity, our leverage ratio will be approximately 26%.
I would like to offer some perspectives in how we're thinking about the current cash position of the holding company. When adjusting for the temporary taxes that will be paid later this year and the upcoming $222 million June debt maturity, the holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balance is currently designated for our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, and an additional buffer for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend sources to the holding company over the next 18 months of approximately $350 million.
After the quarter ended, we received approval from Delaware regulators for an extraordinary cash dividend from the U.S. Life Companies of $100 million, which is paid to the holding company in April and is not part of the quarter-end numbers. We also intend to receive approximately $70 million in cash from the sale of GFIS that was completed in early April. In close consultation with the board, we continue to actively evaluate various approaches to rebuild shareholder value, including, for example, share repurchases. With respect to repurchase, we have studied our cash resources and the flows of the holding company and balanced them against our debt service needs and liquidity targets, taking into account the delay in the Australia IPO. The results of this analysis indicate that it is unlikely that we would commence the share repurchase program in 2012.
To conclude, while we have made headway in many of our objectives and seen improved results in some businesses, we have much work ahead. We must continue to manage statutory performance in the Life Companies, navigate the challenges in European economies and their impact on our results, and actively manage and monitor experience in Australia. I look forward to working with the board and with our team of very talented employees to improve performance, generate and manage capital and liquidity and rebuild the value of Genworth.
Let me now turn it over to Jerome to discuss Australia results and trends."

This morning, I will provide insights into our Australia mortgage insurance business and the first quarter trends we observed, where both the number of claims and the average claim payment increased significantly, particularly in March, as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on default management. I will also be discussing the results of the portfolio review that was conducted given the first quarter trends that led to the reserve strengthening. I will conclude with some perspectives on business performance going forward. I will be referring to the Australia MI portfolio update presentation that has been posted to our investor website.
Before I begin, please note the cautionary note with regard to forward-looking statements and the basis for presenting financial information detailed on Slide 1.
As shown on Slide 2, at the end of the first quarter, we had a little over $100 billion of effective risk in-force with an overall portfolio delinquency rate of 0.54%. Our risk in-force is dispersed across 4 major regions, in line with the country's population and across several years of origination or vintages. Overall, our performance has been solid. However, we are seeing pressure in the Queensland region and the 2007 and 2008 vintages. When you drill down 1 level, our business performance is particularly impacted by the Coastal Queensland area and small business and self-employed borrowers in the 2007 and 2008 vintages, with each representing approximately 6% of total risk in-force. I will provide more detail on these subsegments shortly. During late 2008 and through the first half of 2009, we strengthened guidelines and eliminated certain products, which have improved performance of our most recent vintages.
Turning to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we experienced higher losses primarily due to loss reserve strengthening of $82 million before taxes, or $53 million after-tax, which was reviewed by independent third parties. The major drivers of this strengthening were: first, Coastal Queensland economic downturn; two, small business, self-employed borrowers in the '07 and '08 vintages; third, the impact of lender servicing and forbearance programs; and fourth, the number of paid claims and severity.
As you can see on Slide 4, the first key driver of the reserve strengthening was the impact of the Coastal Queensland economic downturn on housing. We have identified these areas as the Far North, Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast, which are principally tourist areas. You will observe the differentiated performance in these areas with peak to trough home price declines in double digits and even deeper declines on some of the foreclosed properties as well as delinquency rates above the rest of Queensland in the overall portfolio. These areas have been hit hard by depressed tourism, particularly as the Australia dollar strengthened, lower levels of consumer and retail spending and reduced housing demand, driving home prices lower. This is indicated on the left of the slide as Queensland tourism has been particularly impacted through early 2011, but is showing early stages of recovery. This early-stage recovery will not impact our delinquencies over the short term but should aid performance over time as economic improvement work its way into the housing market.
Turning to Slide 5. With deeper home price declines and higher average loan balances in Coastal Queensland, when compared to the overall portfolio, our average paid claim on these properties is significantly higher than the overall portfolio. And the number of claims we paid, as well as the average claim, increased significantly on the first quarter of 2012 as we worked with lenders to accelerate claim processing.
As shown on Slide 6, the second driver of the reserve strengthening was a small business of self-employed borrower in the 2007 and 2008 vintages. This segment is more reliant on tourism, retail and consumer spending, including rental income where these borrowers have investment properties. The lower levels of tourism and retail spending have reduced income levels in this segment and, combined with higher cost of living in mortgage payments to the higher interest rates, have created increased claims. On the left side of this page, we have provided details on our small business and self-employed borrower risk in-force and you can see the levels included in the 2007 and 2008 vintages, including Queensland and Coastal Queensland concentrations as well as the higher delinquency rates. The impact of underwriting guideline changes in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 has significantly reduced risk in-force for this segment and improved performance of more recent vintages. As you can see on the right, our average claim paid in the segment tends to be higher than the other portfolio, and we have observed an increase in the number of claims paid in the average claim paid from fourth quarter to first quarter.
Now turning to Slide 7. As we look forward to future claims development, we see delinquency rates for the pressured subsegments, such as the 2007 and '08 vintages and the associated small business and self-employed borrower, are stabilizing, allowing for the normal first quarter seasonal increase. Newer vintages, especially 2010 and 2011, are seasoning very well at this point. In addition, we see an improving profile going forward in the delinquency mix. On the right, we have provided some key metrics that have been produced by the extensive analysis conducted on the delinquency inventory. You will observe that Coastal Queensland accounts for 15% of the delinquent risk in-force in later stage delinquency categories, while reducing to 10% in earlier stage delinquencies. Also, for the 2007 and 2008 small business and self-employed borrowers, we see a corresponding improvement from 25% to 18%. Based on the work completed, we expect severities to decline as we work our way through the later stage delinquencies to the earlier stages. Of course, future claims development will be influenced by economic and housing market conditions as well as lender servicing.
Moving to Slide 8. Another contributing factor was, during late 2011 and into early 2012, we observed an extension of time from initial delinquency to claim payment with 2 key drivers impacting the cycle: lender servicing practices and forbearance programs. The normal cycle from delinquency to claim was on average of approximately 13 to 15 months, which has now been extended given the current circumstances to 18 to 20 months. These delays increased our claims cost. During 2011, as delinquencies increased during the year, certain lender servicing routines fell behind, which created processing delays and caused backlogs to delinquencies. In partnership with key lenders, we increased focus on default management and have seen a portion of these aged delinquencies come through in our first quarter results. In addition, a forbearance process sanctioned by the government has driven delays. This process allows borrowers the opportunity to submit a hardship dispute to an independent third-party to assist in its ultimate resolution. Collections and foreclosure proceedings must cease until a final determination when the hardship is reached. This can further extend the time to claim payment, and we are working with the government to identify areas to improve the process and reduce the cycle time.
In addition, we are actively working on servicing issues with key lenders by placing on-site resources to help accelerate decisions, advise on foreclosure strategies and improve delinquency to claim cycle time.
As shown on Slide 9. In the first quarter of 2012, both the number of claims and the average claim payment, increased significantly as Genworth and key lenders increased focus on default management. As you can see, this was more concentrated in March with a significant increase in the average claim paid as many of these claims also had higher loan balances. The observed increase in average claim size in March led us to conduct a comprehensive review of our delinquency inventory.
Now turning to Slide 10. As a result of loss experience we saw emerge in the first quarter, we felt it necessary and prudent to strengthen loss reserves. Loss reserves are management's best estimate of ultimate paid claims for reported delinquencies including a provision for incurred but not reported losses. In the quarter, we supplemented our normal quarterly actuarial review process with an extensive loan-by-loan analysis of our delinquency inventory. This analysis included obtaining more up-to-date property valuations for all delinquencies with adjustments to further stretch the home price and foreclosure. This analysis form the basis of the reserve strengthening of $82 million. It is important to note that our loss estimates assume no improvement in economic conditions and reserve adequacy may be influenced by perspective changes in economic and housing market conditions. As you can see from the chart, the reserve adjustments were predominantly applied to the late stage delinquencies and loans currently in foreclosure, where we expect higher conversion rates to claim and higher claim severities. The limited strengthening to early stage delinquencies is supported by the changing delinquency mix profile and anticipated improving severity levels. You can think of the reserve strengthening in 2 categories: claims and late stage delinquencies. Approximately $20 million of the reserve strengthening is related to claims to be paid during the second quarter with the residual applied to later stage delinquencies, the majority of which will be paid over the remainder of the year.
Now turning to Slide 11. Going forward, we will continue to thoroughly analyze our delinquency  inventory and update property valuations to assess our loss reserves. In addition, as mentioned earlier, we have on-site default management personnel at key lenders to help improve collections and optimize loss mitigation decisions with an emphasis on loan workout activity, home sale prior to foreclosure or an acceleration to claim. Finally, we will continue to adjust claims payments for cost outside of our Master Policy and carefully monitor performance for small business and self-employed borrowers as well as Coastal Queensland.
Moving to Slide 12. As part of a deeper assessment of our portfolio, we look into other areas that could be sensitive to shifts in tourism similar to Coastal Queensland. The results of this analysis are outlined in the table to the left, highlighting that in other specific tourist areas, we have much lower concentrations and lower delinquency rates. Looking broadly at the vintage analysis on the right side of the slide, we see the underperformance of the 2007 and 2008 vintages with improving trends in more recent vintages. Overall, delinquency trends appear to be stabilizing.
Now turning to Slide 13. The results for the quarter were disappointing with a reported operating loss of $21 million and a loss ratio of 154%. Stepping back from the quarterly results, our Australia mortgage insurance business has a history of producing strong annual results, and our long-term views of this business and the market fundamentals have not changed. The revenue generation in the business is solid with over $1 billion of unearned premium reserves and a strong investment portfolio producing investment income. In addition, we are in the process of implementing an approximate 7% price increase in the market. While we do expect to see elevated claim levels over the near-term, we have used the current quarter loss emergence and other information to strengthen loss reserves, we believe, sufficient to cover these elevated claims. However, reserve adequacy will be dependent on future economic and housing market conditions, and the results for the next 2 quarters will be key test for these reserves. We do expect to produce an annual profit for 2012, but our quarterly results will be volatile with more noted improvements in the second half of the year.
Moving to Slide 14. As you can see, our capital level remains strong. Our estimated regulatory capital ratio at the first quarter is 153%. The 153% level is consistent with the ratios we reported throughout 2011. Over the past 18 to 24 months, in addition to building hard capital, we have significantly diversified the capital profile in Australia by raising $140 million of local Tier 2 debt and have significantly expanded our external reinsurance program, both in coverage levels and the number of participating reinsurers. As the in-force portfolio continues to season and as profits are generated going forward, we expect the Australian business to continue its strong generation of capital. Related to our planned dividend for the year, we expect the business to generate capital level sufficient to make the payment. However, this payment will be contingent on results for the year, approval by the Australia board and discussions with our regulator. The Australia dividend is less than 50% of the total international MI dividend for the year.
Turning to Slide 15. We know there have been views expressed about a housing bubble in Australia by certain parties, while others support the ongoing strength of the housing market. On this slide, we highlight the views of both bears and bulls as well as our own. Our views are: first, lending standards in Australia have remained strong with household formation driving housing demand. On a national level, there is a shortage of housing. The outlook for the economy remains solid, although we do expect continued areas of subregional pressure such as the coastal areas of Queensland. While home prices are high by historical measures, they have been supported by increased consumer purchasing power with home prices moderating since the second quarter of 2010. And while household indebtedness has increased, exposing consumers to rate shocks, the ratio of debt to disposable income has been relatively steady for several years at 150%. The majority of this debt is mortgage-related, which can be repaid over a long period of time.
In summary, we expect national home prices to be flat for 2012, allowing further digestion of historical home price increases. In closing, we are disappointed with the quarterly performance, but our approach has been to make adjustments to put this issue behind us. Importantly, we must leverage the experience to improve our processes going forward. Within all of this, our long-term view of the Australia mortgage insurance business has not changed. The business and market fundamentals remain in place and are strong.
Now, let me open the call up for Q&A."

With respect to your Australia question around profitability in the second half, I would just say -- I break this down into 3 buckets and that is our current delinquency inventory, and the mix that we've seen come through, the loss emergence in March that we saw and the approach that we took to record our reserve strengthening of $82 million to put the issue behind us with respect to what we see in the delinquency portfolio. So we've used our best information to book that $82 million, again, to put it behind us but facts and circumstances could come through in the second and third quarter. That could call into question, that reserve adequacy, and we want to see 2 to 3 quarters come through to prove that out. Number two, the pressured segments that we're seeing, the '07 and the '08 book in Coastal Queensland and Queensland in general, we see stabilizing trends there. But again, we want to see the proof points come through in the second and third quarter. And again, as -- in my prepared remarks, we took underwriting actions particularly related to some of the pressure points we saw in '07 and '08. And you've seen the recent vintages and the new vintage performance has improved as a result of that. So we'll be profitable for the year based on our best estimates. Right now, we're going to be very volatile. In a quarter-by-quarter basis, I can't make the call but really, we want to see the next 2 to 3 quarters and the proof come through on our reserve adjustment of $82 million and the vintage, the '07 and '08, and Coastal Queensland come through. We're seeing stability, but we want to see that come through."

I'd also kind of stepping back, observe that we're certainly encouraged by seeing private equity money begin to flow into the space.

When you think about capital, as we've talked in the past and you've heard Kevin talked about it at some length, there's really not a bright line in the sand on -- risk-to-capital is obviously 1 metric. It's easy for investors to look at, but regulators look much deeper than that, claim stability, solvency reserve levels -- and we think right now, with the waivers we've got in GEMICO in 44 states along with the GRMAC which has got capital to write across 50 states, we think we're in pretty good shape.

Our loss mitigation trends are on line or, in fact, a little bit ahead of our overall expectation going forward. And we think that's been sort of a nice outcome for us. The new delinquencies, which we said we are expecting, would be down about 20% year-over-year. First quarter, they're down a little more than that in the 23-ish level. So the charts that we put up on U.S.MI illustrate all of those trends that I just showed. And again, we're very comfortable at this point in time that we don't have any to put anything in. We're working closely with our regulators and the GSEs on that. And if things change, we'll let you know. But at the current time, we don't see a need for it."

I guess the way that I look at this is that we reported an income of $5 million for the quarter. Marty had indicated that there were several items, taxes, restructuring cost and one other item that are not expected to impact the business going forward. So when you adjust for that, the earnings -- if you look at it, it's about $15 million for the quarter, which is clearly down from the $19 million in the fourth quarter and about $25 million in the first quarter of last year. And that is primarily due to the loss ratio. And what I'd say is that there are several markets or several countries that are, I'll say, performing worse than the recent trends from an unemployment perspective and from an economy growth perspective. And that's what impacted our results. I'd look at it as a smaller version of what we saw in 2009 with the general downturn in Europe. And there, what we needed to do was step back, look at our contracts and look at our ability to reprice and take measures to improve the profitability of the business going forward. While this is a lesser impact clearly than what we saw a couple of years ago, we would take the same approach and expect to improve the underwriting results over a 3- to 4-quarter timeframe."

Today, we'll comment on second quarter results, give an update on our situation, provide some detail on long-term theory reserving and highlight recent product and REIT actions. First, I think it's important to discuss strategic review of our management team has taken in conjunction with our board. As a backdrop, our current share price in simply unacceptable. We understand the concerns of investors and bondholders, we launched our comprehensive strategic review to develop specific plans that were addressed this concerns and set a course for turnaround in rebuilding our financial strength, flexibility and performance.
We want to give our constituents as much clarity as possible about our directions. The review of the strategy is complete, we are moving ahead to implement near-term action plans and our far along in the development of longer-term steps.
This morning, I want to frame the objectives, issues and constraints we are addressing to provide you better insights into our process. As I know you understand in order to optimize your ability to execute and to avoid creating undue market expectations and distractions, we will not discuss specific conceptions until the appropriate times.
We are focused on 3 primarily issues consistent with the feedback from our investors and bondholders. First, operating business performance was improved significantly. Quite simply, many of our businesses have been generating relatively low returns on their capital and result must improve regardless of strategy. Second, financial flexibility should be increased to execute our strategic plans. And finally, we need to address the complexity of our business portfolio so it would be simpler for investors to understand and more attractive for them to invest their capital.
To address these issues, we have the following objectives in our review. We identified businesses which are strategic for most which are better characterized as financial investments. In this regard, we have considered several factors including: The competitive landscape and business environment for each business, including assessments of where we have clear advantages; the ability of the business to generate returns in excess of its specific cost of capital; the ability to alter the product's design, underwriting characteristics or pricing; the potential of the business to generate capital for strategic flexibility; and finally, the expected timing for achievement of specific business goals. Prior to this review, we had not distinguished between strategic businesses and businesses which should be effectively viewed and managed through financial investments. For businesses that are strategic, we are developing plans for them to improve performance and be financially sound. To be successful, businesses will need to deliver operating results that will support our full infrastructure costs, generate cash that covers their share of debt service, and produce returns about the specific cost of capital. This will provide the discipline and focus for this businesses to stand on their own. This discipline reduces their reliance on other businesses or on the holding company. This, in turn, should improve financial results and create both strategic and financial flexibility.
In the past, our actual price and manage to support overall leverage target in cost of capital did not reflect our profit risk profile of the particular product. And cash generation was not specific our consistent objectives. In addition, some functional lower head cost was not always fully allocated or covered by product pricing margins. This interdependency and across products hurt the performance of the businesses and financial flexibility of the holding company.
Businesses which are financial investments will be used to generate capital and provide strategic flexibility through, for example, their ultimate sale. We will now such actions appropriate times for the reasons that I noted before. As we determine appropriate actions, we'll move quickly as possible to execute them, certain constraint will require sequential execution on some actions over time. Such constraints include the following factors: First, major business segments such as U.S. Life Insurance and USMI are not currently able to pay regular ordinary dividends to the holding company. This constrictions place a major part in repositioning the finish portfolio, as well as allocating and managing capital. A second constraint is there current that float. Where we believe that operating leverage between 24% to 26% as a profit for our current diversified business mix, the average really to be meaningfully reduced for age business to be able to support its own capital and that flowed. For example, we believe will perform in mortgage insurance platforms should internally maintain leverage and 12% 18% range. Life insurance platforms made 22% to 25%. For each of the respective divisions to a profit that look for specific business mix, average and adequate for the company would be dropped 18% to 20% or declines of approximately $1.5 billion in overall debt, excluding cash flow and coverage requirement would require further that reductions. Another obvious consideration is the need to work constructively with regulators in order to execute our product, capital and dividend plans. Like other insurers, we will not act unilaterally. And finally, we need to keep our promises to our customers and our bondholders by saying appropriate claims, servicing our debts and meeting the commitments that we have made.
As we develop and execute our action plans, I want to be clear that the Board, the management team and our employees understand our challenges, our opportunities and the urgency needed as we take action. We provide valuable products and services to our customers and remain in competitive positions in many of the markets we serve. We want to build on those strengths but recognize we must also rebuild value for shareholders.
We have a committed task force of employees working on a daily basis in conjunction with advisers and members of our senior management team. This group has been regularly discussing with our board of directions and actions that should be taken. All of this recognize that the status quo is unacceptable and results need to be demonstrated properly. 
As we move forward, it's important for investors to understand of the initiatives we've discussed earlier this year are important steps in achieving the plan. In particular, returning regular ordinary dividend capacity to our U.S. Life Insurance companies in 2013 remains a critical objective. We continue to manage our business to optimize that results to realize this goal. Executing the partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal and reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk, as well as generating capital. While the delay in the IPO earlier this year was very disappointing, we remain committed to this partial sale as soon as possible for the target of early next year.
And finally, managing dividends to the holding company while maintaining a proper capital levels and the businesses remains an important objective.
Let me turn now to one important outcome of our review, a series of major steps we are taking to improve the performance of our long-term care business. A few months ago, we began a detailed review of the business including pricing and profitability, reserving and risk factors. The long-term care business at lower terms and equity in aggregate. Losses in the block of older issued policies dragged down return significantly. However, I'll review demonstrated issued policies although profitable, was performing up to their pricing standards. Finally, while their new business has returned in the mid-teens, we also observed that it's risk profile has an associated cost of capital which is relatively high and could be lowered. The results of this review led us to make several important decisions, consistent with objectives and considerations I laid out earlier. First, we will implement significant, additional rate increases on a block of older issued policies to help manage the losses on those policies. Second, we will take early intervention on the newer issued policies which were performing below pricing requirements to attempt to restore pricing margins to our rate increases. And finally, we intend to further derisk the product to lower its specific cost of capital so these returns are better able to cover those costs and increase value to shareholders.
Long-term care products are important customer needs and the demand will only grow. However, these products need to provide value not only for customers, but also for shareholders. We are positioning Genworth to meet customer needs and terms which are attractive not only for them but for shareholders as well. Pat Kelleher will discuss these actions and changes in more detail shortly. 
Finally, I'd like to note that development of our strategic direction and plans is not dependent on, nor are waiting for, the naming of a permanent  CEO. While the Board has been working with the management team to determine our direction, it has also retained Russell Reynolds to assist in the CEO search. 
As I now transition from strategy to ratings, I'd note that the direction provided from the strategic review is an integral step towards enhancing the holding company's financial strength and flexibility and improving its long-term ratings profile.
With that said, let me provide an update and some perspectives regarding Moody's recent announcement of their review of the holding company for possible downgrades. While being split rate is certainly will be manageable, is obviously not what we want and we take our ratings and the review very seriously. This announcement came despite the progress we have made in respect of the specific factors highlighted in Moody's March affirmation of our companies ratings which can lead to a downgrade. While the strategic actions we're taking and planning should build financial strength in the future, we of course must deal with where we are now. In light of the Moody's review and investor increase, let me note that simply delinking U.S. Mortgage Insurance may not necessarily be the most cost-effective or most beneficial option for investors or bondholders. Depending on how a delinking is executed, we could have its own potential negative implications the holding company ratings. To elaborate, in light of our current plans to not contribute capital to this business, we have been evaluating options to address Moody's concerns. These options include amending the bond debentures, putting the business into runoff or spinning off the business, and detracting outside capital for the business. Along with ratings, key considerations for options include minimizing capital required over short and medium-term, maintaining liquidity and protecting value, reputation, ratings and regulatory relationships in other businesses; and ultimately, maximizing medium to long-term shareholder value. Let me now comment on some of these options.
While amendment of our bond is possible, the cost of gaining sufficient approvals from bondholders could be significant. We continue to review this option, but seeking such approvals may not be a solution to observe the ratings. In our view, the management sponsor the regulatory approval runoff will not trigger an event of the provision or bond and credit agreements. However, placing the business from runoff does not delink us from the legacy books, and we do not believe this is the solution to preserve the rating.
In conjunction with our advisors, we have also evaluated the potential spinoff for sale. These options will have the benefit of truly rolling off U.S. exposures from the company. These options may not be viable at this time due to potential capital required to execute the transaction. However, we are continuing to consider potential solutions and we'll provide updates as appropriate.
Before I discuss the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we received approval for the extension of the North Carolina waiver for an 18-month period through July 31, 2014. This extension should enable us to continue writing the business consistent with our current plan. 
Now let's turn to second quarter results beginning with the Global Mortgage Insurance. We saw good progress in the division with reported net operating income of $51 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, significantly better results in Australia for a reserve strengthening in the first quarter, and continuing improvement in U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $44 million versus a loss of $21 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment was stable and home prices were down slightly with some continued regional variation. The loss ratio for the quarter was 54%. Overall, delinquencies were done with new delinquencies flat and improving across the portfolio. Paid claims remained elevated compared to 2011. The prior quarter reserve strengthening held up and is in line with the trends we are anticipating around an increase in paid claims. The segments which drove the reserve strengthening in the first quarter, 2007 and 2008 book years, small business or self-employed borrowers and coast of Queensland are still pressured with delinquency ratio stable.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $41 million for the quarter, up from $37 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment decreased modestly and home prices were stable sequentially. The loss ratio decreased 6 points sequentially to 32%, as overall delinquencies were down 8% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues. Our capital positions in Australia and in Canada remain sound.
The operating loss in other countries in the international mortgage segment was flat sequentially at $9 million, driven by the stressed European economic environment, primarily in Ireland. 
Moving now to U.S. MI, results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $25 million from a net operating loss of $43 million in the prior quarter. A decrease in new delinquency development, modest changes in aging of existing delinquencies and the effect of loss mitigation programs are partially offset by lower activity particularly in south cures. During the quarter we terminated and external reinsurance contract that benefited our results were $12 million. Our total flow delinquencies fell by 15% from the prior year with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the continued burn-through to 2005 to 2008 books, and in line of our expectation that we laid out in February.
Our risk to capital in GEMICO was relatively stable, up about 0.9 points to 34.31 in the quarter. In General Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation or GRMAC, which is a subsidiary of GEMICO, capital increased modestly to about $80 million with the risk to capital ratio of about 3.3:1. 
With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to rate new businesses, risk to capital ratio is above 25:1 in GEMICO.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management division, results were down with disappointing earnings in long-term care and in international production. Reported operating earnings were $79 million, down from $138 million in the prior year, $91 million in the prior quarter or $121 million with adjusted for that quarter Life block sales transaction.
Life Insurance earnings were $30 million for the quarter. We saw higher mortality in the quarter, although still in line with pricing. Overall sales were up $4 million versus the prior quarter, and $3 million versus the prior year. In the quarter, we suspended sales about 15-year and the 30-year universal life products as we manage sales volume and improved performance. We expect that these products suspensions will materially decrease sales in the second half of this year. 
Long-term care earnings were down for the quarter at $14 million. Higher severity and lower claim terminations for fewer recoveries and lower mortality drove the reported loss ratio up 8 points over the prior quarter and 4 points over the prior year. Our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older issued policies continue to take effect. We still expect about $50 million in the additional premium in 2012, of which $11 million is reflected in the second quarter and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented.
As I mentioned before, we are taking significant remedial steps in this business. 
Next to annuity earnings were $20 million and sales in the plan where flat to the first quarter as we continue to maintain strength. International Protection earnings were $3 million, down from both the prior year and the prior quarter, driven by both lower premiums and a tough consumer lending environment, and relatively worse performance in products with lower profit-sharing. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 8% versus the prior quarter and we're flat to the prior year. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, we continue to take expense actions to mitigate these impacts. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and the prior year after adjusting for GFIS which was sold in the beginning of April, and which accounted for approximately $2 million earnings in the prior quarter and the prior year.
Margins as a percent of assets under management increased 7% from prior year. And in July, we announced an expanded investment platform to respond in the market environment and investor needs.
Turning now to capital. The U.S. Life Companies risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 405%, down from the first quarter due to 3 main factors: First, the extraordinary $100 million dividend paid in the holding company for the Medicare supplement sale; second, pressured annuity results given lower equity markets and declining interest rates; and third, the unfavorable impact from the timing of unauthorized reinsurance. 
In July, we filed for approval of additional collateral to address the impact of unauthorized reinsurance, retroactive to June 30. This improved the RBC ratio by 10 points and netted about $90 million to our unassigned surplus which is estimated to be approximately $40 million. We still expect to achieve a 2012 earnings in surplus and statutory earnings targets that we laid out in February. We will manage statutory performance through lower sales and long-term care, hedging of the variable annuity business to better protect statutory capital from equity market moves, and additional life block transactions. These goals are a high-priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our Life Companies next year. 
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff division, results in the runoff segment were lower from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results driven by unfavorable market conditions and lower tax benefits. 
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio is performing well.  we're up slightly during the quarter to 4.7% as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships.
Turning next to the holding company, we continue to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the cash and liquid securities balance at the end of the quarter still reflects about $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to tax during agreement with our operating companies that we expect to pay to the operating company later this year.
After adjusting for those temporary tax benefits, the holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balance is currently designated for our target of 2x debt service coverage which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividends sources of the holding company over the next 18 months. 
As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was approximately 25%, which is in line with our long-term leverage target.
I'd like to now provide an update on our dividend goals for the year. Insurance and Wealth Management is on track and has paid $120 million to the end of the quarter with an interim dividend of $45 million to be paid in August to the holding company. This represents $165 million, over half of our $300 million goals for the year and the division. 
Regarding Global Mortgage Insurance, a challenging global economic environment and the concerned by us and the regulators of the potential contingent risk if the economic conditions worsen, is impacting views on the level of capital ruled above our renewed their minimum requirements. We now expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012, as compared to our earlier target of $160 million. We will continue to manage capital and performance, look to execute additional reinsurance treaties and monitor market conditions. We do still expect to maintain a buffer to holding company of $350 million over our 2x debt service target throughout the rest of this year.
Given the interest in long-term care and the part of the many investors and analysts, I thought it will be useful to provide a brief overview of our reserving process. First, let me break out my actuarial hat and give some background for those who aren't actuaries or accountants. We hold 2 main types of reserves: Active life reserves and disabled life reserves. Active life reserves represent the access of the present value of expected future benefits over the present value of the portion of premiums determinated issue required to fund expected benefits. The difference between the policy premium and this valuation premium funds both expected profits and expenses. The assumptions underlying this reserve is slightly different for GAAP and statutory reporting rules, but are generally a combination of best estimate and prescribed of respectively. Disabled life reserves are held for policies on claims and established using best estimates for factors such as morbidity, mortality, recovery and continuums. Disabled life reserves are released as claims are paid or an event the claimant dies. We recently completed a comprehensive claims analysis which covers 160,000 long-term care claims dating all the way back to 1976. Our analysis tracks claim development by age, gender and underwriting generation, which are all a key factors in determining claims cost. The analysis include in the valuation of all components of the claims life cycle, including length to claim, utilization of contractually available benefits, and the transition of claimants from one state of care to add  another, such as when the move from home care to a nursing home. We gained several  useful insights on trends of performance of our in-force business as a result of this study. In addition, this evaluation gives us an updated view into the performance of policies for lifetime benefits versus those without them. We will integrate experience from this analysis into our claim reserving methodology in the third quarter, and expect only a minor impact on total claim reserve levels. This analysis is also instructive with respect to the future product pricing and design.
Finally, reserve adequacy is reviewed at least annually on both the GAAP and statutory serving basis, not only by management, but also by several independent third parties. The Board's audit committee receives and reviews report on reserves as well. Cash is based on recent experience to mild input from a third-party reviews, lead us to believe that given what we know today, current reserves in aggregate are adequate at this time. We will continue to closely monitor, emerging experience and trends.
Let me wrap up. I'm very excited about our plans and the upside that we have at Genworth. We are moving forward to build our financial strength and our strategic flexibility for our shareholders. At the same time, the mixed operating results this quarter illustrates and confirmed the importance of the change that we're making to improve business performance.
With the dedicated and talented employees, we are leaning hard into work ahead to turn Genworth around. 
Now, let me turn it over to Pat to dig a bit deeper into the long-term care and Life businesses."
8598029,212592471,336358,"Genworth Financial Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Genworth Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our Life Insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes. in the Life Insurance b",1593,"Thanks, Marty. Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our Life Insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes. 
in the Life Insurance business, term life insurance mortality is a key earnings driver. Focusing on the past 10 quarters, we've seen favorable actual expected mortality levels compared with our pricing assumptions. Those levels have been 93% for all of 2010, 90% for all of 2011, with quarterly variation between 83% to 96%, and most recently, 98% and 100% in the first 2 quarters of 2012. As a result, our second quarter earnings in the Life Insurance business were lower from increased term life insurance mortality experience when compared to the prior year. Although historical mortality experience is generally favorable to pricing, the second quarter results demonstrate that after 3 consecutive quarters of relatively low levels of mortality, we've now had 2 consecutive quarters at higher levels. Our analysis indicate that this experience is normal volatility in the range that can be expected and consistent with pricing.
Next I'll provide a short update regarding the NIC recently exposed actuarial guideline 38 proposal to change the statutory valuation for universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. Separate rules are being proposed for new and for enforced business. The proposed effective date for addressing any impact on in-force reserves is December 31, 2012, while the proposed effective date for new business is January 1, 2013. Our new business, out the expected outcome associated with proposed changes will be material increases the statutory serves over time. Not unlike the changes previously made to the traditional term product valuations in 1999, we realize that any such changes to AG38 will require that all companies, including Genworth, review and potentially revise product offerings, pricing and utilization of reinsurance about rebalancing the value proposition for consumers and for shareholders.
We've already begun this work and anticipate changes in our product portfolio with new product solutions, expected to be in place by this new revelations being effective in the word.
Now turning to our long-term care business. Current quarter financial results were lower sequentially, primarily reflecting lower team termination and higher claim severities. Claim terminations are comprised of mortality, claim recovery and benefit exhaustion components. For exhaustion tends to be more stable, the impact of mortality and claim recoveries be more volatile from quarter-to-quarter. In the past few quarters, we have seen this quarterly variations contribute to variability and results. As an example, a 0.5% change in the quarterly claim termination rates can impact earnings in a single quarter by approximately $9 million. On an annual basis, our claim termination rates have shown more stability.
Looking past the quarterly results, we have spent considerable time over the past few months focused on the composition of our long-term care portfolio and the performance of various segments of this portfolio overtime. I will share key aspects of our analysis to provide context for both our revised strategy and approach for re-rating the in-force business, and for the new business pricing and product changes we are implementing. We posted on our website a document to provide additional information on our portfolio. 
Going to Slide 3, this slide gives some perspective on differences between our old generation and new generation products. As you can see, our approach to pricing and underwriting criteria has evolved over time. We have monitored our extensive claims experience and made adjustments to our product offerings to enhance our risk and return profile by updating the underlying morbidity, lapse and interest rate pricing assumptions, as their product offerings were introduced. Our all generation blocks of business were marketed through roughly 2003 and have historically produced GAAP basis loss ratio around 90% to 104% annually over the last 4 years, with some quarter variation.
This compares to the price or life ratio of 60% to 65%. Our new generation blocks of business generally have been performing much better as a result of these changes, and have generated returns in the mid-teens with annual loss ratios of approximately 50% in aggregate over the last 4 years, again with some quarterly variations. This compares with price for lifetime ratio of 60% to 65%. We would anticipate that the loss ratio on these blocks will increase moderately overtime as the blocks age. 
On Slide 4, we provide profiles of the product that comprise our all generation and new generation blocks of business. From our most recent comprehensive claims analysis, we have observed that product design has also played an important role in the development and performance of these blocks. While the all generation blocks experienced significant losses, primarily due to price lapse assumptions much higher than the actual lapse experience, it should also be noted that policies rep like the benefits are projected to perform worse than policies with non-lifetime benefits. Over time, we have seen a decrease in the percentage of policies issued with lifetime benefits, from the pricing actions taken to reduce the percentage of business sold with this benefit structure.
Moving to Slide 5. With this in mind, I would like to discuss a change in our strategy and approach to re-rating in-force business, and our plans to implement further rate increases beginning over the next several quarters, focusing first on the performance of our older issued policies.  In 2007 and 2010, we initiated premium rate increases of approximately 10% and 18%, respectively, on the majority of our older series of policies. Later this month, we will begin filing a new round of premium rate increases with several goals in mind. On the older issued policies that have been rated before, we intend to achieve average premium increases in excess of 50% over the next 5 years. Previously, we had asked for more frequent, lower increases, but we will pursue fewer and larger increases going forward. We will work with individual states to determine the timing of these increases and give policyholders transparency into the plans of the company over time.
Similar to the premium rate increases on our all generation block, we will be seeking approvals for premium rate increases for the majority of policyholders in the earliest series of our new generation policies. This block of policies has generated positive operating earnings, but is falling short of the original price for returns due to lower interest rates, higher claims due to unfavorable business mix, and lower lapse rates than expected. I should note that we had used a 2% ultimate lapse rate in pricing this product series. We want to stay ahead of this block of business with our in-force premium rating strategy, and we'll therefore request an average premium rate increase in excess of 25% over the next 5 years. We believe that early intervention on the newer block is important to managing the long-term performance of this business.  Subject to regulatory approvals, we anticipate this premium rate increases in total will generate approximately $200 million to $300 million of additional annual premium when fully implemented. For new business, on July 30, we implemented several changes to our current privilege choice flex products, which accounts for approximately 70% of our new sales, to increase margins and reduce risks. In order to mitigate morbidity and investment risk, we suspended sales of policies with unlimited benefits. In response to the low-interest rate environment, we also suspended sales of limited pay contracts. The current products had been priced with a 4.5% investment yield assumption, and the current rate environment presents heightened risk for limited pay contracts. In addition, we announced price increases through the reduction of our couples discount and the elimination of our preferred health discount.  These changes effectively raise premium levels by approximately 20%. Finally, we further tightened our underwriting requirements, including the requirement to obtain family history during underwriting, and new underwriting criteria which result in classifying applicants with a family history of schizophrenia as uninsurable. 
Shifting to Slide 6 in our new business strategy. The product changes we just covered were made as an interim step to introducing a new product series in the first half of 2013. The 2013 product which will replace privilege choice lacks will include certain cost formative context that have been long accepted life insurance pricing and underwriting but which are new to long-term care. Specifically,  we will begin requiring blood and lab underwriting requirements to better assess certain health conditions such as diabetes, that can impact the morbidity of an applicant in the future years. Also, the pricing will include premium rates that will be differentiated based on gender to reflect the different claims experience of male and female policyholders. In addition to these changes, the new product will have updated pricing, including an investment yield assumption more in line with today's environment. Finally, we will no longer provide lifetime benefits.  The filing process for these new products is well underway with approvals from several states already received. 
We are committed to improving the financial performance of our long-term care portfolio, and revising our new business product offerings to create a favorable risk reward profile I'll effectively addressing marketplace needs. We've embarked on a major strategic shift in our approach to in-force management, shifting from our previous incremental rate increase philosophy to a more aggressive and focused strategy of multiyear rate increases to improve our risk and return profile in the old generation block, and to get ahead of any issues in the performance of the newer generation block.
Now I will open it up for questions."

We do want to not only increase performance but want to increase our financial flexibility, and so as we work in developing our strategic businesses, we're going to hopefully be improving significantly overtime their earnings profile and frequent on a risk-adjusted basis. But we also as we think managing financial investment, companies that we are businesses that we do financial investment, we'll be managing them and using them as a way to generate capital. As we generate capital, I'd say this different things we can do and I'll assess that at the appropriate time. Certainly, delivering is now possibility and gives us more flexibility than split things to make sense that, that plan can go down at have a bit more. But obviously, share repurchase is something that has been on the mind of investors and we'll look at that. And also we want to make sure the balance sheets and businesses are strong and strategic business are able to perform. So these are all things that will be thinking about as we generate capital and will assess how to use the proceeds at that point in time, we'll obviously be thinking about what will advance that but we'll make that final call as we get closer. I would say, over time, we do expect to probably bring down leverage a bit, but we'll talk about more specific plans about that down the road."

I do think we will continue to look at opportunities for additional external reinsurance opportunities. If you think about Marty's earlier comments around improving business performance and have individual business lines and platforms, we were able to stand on our own and have less reliance on other affiliates around the holding company, this is very consistent with that strategy. We want to continue to reduce affiliate reinsurance coverage. And we also want to continue to support the development of a stable and active mortgage insurance reinsurance markets, which is something we've had considerable benefit from throughout the first half of this year as we've added other external reinsurance.

Today, we'll comment on second quarter results, give an update on our rating situation, provide some detail on long-term care reserving and highlight recent product and rate actions. But first, I think it's important to discuss the strategic review our management team has taken in conjunction with our board. As a backdrop, our current share price and bond spreads are simply unacceptable. We understand the concerns of investors and bondholders. We launched our comprehensive strategic review to develop specific plans that would address this concerns and set a course for turning around Genworth and rebuilding our financial strength, flexibility and performance.  We want to give our constituents as much clarity as possible about our direction. The review of the strategy is complete. We are moving ahead to implement near-term action plans and our far along in the development of longer-term steps.
This morning, I want to frame the objectives, issues and constraints we are addressing to provide you better insights into our process. As I know you understand in order to optimize our ability to execute and to avoid creating undue market expectations and distractions, we will not discuss specific transactions until the appropriate times.  We are focused on 3 primarily issues consistent with the feedback from our investors and bondholders. First, operating business performance must improved significantly. Quite simply, many of our businesses have been generating relatively low returns on their capital and results must improve regardless of strategy. Second, financial flexibility should be increased to execute our strategic plans. And finally, we need to address the complexity of our business portfolio, so it is simpler for investors to understand and more attractive for them to invest their capital.
To address these issues, we have the following objectives in our review. We identified businesses which are strategic from those which are better characterized as financial investments. In this regard, we have considered several factors including the competitive landscape and business environment for each business, including assessments of where we have clear advantages, the ability of the business to generate returns in excess of its specific cost of capital, the ability to alter a product's design, underwriting characteristics or pricing, the potential of the business to generate capital for strategic flexibility and finally, the expected timing for achievement of specific business goals. Prior to this review, we had not distinguished between strategic businesses and businesses which should be effectively viewed and managed as financial investments. For businesses that are strategic, we are developing plans for them to improve performance and be financially sound. To be successful, businesses will need to deliver operating results that will support their full infrastructure costs, generate cash that covers their share of debt service, and produce returns above our specific cost of capital. This will provide the discipline and focus for this businesses to stand on their own. This discipline reduces their reliance on other businesses or on the holding company. This, in turn, should improve financial results and create both strategic and financial flexibility.
In the past, products were priced and managed to support overall leverage targets in cost of capital which did not reflect  their profit risk profile of the particular product, and cash generation was not a specific or consistent objective. In addition, some function on overhead costs were not always fully allocated or covered by product pricing margins. This interdependency and subsidization across products hurt the performance of the businesses and financial flexibility of the holding company.
Businesses, which are financial investments, will be used to generate capital and provide strategic flexibility through, for example, their ultimate sale. We will announce such actions at the appropriate times for the reasons that I noted before. As we've determine appropriate actions, we'll move quickly as possible to execute them. Certain constraints will require sequential execution on some actions over time. Such constraints include the following factors: First, major business segments such as U.S. Life Insurance and USMI are not currently able to pay regular ordinary dividends to the holding company. This consideration plays a major part in repositioning our business portfolio, as well as in allocating and managing capital. A second constraint is our current debt load. While we believe that operating leverage between 24% and 26% is a appropriate for our current diversified business mix, leverage average would need to be really to be meaningfully reduced for each business to be able to support its own capital and debt load. For example, we believe well-performing mortgage insurance platforms should generally can maintain leverage in the 12% 18% range. Life insurance platforms should generally maintain between 22% to 25%. For each of the respective divisions to carry an appropriate debt load for its specific business mix, leverage in aggregate for the company would need to drop to about 18% to 20% or decline of approximately $1.5 billion in overall debt, excluding cash flow and coverage requirement would require further debt reduction. Another obvious consideration is the need to work constructively with regulators in order to execute our product, capital and dividend plans. Like other insurers, we will not act unilaterally. And finally, we need to keep our promises to our customers and to our bondholders by obtaining appropriate claims, servicing our debt and meeting the commitments that we have made.
As we develop and execute our action plans, I want to be clear that the board, the management team and our employees understand our challenges, our opportunities and the urgency needed as we take action. We provide valuable products and services to our customers and remain in competitive positions in many of the markets we serve. We want to build on those strengths, but recognize we must also rebuild value for shareholders.  We have a committed task force of employees working on a daily basis in conjunction with the outside advisers and members of our senior management team. This group has been regularly discussing with our board the directions and actions that should be taken. All of us recognize that the status quo is unacceptable and results need to be demonstrated promptly. 
As we move forward, it's important for our investors to understand that the initiatives we've discussed earlier this year are important steps in achieving the plan. In particular, returning regular ordinary dividend capacity to our U.S. Life Insurance companies in 2013 remains a critical objective. We continue to manage our business to optimize statutory results to realize this goal. Executing the partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk, as well as generating capital. While the delay in the IPO earlier this year was very disappointing, we remain committed to this partial sale as soon as possible for the target of early next year.  And finally, managing dividends to the holding company, while maintaining appropriate capital levels in the businesses, remains an important objective.
Let me turn now to one important outcome of our review, a series of major steps we are taking to improve the performance of our long-term care business. A few months ago, we began a detailed review of the business, including pricing and profitability, reserving and risk factors. The long-term care business has had lower turns on equity in aggregate. Losses in the block of older issued policies dragged down return significantly. However, our review also demonstrated that not all of the block of newer issued policies, although profitable, was performing up to their pricing standards. Finally, while our new business has returns in the mid-teens, we also observed that its risk profile had an associated cost of capital, which was relatively high and could be lowered. The results of this review led us to make several important decisions consistent with the objectives and considerations I laid out earlier. First, we will implement significant, additional rate increases in our block of older issued policies to help manage the losses on those policies. Second, we will take early intervention on the newer issued policies, which are performing below pricing requirements, to attempt to restore pricing margins through rate increases. And finally, we intend to further de-risk the product to lower its specific cost of capital, so that these returns are better able to cover those costs and increase value to shareholders.
Long-term care products serve an important customer need and the demand will only grow. However, these products need to provide value not only for customers, but also for shareholders. We are positioning Genworth to meet customer needs and terms, which are attractive not only for them, but for our shareholders as well. Pat Kelleher will discuss these actions and changes in more detail shortly. 
Finally, I'd like to note that development of our strategic direction and plans is not dependent on nor waiting for the naming of a permanent  CEO. While the board has been working with the management team to determine our direction, it has also retained Russell Reynolds to assist in the CEO search. As I now transition from strategy to ratings, I'd note that the direction provided from the strategic review is an integral step towards enhancing the holding company's financial strength and flexibility and improving its long-term ratings profile.
With that said, let me provide an update and some perspectives regarding Moody's recent announcement of their review of the holding company for possible downgrade. While being split rate certainly would be manageable, it is obviously not what we want and we take our ratings and the review very seriously. This announcement came despite the progress we have made with respect to the specific factors highlighted in Moody's March affirmation of our company's ratings which could lead to a downgrade. While the strategic actions we are taking and planning should build financial strength in the future, we of course must deal with where we are now. In light of the Moody's review and investor inquiries, let me note that simply de-linking U.S. Mortgage Insurance may not necessarily be the most cost-effective or most beneficial option for investors or bondholders. Depending on how a de-linking is executed, it could have its own potential negative implications to holding company ratings. To elaborate, in light of our current plans to not contribute capital to this business, we have been evaluating options to address Moody's concerns. These options include amending the bond indentures, putting the business into runoff or spinning off the business and detracting outside capital for the business. Along with ratings, key considerations for options include minimizing capital required over the short and medium-term, maintaining liquidity and protecting value, reputation, ratings and regulatory relationships in other businesses and ultimately, maximizing medium to long-term shareholder value. 
Let me now comment on some of these options.  While amendment of our bond indentures is possible, the cost of gaining sufficient approvals from bondholders could be significant. We continue to review this option, but seeking such approvals may not be a solution to preserve the rating. In our view, management's response are that regulatory approved runoff would not trigger in the event of the fall provisions to our bond indentures and credit agreements. However, placing the business in runoff does not de-link us from the legacy books and we do not believe this is the solution to preserve the rating.  In conjunction with our advisors, we have also evaluated a potential spinoff for sale. These options would have the benefit of truly rolling off U.S. MI exposures from the company. These options may not be viable at this time due to potential capital required to execute the transaction. However, we are continuing to consider potential solutions and we'll provide updates as appropriate.
Before I discuss the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we received approval for the extension of the North Carolina waiver for an 18-month period through July 31, 2014. This extension should enable us to continue writing new business consistent with our current plan. 
Now let's turn to second quarter results beginning with the Global Mortgage Insurance. We saw good progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $51 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, significantly better results in Australia for our reserve strengthening in the first quarter, and continuing improvement in U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $44 million versus a loss of $21 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment was stable and home prices were down slightly with some continued regional variations. The loss ratio for the quarter was 54%. Overall, delinquencies were done with new delinquencies flat and cure is improving across the portfolio. Paid claims remained elevated compared to 2011. The prior quarter reserve strengthening held up and is in line with the trends we were anticipating around an increase in paid claims. The segments which drove the reserve strengthening in the first quarter, 2007 and 2008 book years, small business or self-employed borrowers and coast of Queensland borrowers, are still pressured with delinquency ratio stable.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $41 million for the quarter, up from $37 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment decreased modestly and home prices were stable sequentially. The loss ratio decreased 6 points sequentially to 32%, as overall delinquencies were down 8% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues. Our capital positions in Australia and in Canada remains sound.  The operating loss in other countries in the international mortgage segment was flat sequentially at $9 million, driven by the stressed European economic environment, primarily in Ireland.  
Moving now to U.S. MI, results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $25 million from a net operating loss of $43 million in the prior quarter. A decrease in new delinquency development, modest changes in aging of existing delinquencies and the effect of loss mitigation programs were are partially offset by lower cure activity particularly in self-cures. During the quarter, we terminated an external reinsurance contract that benefited our results by $12 million. Our total flow delinquencies fell by 15% from the prior year with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the continued burn-through to 2005 to 2008 books and in line with our expectations that we laid out in February.  
Our risk-to-capital in GMICO was relatively stable, up about 0.9 points to 34.3:1 in the quarter. In General Residential Mortgage Assurance Corporation or GRMAC, which is a subsidiary of GMICO, capital increased modestly to about $80 million with a risk-to-capital ratio of about 3.3:1. With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk-to-capital ratios above 25:1 in GMICO.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management division, results were down with disappointing earnings in long-term care and in international production. Reported operating earnings were $79 million, down from $138 million in the prior year and $81 million in the prior quarter or $121 million when adjusted for that quarter's life block sales transaction.  Life Insurance earnings were $30 million for the quarter. We saw higher mortality in the quarter, although still in line with pricing. Overall sales were up $4 million versus the prior quarter and $3 million versus the prior year. In the quarter, we suspended sales of both the 15-year and the 30-year term universal life product, as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect that these products suspensions will materially decrease sales in the second half of this year. 
Long-term care earnings were down for the quarter at $14 million. Higher severity and lower claim terminations from few recoveries and lower mortality drove the reported loss ratio up 8 points over the prior quarter and 4 points over the prior year. Our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older issued policies continued to take effect. We still expect about $50 million in additional premium in 2012, of which $11 million was reflected in the second quarter and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented.  As I mentioned before, we are taking significant remedial steps in this business. Fixed annuity earnings were $20 million and sales in this line where flat to the first quarter as we continue to maintain spread. International Protection earnings were $3 million, down from both the prior year and the prior quarter, driven by both lower premiums and a tough consumer lending environment and relatively worse performance in products with lower profit sharing. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 8% versus the prior quarter and were flat to the prior year. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, we continue to take expense actions to mitigate these impacts. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and the prior year after adjusting for GFIS, which was sold at the beginning of April, and which accounted for approximately $2 million earnings in the prior quarter and the prior year.  Margins as a percent of assets under management increased 7% from the prior year and in July, we announced an expanded investment platform to respond to the market environment and investor needs.
Turning now to capital. The U.S. Life Companies risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 405%, down from the first quarter due to 3 main factors: first, the extraordinary $100 million dividend paid at the holding company in April from a Medicare supplement sale; second, pressured variable annuity results given lower equity markets and declining interest rates; and third, the unfavorable impact from the timing of unauthorized reinsurance. In July, we filed for approval of additional collateral to address the impact of unauthorized reinsurance, retroactive to June 30. This improved the RBC ratio by 10 points and netted about $90 million to our unassigned surplus, which is estimated to be approximately $40 million. We still expect to achieve the 2012 earnings in surplus and statutory earnings targets that we laid out in February. We will manage statutory performance through lower sales in life and long-term care, hedging of the variable annuity business to better protect statutory capital from equity market moves and additional life block transactions. These goals are a high-priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our Life Companies next year. Finally, in the corporate and runoff division, results in the runoff segment were lower from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results driven by unfavorable market conditions and lower tax benefits. Shifting to investments, the global portfolio is performing well.  Core yields were up slightly during the quarter to 4.7% as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships.
Turning next to the holding company, we continue to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the cash and liquid securities balance at the end of the quarter still reflects about $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to tax sharing agreements with our operating companies that we expect to pay to the operating companies later this year.  After adjusting for those temporary tax benefits, the holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balance is currently designated for our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividends sources of the holding company over the next 18 months. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was approximately 25%, which is in line with our long-term leverage target.
I'd like to now provide an update on our dividend goals for the year. Insurance and Wealth Management is on track and has paid $120 million through the end of the quarter with an interim dividend of $45 million approved to be paid in August to the holding company. This represents $165 million, over half of our $300 million goal for the year in the division. Regarding Global Mortgage Insurance, a challenging global economic environment and the concern by us and our the regulators of the potential contagion risk if economic conditions worsen, is impacting views on the level of capital hold above our regulatory minimum requirements. We now expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012 as compared to our earlier target of $160 million. We will continue to manage capital and performance, look to execute additional reinsurance treaties and monitor market conditions. We do still expect to maintain a buffer at the holding company of $350 million over our 2x debt service target throughout the rest of this year.
Given the interest in long-term care on the part of the many investors and analysts, I thought it would be useful to provide a brief overview of our reserving process. First, let me break out my actuarial hat and give some background for those who aren't actuaries or accountants. We hold 2 main types of reserves: active life reserves and disabled life reserves. Active life reserves represent the excess of the present value of expected future benefits over the present value of the portion of premiums determined to issue required to fund expected benefits. The difference between the policy premium and this valuation premium funds both expected profits and expenses. The assumptions underlying these reserves are slightly different for GAAP and statutory reporting rules, but are generally a combination of best estimate and prescribe conservatism respectively. Disabled life reserves are held for policies on claims and are established using best estimates for factors such as morbidity, mortality, recovery and continuums. Disabled life reserves are released as claims are paid or in the event the claimant dies. We recently completed a comprehensive claims analysis which covered 160,000 long-term care claims dating all the way back to 1976. Our analysis track claim development by age, gender and underwriting generation, which were all a key factors in determining claims costs. The analysis includes in the evaluation of all components of the claims life cycle, including length of claim, utilization of contractually available benefits and the transition of claimants from one state of care to add  another, such as when they move from home care to a nursing home. We gained several  useful insights on trends of performance of our in-force business as a result of this study. In addition, this evaluation give us an updated view into the performance of policies for lifetime benefits versus those without them. We will integrate experience from this analysis into our claim reserving methodology in the third quarter and expect only a minor impact on total claim reserve levels. This analysis is also constructed with respect to future product pricing and design.
Finally, reserve adequacy is reviewed at least annually on both a GAAP and statutory serving basis, not only by management, but also by several independent third parties. The board's audit committee receives and reviews reports on reserves as well. Cash is based on recent experience to mild input from third-party reviews, lead us to believe that given what we know today, current reserves in aggregate are adequate at this time. We will continue to closely monitor emerging experience and trends.
Let me wrap up. I'm very excited about our plans and the upside that we have at Genworth. We are moving forward to build our financial strength and our strategic flexibility for our shareholders. At the same time, the mixed operating results this quarter illustrate and confirm the importance of the change that we're making to improve business performance.  With our dedicated and talented employees, we are leaning hard into the work ahead to turn Genworth around. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat to dig a bit deeper into the long-term care and Life businesses."

Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our life insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes.  In our life insurance bu",1600,"Thanks, Marty. Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our life insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes.  In our life insurance business, term life insurance mortality is a key earnings driver. Focusing on the past 10 quarters, we've seen favorable actual to expected mortality levels compared with our pricing assumptions. Those levels have been 93% for all of 2010, 90% for all of 2011, with quarterly variation between 83% to 96% and most recently, 98% and 100% in the first 2 quarters of 2012. As a result, our second quarter earnings in the Life Insurance business were lower from increased term life insurance mortality experience when compared to the prior year. Although historical mortality experience is generally favorable to pricing, the second quarter results demonstrate that after 3 consecutive quarters of relatively low levels of mortality, we've now had 2 consecutive quarters at higher levels. Our analysis indicate that this experience is normal volatility in the range that can be expected and consistent with pricing.
Next I'll provide a short update regarding the NAIC's recently exposed actuarial guideline 38 proposals to change the statutory valuation for universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. Separate rules are being proposed for new and for enforced business. The proposed effective date for addressing any impact on in-force reserves is December 31, 2012, while the proposed effective date for new business is January 1, 2013. For new business, the expected outcome associated with proposed changes will be material increases to statutory reserves over time. Not unlike the changes previously made to the traditional term product valuations in 1999, we realize that any such changes to AG 38 will require that all companies, including Genworth, review and potentially revise product offerings, pricing and utilization of reinsurance while rebalancing the value proposition for consumers and for shareholders.  We've already begun this work and anticipate changes in our product portfolio with new product solutions expected to be in place as these new revelations become effective in the market.
Now turning to our long-term care business. Current quarter financial results were lower sequentially, primarily reflecting lower claim termination and higher claim severity. Claim terminations are comprised of mortality, claim recovery and benefit exhaustion components. While exhaustion tends to be more stable, the impact of mortality and claim recoveries can be more volatile from quarter-to-quarter. In the past few quarters, we have seen this quarterly variations contribute to variability in results. As an example, a 0.5% change in the quarterly claim termination rate can impact earnings in a single quarter by approximately $9 million. On an annual basis, our claim termination rates have shown more stability.
Looking past the quarterly results, we've spent considerable time over the past few months focused on the composition of our long-term care portfolio and the performance of various segments of this portfolio overtime. I will share key aspects of our analysis to provide context for both our revised strategy and approach for re-rating the in-force business and for the new business pricing and product changes we are implementing. We posted on our website a document to provide additional information on our portfolio. 
Going to Slide 3. This slide gives some perspective on differences between our old generation and new generation products. As you can see, our approach to pricing and underwriting criteria has evolved over time. We have monitored our extensive claims experience and made adjustments to our product offerings to enhance our risk and return profile by updating the underlying morbidity lapse and interest rate pricing assumptions as new product offerings were introduced. Our old generation blocks of business were marketed through roughly 2003 and have historically produced GAAP basis loss ratio around 90% to 104% annually over the last 4 years, with some quarterly variation.  This compares to the price for lifetime loss ratio of 60% to 65%. Our new generation blocks of business generally have been performing much better as a result of these changes and have generated returns in the mid-teens with annual loss ratios of approximately 50% in aggregate over the last 4 years, again, with some quarterly variations. This compares with price for our lifetime loss ratios of 60% to 65%. We would anticipate that the loss ratios on these blocks would increase moderately overtime as the blocks age. 
On Slide 4, we provide profiles of the product series that comprise our old generation and new generation blocks of business. From our most recent comprehensive claims analysis, we have observed that product design has also played an important role in the development and performance of these blocks. While the old generation blocks experienced significant losses primarily due to price for lapse assumptions much higher than the actual lapse experienced. It should also be noted that policies with lifetime benefits are projected to perform worse than policies with non-lifetime benefits. Over time, we have seen a decrease in the percentage of policies issued with lifetime benefits from the pricing actions we've taken to reduce the percentage of business sold with this benefit structure.
Moving to Slide 5. With this in mind, I would like to discuss a change in our strategy and approach to re-rating in-force business and our plans to implement further rate increases beginning over the next several quarters, focusing first on the performance of our older issued policies.  In 2007 and 2010, we initiated premium rate increases of approximately 10% and 18% respectively on the majority of our older series of policies. Later this month, we will begin filing a new round of premium rate increases with several goals in mind. On the older issued policies that have been rated before, we intend to achieve average premium increases in excess of 50% over the next 5 years. Previously, we had asked for more frequent, lower increases, but we will pursue fewer and larger increases going forward. We will work with individual states to determine the timing of these increases and give policyholders transparency into the plans of the company over time.
Similar to the premium rate increases on our old generation block, we will be seeking approval for premium rate increases for the majority of policyholders in the earliest series of our new generation policies. This block of policies has generated positive operating earnings, but is falling short of the original price for our returns due to lower interest rates, higher claims due to an unfavorable business mix and lower lapse rates than expected. I should note that we had used a 2% ultimate lapse rate in pricing this product series. We want to stay ahead of this block of business with our in-force premium rating strategy, and we'll therefore request an average premium rate increase in excess of 25% over the next 5 years. We believe that early intervention on the newer block is important to managing the long-term performance of this business.  Subject to regulatory approvals, we anticipate this premium rate increases in total will generate approximately $200 million to $300 million of additional annual premium when fully implemented. 
For new business, on July 30, we implemented several changes to our current Privileged Choice Flex products, which accounts for approximately 70% of our new sales to increase margins and reduce risks. In order to mitigate morbidity in investment risks, we suspended sales of policies with unlimited benefits. In response to the low-interest rate environment, we also suspended sales of limited pay contracts. The current product had been priced with a 4.5% investment yield assumption and the current rate environment presents heightened risk for limited pay contracts. In addition, we announced price increases through the reduction of our couples discount and the elimination of our Preferred Health Discount.  These changes effectively raise premium levels by approximately 20%. Finally, we further tightened our underwriting requirements, including the requirement to obtain family history during underwriting and new underwriting criteria, which result in classifying applicants with a family history of schizophrenia as uninsurable. 
Shifting to Slide 6 in our new business strategy. The product changes we just covered were made as an interim step to introducing a new product series in the first half of 2013. The 2013 product which will replace Privileged Choice Flex will include certain transformative concepts that have been long accepted in life insurance pricing and underwriting, but which are new to long-term care. Specifically,  we will begin requiring blood and lab underwriting requirements to better assess certain health conditions such as diabetes that can impact the morbidity of an applicant in future years. Also, the pricing will include premium rates that will be differentiated based on gender to reflect the different claims experience of male and female policyholders. In addition to these changes, the new product will have updated pricing, including an investment yield assumption more in line with today's environment. Finally, we will no longer provide lifetime benefits.  The filing process for these new product is well underway with approvals from several states already received. 
We are committed to improving the financial performance of our long-term care portfolio and revising our new business product offerings to create a favorable risk reward profile while effectively addressing marketplace needs. We've embarked on a major strategic shift in our approach to in-force management, shifting from our previous incremental rate increase philosophy to a more aggressive and focused strategy of multiyear rate increases to improve our risk and return profile in the old generation block and to get ahead of any issues in the performance of the newer generation block.  Now I will open it up for questions."

This is Marty. Thanks for your question. As we think about -- that we wanted to kind of point out just so everybody kind of has a common understanding of kind of leverage and kind of talk about it because in aggregate, we certainly felt it's appropriate for the mix of businesses we have. But as certain investors think about separation or other business actions we might take, we wanted to point out that leverage targets are obviously  different for different types of businesses. So part of it was really due to educate folks. We do want to not only increase and improve our business performance, but we want to increase our financial flexibility. And so as we work in developing our strategic businesses, we're going to hopefully be improving significantly overtime their earnings profile frequently on a risk-adjusted basis. But we also, as we think of managing financial investments, companies that we -- or businesses, I should say, that we do these financial investments, we'll be managing them and using them as a way to generate capital. As we generate capital, I'd say there's different things we could do and we'll assess that at the appropriate time. Certainly, delevering is one possibility and that would give us more flexibility. And if a split seem to make sense at that point in time, it's -- we could go down that path a bit more. But obviously, share repurchase is something that has been on the mind of investors and we'll look at that. And also, we want to make sure that our balance sheets in our businesses are strong and our strategic businesses are able to perform. So those are all things that we'll be thinking about as we generate capital and we'll assess how to use the proceeds at that point in time. We'll obviously be thinking about it well in advance to that, but we'll make that final call as we get closer. I would say, over time, we do expect to probably bring down leverage a bit, but we'll talk about more specific plans about that down the road."

They continue to watch how our performance expectations and our financial results have tracked against our estimates and really this goes back to the end of second quarter last year. So I think they've been watching our profitability and the development. They've been watching our new business development and they've been doing and working with their own set of tools and stress test around what could be some downside risk in all this. So it's third-party work, it's our work, it's their work if you sort of triangulate it all together  and I think they've got a pretty clinical assessment of what's going on with our financials. And very importantly, they also continue to see the decrease in new delinquencies going forward that we pointed to in February, as we said, which has really been a key driver of our loss performance in the first half of the year. So the problem with NIW, I think,  is a big thing, but we really feel good about the -- I think it's a strong example of the working relationship we've built with the regulator over time. By being transparent, they see everything that the GSE see, that our auditors see and that we see and when you bake that all in together, we came to an outcome that we're very pleased with."

They generate capital through both their stat earnings and as well as the seasoning of those larger blocks of business and we'll continue to. The reason we made some adjustment on this quarter to our expectation and to provide a lower range frankly than we had hoped for was you got a lot of other things going on in this market. Both we and our regulators are looking at what's going on with sort of the global capital markets. There's concern with European contagion to some of these markets or broader global contagion. And so as we work and talk with our regulators, we thought it was prudent at this point to ratchet that back a little bit and to provide that range of $50 million to $110 million. I would not say it's largely driven by the reduction of that affiliate reinsurance, not at all. And we're going to continue to work on, as I said, other capital plans such as some additional things around reinsurance to continue to try and improve that outcome and hit the -- and land it in a higher range on that, but we thought it's important to put that out in front of our investors at this point."

When went through the first quarter, I think we shared with our investors that we were going to see those larger claims come through. And as you think about your claim inventory, they have high-frequency factors relative to your overall delinquency inventory, which has a mix to it of younger delinquencies, some of the later-stage delinquencies and some of the foreclosures or mortgages in possession. So as you think about that, you got to think about your mix and you got to also evaluate the fact that in the second quarter, we actually saw our delinquency aging improve a little bit. So as we had those later-stage arrears move through to claim, our delinquency mix shifted a little bit towards the earlier stage delinquencies. What I would do is take you all the way back to the fact that as we paid claims in the second quarter, our reserve provisioning held up very, very well. There was very, very tight alignment there and you're going to see -- we're going to continue to see those larger claims come through in the third and fourth quarter. We want to see that reserve adequacy carry through and hold up. Remember, we've done a delinquency by delinquency inventory and established those reserves, but we feel good about where we are and need to do see the third and the  fourth quarter play out on reserves."

Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. We advise you to read the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each filed with the SEC.  This morning's discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be meaningful to investors. In our financial supplement and earnings release, non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP where required, in accordance with SEC rules. And, finally, when we talk about International Protection and International Mortgage Insurance results, please note that all percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And now, let me turn the call over to Marty Klein."

We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so our prepared remarks will run about 45 minutes and we may run a bit past 10:00 a.m. to allow time for questions. Today, we'll comment on second quarter results, give an update on our rating situation, provide some detail on long-term care reserving and highlight recent product and rate actions. But first, I think it's important to discuss the strategic review our management team has taken in conjunction with our board. As a backdrop, our current share price and bond spreads are simply unacceptable. We understand the concerns of investors and bondholders. We launched our comprehensive strategic review to develop specific plans that would address these concerns and set a course for turning around Genworth and rebuilding our financial strength, flexibility and performance.  We want to give our constituents as much clarity as possible about our direction. The review of the strategy is complete. We are moving ahead to implement near-term action plans and our far along in the development of longer-term steps.
This morning, I want to frame the objectives, issues and constraints we are addressing to provide you better insights into our process. As I know you understand in order to optimize our ability to execute and to avoid creating undue market expectations and distractions, we will not discuss specific transactions until the appropriate times.  We are focused on 3 primary issues consistent with the feedback from our investors and bondholders: First, operating business performance must improved significantly. Quite simply, many of our businesses have been generating relatively low returns on their capital and results must improve regardless of strategy. Second, financial flexibility should be increased to execute our strategic plans. And finally, we need to address the complexity of our business portfolio, so it is simpler for investors to understand and more attractive for them to invest their capital.
To address these issues, we have the following objectives in our review. We identified businesses which are strategic from those which are better characterized as financial investments. In this regard, we have considered several factors including the competitive landscape and business environment for each business, including assessments of where we have clear advantages, the ability of the business to generate returns in excess of its specific cost of capital, the ability to alter a product's design, underwriting characteristics or pricing, the potential of the business to generate capital for strategic flexibility and finally, the expected timing for achievement of specific business goals. Prior to this review, we had not distinguished between strategic businesses and businesses which should be effectively viewed and managed as financial investments. For businesses that are strategic, we are developing plans for them to improve performance and be financially sound. To be successful, businesses will need to deliver operating results that will support their full infrastructure costs, generate cash that covers their share of debt service, and produce returns above their specific cost of capital. This will provide the discipline and focus for this businesses to stand on their own. This discipline reduces their reliance on other businesses or on the holding company. This, in turn, should improve financial results and create both strategic and financial flexibility.
In the past, products were priced and managed to support overall leverage targets in cost of capital which did not reflect their profit risk profile of the particular product, and cash generation was not a specific or consistent objective. In addition, some function on overhead costs were not always fully allocated or covered by product pricing margins. This interdependency and subsidization across products hurt the performance of the businesses and financial flexibility of the holding company.
Businesses which are financial investments will be used to generate capital and provide strategic flexibility through, for example, their ultimate sale. We will announce such actions at the appropriate times for the reasons that I noted before. As we've determine appropriate actions, we'll move quickly as possible to execute them. Certain constraints will require sequential execution on some actions over time. Such constraints include the following factors: First, major business segments such as U.S. Life Insurance and USMI are not currently able to pay regular ordinary dividends to the holding company. This consideration plays a major part in repositioning our business portfolio, as well as in allocating and managing capital. A second constraint is our current debt load. While we believe that operating leverage between 24% and 26% is appropriate for our current diversified business mix, leverage would need to be meaningfully reduced for each business to be able to support its own capital and debt load. For example, we believe well-performing mortgage insurance platforms should generally can maintain leverage in the 12% to 18% range. Life insurance platforms generally maintain leverage between 22% to 25%. For each of the respective divisions to carry an appropriate debt load for its specific business mix, leverage in aggregate for the company would need to drop to about 18% to 20% or a decline of approximately $1.5 billion in overall debt, excluding cash flow and coverage requirement would require further debt reduction. Another obvious consideration is the need to work constructively with regulators in order to execute our product, capital and dividend plans. Like other insurers, we will not act unilaterally. And finally, we need to keep our promises to our customers and to our bondholders by obtaining appropriate claims, servicing our debt and meeting the commitments that we have made.
As we develop and execute our action plans, I want to be clear that the board, the management team and our employees understand our challenges, our opportunities and the urgency needed as we take action. We provide valuable products and services to our customers and remain [ph] in competitive positions in many of the markets we serve. We want to build on those strengths, but recognize we must also rebuild value for shareholders.  We have a committed task force of employees working on a daily basis in conjunction with the outside advisers and members of our senior management team. This group has been regularly discussing with our board directions and actions that should be taken. All of us recognize that the status quo is unacceptable and results need to be demonstrated promptly. 
As we move forward, it's important for our investors to understand that the initiatives we've discussed earlier this year are important steps in achieving the plan. In particular, returning regular ordinary dividend capacity to our U.S. Life Insurance companies in 2013 remains a critical objective. We continue to manage our business to optimize statutory results to realize this goal. Executing the partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk, as well as generating capital. While the delay in the IPO earlier this year was very disappointing, we remain committed to this partial sale as soon as possible with a target of early next year.  And finally, managing dividends to the holding company, while maintaining appropriate capital levels in the businesses, remains an important objective.
Let me turn now to one important outcome of our review, a series of major steps we are taking to improve the performance of our long-term care business. A few months ago, we began a detailed review of the business, including pricing and profitability, reserving and risk factors. The long-term care business has had low returns on equity in aggregate. Losses in the block of older issued policies dragged down return significantly. However, our review also demonstrated that not all of the block of newer issued policies, although profitable, was performing up to their pricing standards. Finally, while our new business has returns in the mid-teens, we also observed that its risk profile had an associated cost of capital, which was relatively high and could be lowered. The results of this review led us to make several important decisions consistent with the objectives and considerations I laid out earlier. First, we will implement significant, additional rate increases in our block of older issued policies to help manage the losses on those policies. Second, we will take early intervention on the newer issued policies, which are performing below pricing requirements, to attempt to restore pricing margins through rate increases. And finally, we intend to further de-risk the product to lower its specific cost of capital, so that these returns are better able to cover those costs and increase value to shareholders.
Long-term care products serve an important customer need and the demand will only grow. However, these products need to provide value not only for customers, but also for shareholders. We are positioning Genworth to meet customer needs on terms which are attractive not only for them but for our shareholders as well. Pat Kelleher will discuss these actions and changes in more detail shortly. 
Finally, I'd like to note that development of our strategic direction and plans is not dependent on nor waiting for the naming of a permanent CEO. While the board has been working with the management team to determine our direction, it has also retained Russell Reynolds to assist in the CEO search. As I now transition from strategy to ratings, I'd note that the direction provided from the strategic review is an integral step towards enhancing the holding company's financial strength and flexibility and improving its long-term ratings profile.
With that said, let me provide an update and some perspectives regarding Moody's recent announcement of their review of the holding company for possible downgrade. While being split rate certainly would be manageable, it is obviously not what we want and we take our ratings and the review very seriously. This announcement came despite the progress we have made with respect to the specific factors highlighted in Moody's March affirmation of our company's ratings which could lead to a downgrade. While the strategic actions we are taking and planning should build financial strength in the future, we of course must deal with where we are now. In light of the Moody's review and investor inquiries, let me note that simply de-linking U.S. Mortgage Insurance may not necessarily be the most cost-effective or most beneficial option for investors or bondholders. Depending on how a de-linking is executed, it could have its own potential negative implications to holding company ratings. To elaborate, in light of our current plans to not contribute capital to this business, we have been evaluating options to address Moody's concerns. These options include amending the bond indentures, putting the business into runoff or spinning off the business and attracting outside capital for the business. Along with ratings, key considerations for options include minimizing capital required over the short and medium-term, maintaining liquidity and protecting value, reputation, ratings and regulatory relationships in other businesses and ultimately, maximizing medium- to long-term shareholder value. 
Let me now comment on some of these options.  While amendment of our bond indentures is possible, the cost of gaining sufficient approvals from bondholders could be significant. We continue to review this option, but seeking such approvals may not be a solution to preserve the rating. In our view, a management-sponsored regulatory approved runoff would not trigger in the event of the fall provisions to our bond indentures and credit agreements. However, placing the business in runoff does not de-link us from the legacy books and we do not believe this is the solution to preserve the rating.  In conjunction with our advisors, we have also evaluated a potential spinoff for sale. These options would have the benefit of truly rolling off U.S. MI exposures from the company. These options may not be viable at this time due to potential capital required to execute the transaction. However, we are continuing to consider potential solutions and we'll provide updates as appropriate.
Before I discuss the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we received approval for the extension of the North Carolina waiver for an 18-month period through July 31, 2014. This extension should enable us to continue writing new business consistent with our current plan. 
Now let's turn to second quarter results beginning with Global Mortgage Insurance. We saw good progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $51 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, significantly better results in Australia after our reserve strengthening in the first quarter, and continuing improvement in U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $44 million versus a loss of $21 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment was stable and home prices were down slightly with some continued regional variations. The loss ratio for the quarter was 54%. Overall, delinquencies were down with new delinquencies flat and cure is improving across the portfolio. Paid claims remained elevated compared to 2011. The prior quarter reserve strengthening held up and is in line with the trends we were anticipating around an increase in paid claims. The segments which drove the reserve strengthening in the first quarter, 2007 and 2008 book years, small business or self-employed borrowers and coast of Queensland borrowers, are still pressured but delinquency ratio stable.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $41 million for the quarter, up from $37 million in the prior quarter. Unemployment decreased modestly and home prices were stable sequentially. The loss ratio decreased 6 points sequentially to 32%, as overall delinquencies were down 8% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues. Our capital positions in Australia and in Canada remain sound.  The operating loss in other countries in the international mortgage segment was flat sequentially at $9 million, driven by the stressed European economic environment, primarily in Ireland.  
Moving now to U.S. MI, results improved in the quarter to a net operating loss of $25 million from a net operating loss of $43 million in the prior quarter. A decrease in new delinquency development, modest changes in aging of existing delinquencies and  effect of loss mitigation programs were partially offset by lower cure activity particularly in self-cures. During the quarter, we terminated an external reinsurance contract that benefited our results by $12 million. Our total flow delinquencies fell by 15% from the prior year with new delinquencies down both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the continued burn-through to 2005 to 2008 books and in line with our expectations that we laid out in February.  
Our risk-to-capital in GMICO was relatively stable, up about 0.9 points to 34.3:1 in the quarter. In General Residential Mortgage Assurance Corporation or GRMAC, which is a subsidiary of GMICO, capital increased modestly to about $80 million with a risk-to-capital ratio of about 3.3:1. With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk-to-capital ratios above 25:1 in GMICO.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management division, results were down with disappointing earnings in long-term care and in international production. Reported operating earnings were $79 million, down from $138 million in the prior year and $81 million in the prior quarter or $121 million when adjusted for that quarter's life block sales transaction.  Life Insurance earnings were $30 million for the quarter. We saw higher mortality in the quarter, although still in line with pricing. Overall sales were up $4 million versus the prior quarter and $3 million versus the prior year. In the quarter, we suspended sales of both the 15-year and the 30-year term universal life product, as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect that these products suspensions will materially decrease sales in the second half of this year. 
Long-term care earnings were down for the quarter at $14 million. Higher severity and lower claim terminations from fewer recoveries and lower mortality drove the reported loss ratio up 8 points over the prior quarter and 4 points over the prior year. Our previously announced premium rate increase on the majority of the older issued policies continued to take effect. We still expect about $50 million in additional premium in 2012, of which $11 million was reflected in the second quarter and about $60 million in 2013 when fully implemented.  As I mentioned before, we are taking significant remedial steps in this business. Fixed annuity earnings were $20 million and sales in this line where flat to the first quarter as we continue to maintain spread. International Protection earnings were $3 million, down from both the prior year and the prior quarter, driven by both lower premiums and a tough consumer lending environment and relatively worse performance in products with lower profit sharing. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 8% versus the prior quarter and were flat to the prior year. In light of the continued slow consumer lending environment in Europe, we continue to take expense actions to mitigate these impacts. 
Wealth Management earnings were $12 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and the prior year after adjusting for GFIS, which was sold at the beginning of April, and which accounted for approximately $2 million earnings in the prior quarter and the prior year.  Margins as a percent of assets under management increased 7% from the prior year and in July, we announced an expanded investment platform to respond to the market environment and investor needs.
Turning now to capital. The U.S. Life Companies risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 405%, down from the first quarter due to 3 main factors: first, the extraordinary $100 million dividend paid to the holding company in April from a Medicare supplement sale; second, pressured variable annuity results given lower equity markets and declining interest rates; and third, the unfavorable impact from the timing of unauthorized reinsurance. In July, we filed for approval of additional collateral to address the impact of unauthorized reinsurance, retroactive to June 30. This improved the RBC ratio by 10 points and netted about $90 million to our unassigned surplus, which is estimated to be approximately $40 million. We still expect to achieve the 2012 earnings in surplus and statutory earnings targets that we laid out in February. We will manage statutory performance through lower sales in life and long-term care, hedging of the variable annuity business to better protect statutory capital from equity market moves and additional life block transactions. These goals are a high-priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our Life Companies next year. Finally, in the corporate and runoff division, results in the runoff segment were lower from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results driven by unfavorable market conditions and lower tax benefits. Shifting to investments, the global portfolio is performing well. Core yields were up slightly during the quarter to 4.7% as we redeployed cash and saw improvements in the performance of limited partnerships.
Turning next to the holding company, we continue to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, the holding company held cash and liquid securities of approximately $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the cash and liquid securities balance at the end of the quarter still reflects about $230 million of temporary tax benefits related to tax sharing agreements with our operating companies that we expect to pay to the operating companies later this year.  After adjusting for those temporary tax benefits, the holding company has about $950 million of cash and liquid securities. That balance is currently designated for our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividends sources of the holding company over the next 18 months. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was approximately 25%, which is in line with our long-term leverage target.
I'd like to now provide an update on our dividend goals for the year. Insurance and Wealth Management is on track and has paid $120 million through the end of the quarter with an interim dividend of $45 million approved to be paid in August to the holding company. This represents $165 million, over half of our $300 million goal for the year in the division. Regarding Global Mortgage Insurance, a challenging global economic environment and the concern by us and our the regulators of the potential contagion risk if economic conditions worsen, is impacting views on the level of capital hold above our regulatory minimum requirements. We now expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012 as compared to our earlier target of $160 million. We will continue to manage capital and performance, look to execute additional reinsurance treaties and monitor market conditions. We do still expect to maintain a buffer at the holding company of $350 million over our 2x debt service target throughout the rest of this year.
Given the interest in long-term care on the part of the many investors and analysts, I thought it would be useful to provide a brief overview of our reserving process. First, let me break out my actuarial hat and give some background for those who aren't actuaries or accountants. We hold 2 main types of reserves: active life reserves and disabled life reserves. Active life reserves represent the excess of the present value of expected future benefits over the present value of the portion of premiums determined at issue required to fund expected benefits. The difference between the policy premium and this valuation premium funds both expected profits and expenses. The assumptions underlying these reserves are slightly different for GAAP and statutory reporting rules, but are generally a combination of best estimate and prescribed conservatism respectively. Disabled life reserves are held for policies on claims and are established using best estimates for factors such as morbidity, mortality, recovery and continuums [ph]. Disabled life reserves are released as claims are paid or in the event the claimant dies. We recently completed a comprehensive claims analysis which covered 160,000 long-term care claims dating all the way back to 1976. Our analysis tracked claim development by age, gender and underwriting generation, which were all key factors in determining claims costs. The analysis includes in the evaluation of all components of the claims life cycle, including length of claim, utilization of contractually available benefits and the transition of claimants from one state of care to another, such as when they move from home care to a nursing home. We gained several  useful insights on trends of performance of our in-force business as a result of this study. In addition, this evaluation gave us an updated view into the performance of policies for lifetime benefits versus those without them. We will integrate experience from this analysis into our claim reserving methodology in the third quarter and expect only a minor impact on total claim reserve levels. This analysis is also instructive with respect to future product pricing and design.
Finally, reserve adequacy is reviewed at least annually on both a GAAP and statutory reserving basis, not only by management, but also by several independent third parties. The board's audit committee receives and reviews reports on reserves as well. Tests based on recent experience, combined with input from third-party reviews, lead us to believe that given what we know today, current reserves in aggregate are adequate at this time. We will continue to closely monitor emerging experience and trends.
Let me wrap up. I'm very excited about our plans and the upside that we have at Genworth. We are moving forward to build our financial strength and our strategic flexibility for our shareholders. At the same time, the mixed operating results this quarter illustrate and confirm the importance of the changes that we're making to improve business performance.  With our dedicated and talented employees, we are leaning hard into the work ahead to turn Genworth around. 
Now let me turn it over to Pat to dig a bit deeper into the long-term care and Life businesses."
8598029,212592471,337293,"Genworth Financial Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Genworth Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our life insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes.  In our life insurance bu",1600,"Thanks, Marty. Today, I will provide some additional perspective on our life insurance business and give some additional color on our long-term care business performance, along with recent and planned product and pricing changes.  In our life insurance business, term life insurance mortality is a key earnings driver. Focusing on the past 10 quarters, we've seen favorable actual to expected mortality levels compared with our pricing assumptions. Those levels have been 93% for all of 2010, 90% for all of 2011, with quarterly variation between 83% to 96% and most recently, 98% and 100% in the first 2 quarters of 2012. As a result, our second quarter earnings in the Life Insurance business were lower from increased term life insurance mortality experience when compared to the prior year. Although historical mortality experience is generally favorable to pricing, the second quarter results demonstrate that after 3 consecutive quarters of relatively low levels of mortality, we've now had 2 consecutive quarters at higher levels. Our analysis indicates that this experience is normal volatility in the range that can be expected and consistent with pricing.
Next I'll provide a short update regarding the NAIC's recently exposed actuarial guideline 38 proposals to change the statutory valuation for universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. Separate rules are being proposed for new and for in-force business. The proposed effective date for addressing any impact on in-force reserves is December 31, 2012, while the proposed effective date for new business is January 1, 2013. For new business, the expected outcome associated with proposed changes will be material increases to statutory reserves over time. Not unlike the changes previously made to the traditional term product valuations in 1999, we realize that any such changes to AG 38 will require that all companies, including Genworth, review and potentially revise product offerings, pricing and utilization of reinsurance while rebalancing the value proposition for consumers and for shareholders.  We've already begun this work and anticipate changes in our product portfolio with new product solutions expected to be in place as these new regulations become effective in the market.
Now turning to our long-term care business. Current quarter financial results were lower sequentially, primarily reflecting lower claim termination and higher claim severity. Claim terminations are comprised of mortality, claim recovery and benefit exhaustion components. While exhaustion tends to be more stable, the impact of mortality and claim recoveries can be more volatile from quarter-to-quarter. In the past few quarters, we have seen these quarterly variations contribute to variability in results. As an example, a 0.5% change in the quarterly claim termination rate can impact earnings in a single quarter by approximately $9 million. On an annual basis, our claim termination rates have shown more stability.
Looking past the quarterly results, we've spent considerable time over the past few months focused on the composition of our long-term care portfolio and the performance of various segments of this portfolio over time. I will share key aspects of our analysis to provide context for both our revised strategy and approach for re-rating the in-force business and for the new business pricing and product changes we are implementing. We posted on our website a document to provide additional information on our portfolio. 
Going to Slide 3. This slide gives some perspective on differences between our old generation and new generation products. As you can see, our approach to pricing and underwriting criteria has evolved over time. We have monitored our extensive claims experience and made adjustments to our product offerings to enhance our risk and return profile by updating the underlying morbidity lapse and interest rate pricing assumptions as new product offerings were introduced. Our old generation blocks of business were marketed through roughly 2003 and have historically produced GAAP basis loss ratios around 90% to 104% annually over the last 4 years, with some quarterly variation.  This compares to the price for lifetime loss ratio of 60% to 65%. Our new generation blocks of business generally have been performing much better as a result of these changes and have generated returns in the mid-teens with annual loss ratios of approximately 50% in aggregate over the last 4 years, again, with some quarterly variations. This compares with price for our lifetime loss ratios of 60% to 65%. We would anticipate that the loss ratios on these blocks would increase moderately over time as the blocks age. 
On Slide 4, we provide profiles of the product series that comprise our old generation and new generation blocks of business. From our most recent comprehensive claims analysis, we have observed that product design has also played an important role in the development and performance of these blocks. While the old generation blocks experienced significant losses primarily due to price for lapse assumptions much higher than the actual lapse experienced. It should also be noted that policies with lifetime benefits are projected to perform worse than policies with non-lifetime benefits. Over time, we have seen a decrease in the percentage of policies issued with lifetime benefits from the pricing actions we've taken to reduce the percentage of business sold with this benefit structure.
Moving to Slide 5. With this in mind, I would like to discuss a change in our strategy and approach to re-rating in-force business and our plans to implement further rate increases beginning over the next several quarters, focusing first on the performance of our older issued policies.  In 2007 and 2010, we initiated premium rate increases of approximately 10% and 18%, respectively, on the majority of our older series of policies. Later this month, we will begin filing a new round of premium rate increases with several goals in mind. On the older issued policies that have been rated before, we intend to achieve average premium increases in excess of 50% over the next 5 years. Previously, we had asked for more frequent, lower increases, but we will pursue fewer,  larger increases going forward. We will work with individual states to determine the timing of these increases and give policyholders transparency into the plans of the company over time.
Similar to the premium rate increases on our old generation block, we will be seeking approval for premium rate increases for the majority of policyholders in the earliest series of our new generation policies. This block of policies has generated positive operating earnings, but is falling short of the original price for returns due to lower interest rates, higher claims due to an unfavorable business mix and lower lapse rates than expected. I should note that we had used a 2% ultimate lapse rate in pricing this product series. We want to stay ahead of this block of business with our in-force premium rating strategy, and we'll therefore request an average premium rate increase in excess of 25% over the next 5 years. We believe that early intervention on the newer block is important to managing the long-term performance of this business.  Subject to regulatory approvals, we anticipate these premium rate increases in total will generate approximately $200 million to $300 million of additional annual premium when fully implemented. 
For new business, on July 30, we implemented several changes to our current Privileged Choice Flex product, which accounts for approximately 70% of our new sales to increase margins and reduce risks. In order to mitigate morbidity in investment risks, we suspended sales of policies with unlimited benefits. In response to the low-interest rate environment, we also suspended sales of limited pay contracts. The current product had been priced with a 4.5% investment yield assumption and the current rate environment presents heightened risk for limited pay contracts. In addition, we announced price increases through the reduction of our couples discount and the elimination of our Preferred Health Discount.  These changes effectively raise premium levels by approximately 20%. Finally, we further tightened our underwriting requirements, including the requirement to obtain family history during underwriting and new underwriting criteria, which result in classifying applicants with a family history of schizophrenia as uninsurable. 
Shifting to Slide 6 in our new business strategy. The product changes we just covered were made as an interim step to introducing a new product series in the first half of 2013. The 2013 product, which will replace Privileged Choice Flex, will include certain transformative concepts that have been long accepted in life insurance pricing and underwriting, but which are new to long-term care. Specifically,  we will begin requiring blood and lab underwriting requirements to better assess certain health conditions such as diabetes that can impact the morbidity of an applicant in future years. Also, the pricing will include premium rates that will be differentiated based on gender to reflect the different claims experience of male and female policyholders. In addition to these changes, the new product will have updated pricing, including an investment yield assumption more in line with today's environment. Finally, we will no longer provide lifetime benefits.  The filing process for this new product is well underway with approvals from several states already received. 
We are committed to improving the financial performance of our long-term care portfolio and revising our new business product offerings to create a favorable risk reward profile while effectively addressing marketplace needs. We've embarked on a major strategic shift in our approach to in-force management, shifting from our previous incremental rate increase philosophy to a more aggressive and focused strategy of multiyear rate increases to improve our risk and return profile in the old generation block and to get ahead of any issues in the performance of the newer generation block.  Now I will open it up for questions."

I'm also trying to figure out how that fits in with your statement that the current debt leverage ratio is in line with long-term targets?"

Thanks for your question. As we think about debt, we wanted to kind of point out just so everybody kind of has a common understanding of kind of leverage and kind of talk about it because in aggregate, we certainly felt it's appropriate for the mix of businesses we have. But as certain investors think about separation or other business actions we might take, we wanted to point out that leverage targets are obviously different for different types of businesses. So part of it was really to educate folks. We do want to not only increase and improve our business performance, but we want to increase our financial flexibility. And so as we work in developing our strategic businesses, we're going to hopefully be improving significantly over time their earnings profile, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. But we also, as we think of managing financial investments, companies that we -- or businesses, I should say, that we view as financial investments, we'll be managing them and using them as a way to generate capital. As we generate capital, I'd say there's different things we could do and we'll assess that at the appropriate time. Certainly, delevering is one possibility and that would give us more flexibility. And if a split seem to make sense at that point in time, it's -- we could go down that path a bit more. But obviously, share repurchase is something that has been on the mind of investors and we'll look at that. And also, we want to make sure that our balance sheets in our businesses are strong and our strategic businesses are able to perform. So those are all things that we'll be thinking about as we generate capital and we'll assess how to use the proceeds at that point in time. We'll obviously be thinking about it well in advance to that, but we'll make that final call as we get closer. I would say, over time, we do expect to probably bring down leverage a bit, but we'll talk about more specific plans about that down the road."

We realize it's extremely low relative to book and that could be very accretive to shareholder. So we look very, very closely at that.

This is very consistent with that strategy. We want to continue to reduce affiliate reinsurance coverage and we also want to continue to support the development of a stable and active mortgage insurance reinsurance market, which is something we've had considerable benefit from throughout the first half of this year as we've added other external reinsurance.

This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update o",3459,"Thanks, Georgette, and good morning, everyone. before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy. This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update on the holding company, including credit rating situation and review third quarter on our businesses. 
In developing the strategy, our highest priority has been to rebuild value for shareholders. Working with the Board of Directors, the management team has developed and began executing specific plans to both safeguard and maximize the value of the company for shareholders. We intend to accomplish that goal by achieving the return in equity in each of our core operating businesses in excess of its-related cost of capital, generating significant cash flow to the holding company from core business dividends and realizing value from our non-core businesses and enhancing financial flexibility by first, managing the core businesses to enable them to be stand-alone on an operating and debt basis, and second, deleveraging to enhance cash flow, reducing the burden on the holding company and placing the company on better footing with rating industries in the credit markets. As part of this process, we have identified 2 core sets of businesses: the U.S. Life Insurance businesses to which include Life, Long-term Care and fixed annuity; and Global Mortgage Insurance, which includes the U.S., Canada, Australia and other markets. 
The businesses we have identified is non-core include International Protection, Wealth Management, and, of course, the runoff segment, which includes primarily variable annuities. Each of these 2 core businesses, u.S. left Global Mortgage Insurance, has been evaluated on its potential to provide significant competitive advantages, deliver new business returns above its related cost of capital will covering it's full expense base and ultimately, produce capital and employable cash that covers the cost of it's appropriate share of debt and supports it desired ratings. 
Managing our core businesses with these goals will reduce interdependencies and subsidization among of businesses in order to improve financial performance and flexibility. The performance of each of businesses will be regularly evaluated against these criteria. For example, if the business is not delivering acceptable new business returns, we will evaluate available options to address this issue and ensure it does not continue. As performance in the core businesses improve, we believe our financial strength and flexibility will improve as well. This flexibility should provide potential opportunities to take additional steps. For example, to the sale or spin-off of businesses if that would further increase shareholder value. Our core businesses have significant opportunities to leverage their strengths to earn attractive returns, given the underserved middle-market for Life Insurance, the growing consumer need for long-term care, the developing U.S. housing market recovery and the continuing development of the housing markets in various international countries. 
However, we also recognize that we are operating in an environment with the macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory and rating agency challenges. We're also working to overcome underperforming in-force portfolios, a relatively high cost of capital and interdependencies among the individual businesses and with the holding company and flexibility. 
In each core business, we have 4 key areas of focus: Rebalancing the business risk profile, writing profitable new business, improving returns on the in-force portfolio and supporting holding company with liquidity and flexibility. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we are working to rebalance the business risk through the partial sale of our Australia MI company and narrow our footprint in Europe given the uncertain economic outlook and increased use of third party reinsurance. In the U.S., Australia and Canada, we are prudently managing our capital and pursuing various ways to utilize that capital in the most efficient and productive way possible. 
In Europe, we are writing new Mortgage Insurance business in only 4 countries, where business conditions enable us to achieve attractive returns. We're encouraged by the continued improving trends in the U.S. housing market, and we continuance expect that the U.S. Mortgage Insurance business will return to profitability during 2013. We remain focused on executing loss mitigation strategies, maintaining our distribution network and writing profitable new businesses through labors, GRMAC or potential type options. At the same time, we are actively pursuing solutions to reduce linkages with and dependencies on holding company.
Our businesses in Canada and Australia continue to write profitable new business and deliver dividends to the withholding company. While our smaller book of new business are utilizing less capital in these platforms, we are working with the regulators to evaluate capital levels more cautiously in this economic environment. 
In our U.S. Life Insurance business, our primary focus is on improving the performance of the in-force business through long-term care in-force price actions, life block transactions and refinancing of life reserves. We're also working to improve the new business profile of both life and long-term care by managing portfolio sales, as well as redesigning products to reduce risk, improve profitability and maximize capital efficiency. The goal is to provide the regular ordinary dividends to the holding company beginning in 2013. 
In our non-core businesses, we will manage new businesses to enhance the value that can be realized, like generating cash and capital, for example, through an ultimate sale. Our priorities in managing our non-core businesses are as follows: In International Protection, we will maximize the embedded value of the overall business through resizing the current European franchise, while contributing to execute on growth opportunities in new markets. We are significantly narrowing the focus in Europe to key relationships and using appropriate pricing to protect margins during the prolonged financial crisis. This will enable us to reduce corresponding infrastructure costs. These changes will add to the embedded value of the business, while maintaining significant dividends to the holding company, enhancing our ability to realize increase value from the potential sale of business through the next 2 to 3 years, and as economic and business conditions permit. 
Wealth Management is an attractive business with a strong competitive position and continuing growth potential, and we believe it can also be a significant source of capital. We continue to invest in investment solutions and new capabilities to support the financial devices we serve and to increase the value of the business. We will also be evaluating opportunities to ultimately realize that value at the appropriate time.
All of these actions support our goals of building strength and flexibility at the holding company. We are positioning our core businesses to pay consistent dividends, while generating cash and capital from our non-core businesses. While our current leverage ratio of 25% is appropriate for diversified settable businesses, we are moving to a medium term leverage target of 20% to 22%. This reduced leverage target is more appropriate for the core businesses on a standalone basis and will increase our financial and strategic flexibility and should also benefit our ratings over time. 
As additional capital is generated, we will evaluate how best to deploy it. These options include: First, strengthening the balance sheet and performance of our businesses where appropriate; second, reducing leverage to increase flexibility; and third, returning capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases. These options will review to how best increase shareholder value at the time.
Successful execution of this turnaround strategy should increase the earnings and ROE in our core insurance businesses, while also generating cash and capital that will increase financial strength and flexibility. I should also note that the Board continues to be actively engaged in CEO search process, working with Russell Reynolds, and is making good progress. Let me now cover some topics of the holding company.
We continue to generate and to maintain significant liquidity. And the end of the third quarter, cash and liquid securities at the holding company totaled about $1.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, we will payout approximately $375 million to the operating companies related to tax agreements with them. This includes the $230 million of temporary tax benefits being held at the holding company, which we noted last quarter. 
After reflecting those upcoming payments, the holding company has about $1 billion in cash and liquid securities, in line with our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividends in the holding company over the next 18 months. We expect the year end cash balance to also be in line with that target. 
Regarding dividends to the holding company, the insurance of Wealth Management division remains on track with its 2012 goal of $300 million, having paid $236 million through the end of the third quarter. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we continue to expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012, with $30 million paid year-to-date from the Canada ordinary dividend. 
Also, the company signed an agreement this month to sell its home equity access business for $22 million. This transaction is expected to close in early 2013 with no significant gain or loss from the sell impacting corporate and other activities.
Now I'd like to touch on the actions of the rating agencies during the quarter. First in our view, Moody's recent decision to extend the review of our holding company into U.S. Mortgage Insurance recognizes the plans that we have developed to increase our financial strength and flexibility. While S&P also acknowledge this, we were disappointed that they chose to take ratings actions before we had made further progress in our plans. We believe that as we execute our strategic plan, our financial strength and flexibility will improve, which should stabilize and ultimately improve our ratings. However, in the meantime, we took steps to prepare for potentially adverse ratings actions. We do not believe the downgrade by S&P or the potential action by Moody's will have a material impact from the commercial liquidity or financial perspective. 
From a commercial perspective, there has been no significant change in the ability to write new businesses or on the capacity or willingness of the counterparties to enter into hedging transactions. The holding company does not have any long-term debt maturities until June of 2014 and $600 million of long term debt maturities. We plan to address this step well in advance of its maturity date. 
Along with the strategic plan discussed earlier, we continue to work with regulators and rating agencies to develop comprehensive solutions for U.S. MI. We are seeking to address rating agency concerns and fulfill our commitment to pay all our valid claims, while safeguarding the liquidity, capital and shareholder value in Genworth. At first, increasing financial flexibility for Genworth and U.S. MI by reducing U.S. MI's dependency on holding company; second, preserving holding company liquidity buffers and other liquid assets; and third, sustaining U.S. MI's access to profitable NIW markets. 
Alternatives under consideration include internal reorganization and potential new coast structures. These alternatives could require some form of capital contribution, none of which is expected to be material to holding company target liquidity or buffer. These alternatives also do not rely on our capital generation plans, nor do they rely on additional contribution of mixed shares. We believe that a run-off, spin-off or sale of U.S. MI or the amendment of our bond indentures are not the most beneficial options for shareholders at this time. We will provide updates as we move forward further on these plans.
Now let's turn to third quarter results, where  we reported operating income of $121 million for the quarter and net income of $34 million, which reflects the goodwill write-off in the International Protection. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we saw continued progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $56 million compared to income of $51 million the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, stronger results in Australia as the performance in the portfolio continues to improve and consistent performance in the U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $57 million. Unemployment was stable and home prices were up slightly from some continued regional variation. Lower interest rates have improved the affordability and consumer sentiment. The loss ratio for the quarter was 47%, which is down 7 points sequentially. 
Overall, delinquencies were down 10% with new delinquencies incurred improving across all major states. While paid claims are elevated, reserves remain largely in line with the trends we anticipated following the first quarter reserve strengthening. We continue to manage capital against the backdrop of increasing regulatory capital expectations given the uncertain global environment. We were evaluating additional reinsurance to manage the capital levels, while balancing the increased cost and impact on overall returns. 
Executing a partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to Mortgage Insurance risk and generating capital. While the performance of the business is recovering, the increasing regulatory capital expectations and uncertain market conditions on Australia for initial public offering have impacted both evaluation and timing. We remain committed to a partial sale, but given our liquid at the holding company and the other leverage that we have is generating cash and capital, transaction makes the most sense for shareholders. 
Execution of an IPO is subject to market valuation and regulatory considerations, and we do not now expect an IPO to occur prior to late 2013. 
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, unemployment was stable sequentially and home prices were down slightly. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 30% as overall delinquencies were down 9% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues, and changes to eligibility rules for government guarantee mortgages that went into effect in July of this year are likely to reduce the size of the high loan to volume mortgage insurance market. The capital position remains solid in Canada. 
The operating loss of other countries in the international mortgage segment improved somewhat to $5 million sequentially, driven by reduction and losses primarily on Ireland. 
Moving now to U.S. MI, we had a net operating loss of $38 million in the quarter, effectively flat sequentially after adjusting for a $12 million benefit from the termination of an external reinsurance contract in the second quarter. We're seeing a slow recovery in housing market, and the mortgage assurance market is improving, and we have seen strong growth driven by our larger mortgage origination market and higher mor gage purchase penetration in the quarter, the highest since 2008. 
Total losses were flat sequentially, as a seasonal increase in new delinquencies and lower self cure activity was offset by loss mitigation and modest changes in aging. 
Our total flow delinquencies by 19% from the prior year, with new delinquencies up 5% sequentially from seasonality, down 24% year-over-year, reflecting the continued burn through of the 2005 to 2008 books and the new better performing books becoming a larger portion of our overall portfolio. 
With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk of capital ratios above 25:1 in GEMICO. 
Finally, during the quarter, the GSEs granted stranded GRMAC an extension of the ability to write new businesses in nonwaiver states through 2013. Considering these improvement macroeconomic fundamentals, the continuing of government programs, lower modifications, the continued burn through of the unprofitable books of business and the growth of new books was a 20% plus ROE, we expect U.S. MI to return to profitability during 2013. 
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management division, reported operating earnings were $104 million. Life Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter. We saw higher term life mortality experience in the quarter, which is the third straight elevated quarter after 3 quarters of more favorable experience when compared to pricing assumptions. Fluctuations and mortality can occur, but we have not identified any systemic trends. 
Life Insurance sales were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with the pricing and product actions taken this year as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect to complete our Second Life book transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012. Initial phases of the transaction began in the third quarter, and we recorded an associated GAAP loss of $6 million this quarter. We expect the capital benefit to be in excess of $100 million in the fourth quarter when the transactions are completed. 
On October 22, we announced changes to our Life Insurance portfolio, designed to update our product offerings and further adjust pricing to reflect the current low interest rate environment and regulatory changes. Under the new AG 38 guidelines, we have determined that approximately 7% of our universal Life Insurance reserves is subject to the new regulations, which require additional reserve adequacy testing. While our analysis is not yet complete, we do not expect a significant financial impact related to the new reserving requirements on our in-force reserves subject to the new guidance.
Long-term care earnings were up for the quarter at $45 million. We had $29 million of favorable reserve adjustments impacting results for both active life and disabled life reserves, primarily as a result of the continued multistage system conversion. As of the end of the third quarter, reserve should both GAAP and stat are adequate. After adjusting for the reserve items, the loss ratio was approximately 74%, which is flat to the prior quarter. Our previously announced 18% premium rate increase on the majority of the older issued policies continued to take effect. With respect to the recently initiated in-force price actions, through October 26, we have met with 20 state and recently attributable submitted filings in 18 states. We also have approval from 2 states to begin implementation in the fourth quarter of this year.
Fixed annuity earnings were $19 million, and sales in this line were up from the second quarter even as we continue to take actions to maintain margins. International Protection earnings were $8 million for the quarter. The business continues to navigate a tough consumer lending environment. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 18% versus the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year. Given the impact of the continued challenging economic environment in Europe on the goodwill analysis in the quarter, we recorded an after-tax goodwill impairment of $86 million, which is all of the goodwill related to this business. 
As part of the plans to increase values through growth in new markets, we commenced a relationship with Map 3, a leading insurer in Latin America to utilize their distribution to excess market in South America. Wealth Management were $10 million and business continues to provide steady earnings and dividends, including dividends of $30 million year-to-date. 
Turning to capital. The U.S. Life companies risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 420%, up from the second quarter. RBC benefited from favorable taxes, as well as positive statutory income in the quarter. The ratio also reflects the extraordinary $50 million dividend paid to the holding company in the quarter from the Medicare supplement sale.
At the end of the third quarter, surplus was approximately $180 million and statutory operating income was approximately $590 million year-to-date. We still expect to achieve the 2012 surplus target of $250 million to $300 million that we laid out in February. These goals were high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our life companies in 2013. 
Finally, in the corporate and runoff division, results in the runoff segment improved from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by unfavorable market conditions. 
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio continues to perform well. We have updated the analysis we gave back in our February 3rd investor call regarding the impact from the extended lower rate environment earnings per share. The updated analysis shows on additional impact of $0.01 to $0.02 per share in 2013 and 2014, primarily due to lower projected earnings in Australia related to the rate cuts made throughout of 2012. 
Let me wrap up so we can take questions. Last year, we've seen several challenges for Genworth. We are now tackling those challenges head on and we will put them behind us. We must turn our company around in turn the page to the next stage for Genworth. With our competitive strength and with our talented team of employees, who provide valuable products and services to our customers, we are working to realize the many opportunities that we have to rebuild the shareholder value. In doing so, we will build a stronger company, which will benefit all of our stakeholders. We are moving quickly and urgently on our action plans, and look forward to updating you on our progress. 
And now, Let's turn it over for questions."

Then obviously, as we generate capital from the things that we talked about earlier, that will obviously give us the opportunity to accelerate that."

And the stability that we've seen for now a couple of quarters in our results. I think what continues not so much to change but to evolve down there is some of the capital pressure from regulatory capital standpoint. And basically, the regulator in this environment, as Marty mentioned in his opening remarks, the regulators are cautious in these market right now. The other thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of is this what's going on in the overall market for IPOs in Australia. There's simply been no material IPOs of any size down in that market this year. And that's why I think there remains some uncertainly in that market regarding the ability to tap into the market from that standpoint. We do remain committed to a partial sale. I think the thing that's most changed for us though is we think about it is we're going to do where it makes the most sense for our shareholders. And in our view at this point in time, is that our valuations should improve in that market as we move towards the end of the year. Moving performance, subsequent quarters of improving performance will continue to help that,will continue to help the valuation improvement, and again, that's one we're targeting at this point, because we think it will be the one that will generate the best outcome for our shareholders."

So it didn't change materially.

We do think it's very important as we improve our business performance, as well as our financial flexibility that we manage the businesses on that kind of standalone  basis that we talked about. And I think there's a few different things that we want to look at. We want to make sure that as we have goals for the businesses with respect to the returns, to return equity, particularly as we're writing new business, for example, and that we look at that expected ROE when we're pricing and developing product, and we want that to be in excess of the appropriate cost of capital for that particular business line. As you can imagine, different businesses and different risk performances, different vendors, so obviously their cost of capital should vary. Our order return equity should vary along with that. And also different businesses and different amounts of debt, different amounts of leverage that they can carry. For example, a stable portfolio, Life Insurance businesses, could really have a leverage 22% to 25% may be 26%. For Mortgage Insurance platforms, that's a lower type of range. You're looking at typically around 15%, maybe as high as 18% and as low as 12%. So you got different amounts of leverage. So we want to make sure that each of our operating businesses is being running away that can support its specific debt leverage, as well as an appropriate target for that. And then finally, we want to make sure that we're covering all of the expense loads in our pricing, and that there's not any kind of reliance and support from other businesses or from the holding company to do some things and then priced in into our products."

For examples, we're pricing Mortgage Insurance, we're going to assume that we are able lever it at a 15% number instead of an overall 25% number, which has been we've been doing. We're operating at a combined leverage of 24% to 26%, which we're a diverse set of businesses to make things entirely appropriate. But we want to make sure for our pricing, and those types of returns that we're really looking at the businesses to be priced for their particular debt load that's appropriate. So in case of MI for example, we'll be looking to price more of the 15% leverage assumption as opposed to 24% to 25% leverage assumption. Similarly, we want to look at on the other side of the coin. We look at, for example, long-term care returns and while the overall diversified set of life businesses, you might want to have a cost of capital look at it at 11% to 12%. We realize that for long-term care particularly, it's a higher number. It's been a risker product that we are working to change that risk profile through underwriting and pricing and product design. But we think long-term care, for example, has a cost of equity is probably 13% to 15%, maybe even 16%. So we need to make sure that pricing that it carries or covers that particular cost of equity. Does that help you?"

I'll provide the extent of the color that I can, given where we are in these discussions with the various stakeholders. I think the way we think about U.S. MI and what we're really trying to drive there is, #1, we're going to continue to write as much of that profitable business as we can under the waivers that have currently been granted to us by our home domiciliary state regulators, as well as the other state regulators across the country. Secondly, we have the additional potential to write business through another subsidiary that we talked about our GRMAC subsidiary, and we're only writing in a very narrow handful of states there right now that haven't provided the waivers. So in the next possibility you could do there is just think of that as that enough capital in it, to write sort of 50 state type production for about 6 to 12 months. So that's another opportunity. Then you start getting to -- I think  the real the question, which is what are some of these other structure alternatives? And I'll just say, we're on an ongoing discussions with our regulators, with the GSEs, to consider various alternatives that we could -- really when we -- they're really in confidential discussion right now, but as we get closer to the point, when we can bring back and talk with you about them, we'll be glad to do that. One example could be an alternate use of the GRMAC entity and doing something with that structurally. So all on track, these are good potential structural alternatives for us, but really I'd say where were start with is with our current waivers, we're in good shape and be able to continue write to places where we're writing. Lasting I'll just add on to that is when we think about some of these new code structures or alternative structures, one of the GRMAC they might give us the ability to do is to provide an avenue to bring in some external capital outside of Genworth in the event that that's the alternative that we needed to be able to write new business, and it would've be reliant then at that point at our own internal capital."

I'll hit sort of some of macro assumptions, as well as just point to some of the of trends that we're seeing right now and how we feel about those. Back in when we gave sort of our expectation that we have up path to profitability back in February, as said we're going to have burn out of 2005, 2008 books where we're seeing that. We thought we're going to have, and that was all based upon an adequacy of our reserves. We're seeing that. It was based upon eventually the record performance of the new books of business starting to outweigh the bad books of business, and we're were seeing that happen today. The market that we're seeing for Mortgage Insurance is coming back for us to be able to operate and participate in is in excess of what we had expected back in February at that time. Our share levels are generally holding up, so the combination of that improvement in purchase penetration that's creating the bigger mortgage insurance market, the good pricing we have and our share performance is helping us. We said we are going to continue to expect loss mitigation benefits at that point. I think we take about $300 million and $400 million we're coming through and we're going to be exceeding those targets. So we feel good there. When you sort of bring it back all those things and bring them together, we're just on the glide path towards keeping the profitability as we expect in February. The last thing I think we said at the time was our overall delinquencies and new delinquencies, we're going to go down about 20%, more on track year-to-date, it's down 23%. So all those trends are heading in the right direction. Getting back to your macro question, we're still expecting, we're going to have -- unemployment is not going to change materially from here on out. We're still going to  be operating not much help from a growing employment base. Anything that accelerates that right now from the current level could be good tailwind for us, but we're not expecting any material improvement in unemployment. And in fact, we expect to be sort of elevated throughout 2014. On the peak, on HPA basis, we think we sort of trough and we've hit the bottom at about a total 20% downturn from the high in the FHA index. And we would expect that to have a slow and gradual growth going forward from here, and we're still read more about that here in the press today as it materializes out there. So just directionally, all our trends are really heading in the right direction. We feel good about it. The new books are about to get to that inflection point. When they start to tip over the experience on the old legacy books, and we're encourage by what we're seeing."

If you just think about our regulatory capital levels that we're holding to, as you saw in the quarter, our MCR levels came down a bit from where they were in the previous quarter. We have told you that was going to happen after our second quarter call, largely the result of the elimination of some reinsurance, affiliate reinsurance that we had in the system that was being provided by the U.S. MI business. So one of the things we're working through is rebuilding and building that MCR backup into a level that we think will be more appropriate in that regulatory environment. And so think of that in the low end 40s to higher, maybe 150 MCR type level. So we're doing that through the continued improvements in our business performance. We're doing it to looking at other ways to managing the capital perhaps by the usage of some reinsurance. And so you're going to -- we're working through those things with the business right now. They have implications to ultimately the ROE of the business. How much capital you hold is really driving what's the ROE of that business, what's the ROE of that business over a forecasted period of time that you could disclose. When you're doing some type of public, some type of IPO type process, and that all drives valuation. So at the end of the day ,it all comes back to valuation.

Because if you were to look at the reinsurance support, it potentially would be a lot better after we complete those relating processes rather than before. So while right now, our existing business plan is looking at the relating processes as a means of mitigating the loses on the older book and, thereby improving the profitability of the book overall.

Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update",3485,"Thanks, Georgette, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.
This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update on the holding company, including our credit rating situation and review third quarter results in our businesses.
In developing a strategy, our highest priority has been to rebuild value for shareholders. Working with the Board of Directors, the management team has developed and begun executing specific plans to both safeguard and maximize the value of the company for shareholders. We intend to accomplish that goal by achieving return in equity in each of our core operating businesses in excess of its related cost of capital, generating significant cash flow to the holding company from core business dividends and realizing value from our non-core businesses and enhancing financial flexibility by: first, managing the core businesses to enable them to be standalone on an operating and debt basis; and second, deleveraging to enhance cash flow, reducing the burden on the holding company and placing the company on better footing with rating indices in the credit markets.
As part of this process, we have identified 2 core sets of businesses: the U.S. Life Insurance businesses, that which include life, long-term care and fixed annuities; and Global Mortgage Insurance, which includes the U.S., Canada, Australia and other markets.
The businesses we have identified as non-core include International Protection, Wealth Management, and of course, the Runoff segment, which includes primarily variable annuities. Each of these 2 core businesses, U.S. Life and Global Mortgage Insurance, has been evaluated on its potential to provide significant competitive advantages, deliver new business returns above its related cost of capital while covering its full expense base and ultimately, produce capital and employable cash that covers the cost of its appropriate share of debt and supports its desired ratings.
Managing our core businesses with these goals will reduce interdependencies and subsidizations among businesses in order to improve financial performance and flexibility. The performance of each of business will be regularly evaluated against this criteria. For example, if a business is not delivering acceptable new business returns, we will evaluate available options to address this issue and ensure it does not continue.
As performance in the core businesses improves, we believe our financial strength and flexibility will improve as well. This flexibility should provide potential opportunities to take additional steps, for example, to the sale or spinoff of businesses if that would further increase shareholder value. Our core businesses have significant opportunities to leverage their strengths to earn attractive returns, given the underserved middle market for life insurance, the growing consumer need for long-term care, the developing U.S. housing market recovery and the continuing development of the housing markets in various international countries.
However, we also recognize that we are operating in an environment with macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory and writing industry challenges. We're also working to overcome underperforming in-force portfolios, a relatively high cost of capital and interdependencies among the individual businesses and with the holding company that impede flexibility.
In each core business, we have 4 key areas of focus: Rebalancing the business risk profile, writing profitable new business, improving returns on the in-force portfolio and supporting holding company liquidity and flexibility.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we are working to rebalance the business risk through the partial sale of our Australia MI company and narrow our footprint in Europe given the uncertain economic outlook and increase the use of third-party reinsurance.
In the U.S., Australia and Canada, we are prudently managing our capital and pursuing various ways to utilize that capital in the most efficient and productive way possible.
In Europe, we are writing new mortgage insurance business in only 4 countries where business conditions enable us to achieve attractive returns. We're encouraged by the continued improving trends in the U.S. housing market, and we continue to expect that the U.S. Mortgage Insurance business will return to profitability during 2013. We remain focused on executing loss mitigation strategies, maintaining our distribution network and writing profitable new business through waivers, GRMAC or a potential new code-type options. At the same time, we are actively pursuing solutions to reduce linkages with and dependencies on the holding company.
Our businesses in Canada and Australia continue to write profitable new business and deliver dividends to the holding company. While smaller books of new business were utilizing less capital on these platforms, we are working with the regulators as they evaluate capital levels more cautiously in this economic environment.
In our U.S. Life Insurance business, our primary focus is on improving the performance of the in-force business through long-term care in-force price actions, life block transactions and refinancing of life reserves. We're also working to improve the new business profile of both life and long-term care by managing portfolio sales, as well as redesigning products to reduce risk, to improve profitability and to maximize capital efficiency. The goal is to provide regular ordinary dividends to the holding company beginning in 2013.
In our non-core businesses, we will manage new business to enhance the value that can be realized, while generating cash and capital, for example, through an ultimate sale. Our priorities in managing our non-core businesses are as follows: In International Protection, we will maximize the embedded value of the overall business through resizing the current European franchise while continuing to execute on growth opportunities in new markets. We are significantly narrowing the focus in Europe to key relationships and using appropriate pricing to protect margins during the prolonged financial crisis. This will enable us to reduce corresponding infrastructure costs. These changes will add to the embedded value of the business while maintaining significant dividends to the holding company, enhancing our ability to realize increased value from a potential sale of the business in the next 2 to 3 years and as economic and business conditions permit.
Wealth Management is an attractive business with a strong competitive position and continuing growth potential, and we believe it can also be a significant source of capital. We continue to invest in investment solutions and new capabilities to support the financial advisers we serve and to increase the value of the business. We will also be evaluating opportunities to ultimately realize that value at the appropriate time.
All of these actions support our goals of building strength and flexibility at the holding company. We are positioning our core businesses to pay consistent dividends while generating cash and capital from our non-core businesses. While our current leverage ratio of 25% is appropriate for a diversified set of businesses, we are moving to a medium-term leverage target of 20% to 22%. This reduced leverage target is more appropriate for the core businesses on a standalone basis and will increase our financial and strategic flexibility and should also benefit our ratings over time.
As additional capital is generated, we will evaluate how best to deploy it. These options include: first, strengthening the balance sheets and performance of our businesses, where appropriate; second, reducing leverage to increase flexibility; and third, returning capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases. These options we'll review to the lengths of how best to increase shareholder value at the time.
Successful execution of this turnaround strategy should increase the earnings and ROE in our core insurance businesses while also generating cash and capital that will increase financial strength and flexibility. I should also note that the board continues to be actively engaged in the CEO search process, working with Russell Reynolds, and has made good progress.
Let me now cover some topics of the holding company. We continue to generate and to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, cash and liquid securities at the holding company totaled about $1.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, we will payout approximately $375 million to the operating companies related to tax-sharing agreements with them. This includes the $230 million of temporary tax benefits being held at the holding company which we noted last quarter.
After reflecting those upcoming payments, the holding company has about $1 billion in cash and liquid securities, in line with our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend sources to the holding company over the next 18 months. We expect the year-end cash balance to also be in line with that target.
Regarding dividends to the holding company, the Insurance and Wealth Management Division remains on track with the 2012 goal of $300 million, having paid $236 million through the end of the third quarter.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we continue to expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012, with $30 million paid year-to-date from the Canada ordinary dividend.
Also, the company signed an agreement this month to sell its home equity access business for $22 million. This transaction is expected to close in early 2013 with no significant gain or loss from the sale impacting corporate or other activities.
Now I'd like to touch on the actions of the rating agencies during the quarter. First in our view, Moody's recent decision to extend the review of our holding company and of the U.S. Mortgage Insurance recognizes the plans that we have developed to increase our financial strength and flexibility. While S&P also acknowledge this, we were disappointed that they chose to take ratings actions before we had made further progress on our plans. We believe that as we execute our strategic plan, our financial strength and flexibility will improve, which should stabilize and ultimately improve our ratings. However, in the meantime, we took steps to prepare for potentially adverse ratings actions. We do not believe the downgrade by S&P or the potential action by Moody's will have a material impact from a commercial liquidity or financial perspective.
From a commercial perspective, there has been no significant change in the ability to write new business or on the capacity or willingness of counter-parties to enter into hedging transactions. The holding company does not have any long-term debt maturities until June of 2014 when $600 million of long-term debt matures. We plan to address this debt well in advance of its maturity date.
Along with the strategic plan discussed earlier, we continue to work with regulators and rating agencies to develop comprehensive solutions for U.S. MI. We are seeking to address rating agency concerns and fulfill our commitment to pay all our valid claims, while safeguarding the liquidity, capital and shareholder value of Genworth by: first, increasing financial flexibility for Genworth and U.S. MI by reducing U.S. MI's dependency on the holding company; second, preserving the holding company liquidity buffers and other liquid assets; and third, sustaining U.S. MI's access to profitable NIW markets.
Alternatives under consideration include internal reorganizations and potential new cost structures. These alternatives could require some form of capital contribution, none of which is expected to be material to holding company target liquidity or buffers. These alternatives also do not rely on our capital generation plans, nor do they rely on additional contribution of mixed shares. We believe that a runoff, spinoff or sale of U.S. MI or the amendment of our bond indentures are not the most beneficial options for shareholders at this time. We will provide updates as we move forward further on these plans.
Now let's turn to third quarter results, where we reported operating income of $121 million for the quarter and net income of $34 million, which reflects the goodwill writeoff in the International Protection. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we saw continued progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $56 million compared to income of $51 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, stronger results in Australia as the performance in the portfolio continues to improve and consistent performance in the U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $57 million. Unemployment was stable and home prices were up slightly from some continued regional variation. Lower interest rates have improved the affordability and consumer sentiment. The loss ratio for the quarter was 47%, which is down 7 points sequentially.
Overall delinquencies were down 10%, with new delinquencies in cures improving across all major states. While paid claims are elevated, reserves remain largely in line with the trends we had anticipated following the first quarter reserve strengthening. We continue to manage capital against the backdrop of increasing regulatory capital expectations given the uncertain global environment. We were evaluating additional reinsurance treaties to manage the capital levels, while balancing the increased cost and impact on overall returns.
Executing a partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk and generating capital. While the performance of the business is recovering, the increasing regulatory capital expectations and uncertain market conditions on Australia for initial public offering can impact both valuation and timing. We remain committed to a partial sale, but given our liquidity at the holding company and the other leverage that we have to generate cash and capital, we'll execute a transaction where it makes the most sense for shareholders.
Execution of an IPO is subject to market valuation and regulatory considerations, and we do not now expect an IPO to occur prior to late 2013.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, unemployment was stable sequentially and home prices were down slightly. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 30%, as overall delinquencies were down 9% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues, and the changes to eligibility rules for government guarantee mortgages that went into effect in July of this year are likely to reduce the size of the high loan-to-value mortgage insurance market. Our capital position remains solid in Canada.
The operating loss of other countries in the international mortgage segment improved somewhat to $5 million sequentially, driven by a reduction in losses, primarily in Ireland.
Moving now to U.S. MI. We had a net operating loss of $38 million in the quarter, effectively flat sequentially after adjusting for a $12 million benefit from the termination of an external reinsurance contract in the second quarter. We're seeing a slow recovery in the housing market, and the mortgage insurance market is improving. And we have seen strong growth, driven by a larger mortgage origination market and higher mortgage insurance purchase penetration in the quarter, the highest since 2008.
Total losses were flat sequentially, as a seasonal increase in new delinquencies and lower self-cure activity was offset by loss mitigation and modest changes in aging.
Our total flow delinquencies fell by 19% from the prior year, with new delinquencies up 5% sequentially from seasonality, but down 24% year-over-year, reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 to 2008 books and the new better performing books becoming a larger portion of our overall portfolio.
With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk-to-capital ratios above 25:1 in GEMICO. 
Finally, during the quarter, the GSEs granted GRMAC an extension of the ability to write new business in non-waiver states through 2013. Considering these improving macroeconomic fundamentals, the continuation of government programs, loan modifications, the continued burn-through of the unprofitable books of business and the growth of new books with a 20% plus ROE, we expect U.S. MI to return to profitability during 2013.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management Division, reported operating earnings were $104 million. Life Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter. We saw higher term life mortality experience in the quarter, which is the third straight elevated quarter after 3 quarters of more favorable experience when compared to pricing assumptions. Fluctuations in mortality can occur, but we have not identified any systemic trends.
Life Insurance sales were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with the pricing and product actions taken this year as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect to complete our second life block transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012. The initial phases of the transaction began in the third quarter, and we recorded an associated GAAP loss of $6 million this quarter. We expect the capital benefit to be in excess of $100 million in the fourth quarter when the transaction is completed.
On October 22, we announced changes to our Life Insurance portfolio, designed to update our product offerings and further adjust pricing to reflect the current low interest rate environment and regulatory changes. Under the new AG 38 guidelines, we have determined that approximately 7% of our universal life insurance reserves are subject to the new regulations, which require additional reserve adequacy testing. While our analysis is not yet complete, we do not expect a significant financial impact related to the new reserving requirements on our in-force reserves subject to the new guidance.
Long-term care earnings were up for the quarter at $45 million. We had $29 million of favorable reserve adjustments impacting results for both active life and disabled life reserves, primarily as a result of the continued multistage system conversion. As of the end of the third quarter, reserves for booked GAAP and stat [ph] are adequate.
After adjusting for the reserve items, the loss ratio was approximately 74%, which is flat to the prior quarter. Our previously announced 18% premium rate increase on the majority of the older-issued policies continues to take effect. With respect to the recently initiated in-force price actions, through October 26, we have met with 20 states and recently submitted filings in 18 states. We also have approval from 2 states to begin implementation in the fourth quarter of this year.
Fixed annuity earnings were $19 million, and sales in this line were up from the second quarter even as we continue to take actions to maintain margins. International Protection earnings were $8 million for the quarter. The business continues to navigate a tough consumer lending environment. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 18% versus the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year. Given the impact of the continued challenging economic environment in Europe on the goodwill analysis in the quarter, we recorded an after-tax goodwill impairment of $86 million, which is all of the goodwill related to this business.
As part of the plans to increase value through growth in new markets, we commenced a relationship with MAPFRE, a leading insurer in Latin America, to utilize their distribution to access markets in South America. Wealth Management earnings were $10 million, and the business continues to provide steady earnings and dividends, including dividends of $30 million year-to-date.
Turning to capital. The U.S. Life company's risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 420%, up from the second quarter. RBC benefited from favorable taxes as well as positive statutory income in the quarter. The ratio also reflects the extraordinary $50 million dividend paid to the holding company in the quarter from the Medicare supplement sale.
At the end of the third quarter, unassigned surplus was approximately $180 million and statutory operating income was approximately $590 million year-to-date. We still expect to achieve the 2012 unassigned surplus target of $250 million to $300 million that we laid out in February. These goals were a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our life companies in 2013.
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff Division, results in our Runoff segment improved from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by favorable market conditions.
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio continues to perform well. We have updated the analysis we gave back in our February 3 investor call regarding the impact from the extended low-rate environment on earnings per share. The updated analysis shows an additional impact of $0.01 to $0.02 per share in 2013 and 2014, primarily due to lower projected earnings in Australia related to the rate cuts made throughout 2012.
Let me wrap up so we can take some questions. The last few years have seen several challenges for Genworth. We are now tackling those challenges head on, and we'll put them behind us. We must turn our company around and turn the page to the next stage for Genworth. With our competitive strengths and with our talented team of employees who provide valuable products and services to our customers, we are working to realize the many opportunities that we have to rebuild shareholder value. In doing so, we will build a stronger company which will benefit all of our stakeholders. We are moving quickly and urgently on our action plans and look forward to updating you of our progress.
And now, let's turn it over for questions."

And the stability that we've seen, now a couple of quarters in our results. I think what continues, not so much to change, but to evolve down there, is some of the capital pressure from a regulatory capital standpoint. And basically, the regulator in this environment, as Marty mentioned in his opening remarks, the regulators are cautious in these markets right now. The other thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of is this what's going on in the overall market for IPOs in Australia. There's simply been no material IPOs of any size down in that market this year. And it's why I think there remains some uncertainly in that market regarding the stability to tap into the market from that standpoint. We do remain committed to a partial sale. I think the thing that's most changed for us though, as we think about it is, is we're going to do what it makes the most sense for our shareholders. And in our view, at this point in time, is that our valuations should improve in that market as we move towards the end of the year. Moving performance, subsequent quarters of improving performance will continue to help that, will continue to help the valuation improvement.

We want to make sure that as we have goals for the businesses with respect to the returns, return on equity, particularly as we're writing new business, for example, that we look at that expected ROE when we're pricing and developing products. And we want that to be in excess of the appropriate cost of capital for that particular business line. As you can imagine, different businesses at different risk profiles, different tenures, so obviously, their cost of capital should vary -- our order return on equity should vary along with that. And also, different businesses have different amounts of debt, have different amounts of leverage that they can carry. For example, a stable portfolio, life insurance businesses could really have a leverage of 22% to 25%, maybe 26%. For mortgage insurance platforms, that's a lower type of range. You're looking at probably typically around 15%, maybe as high as 18% and as low as 12%. So you've got different amounts of leverage. So we want to make sure that each of our operating businesses is being running away that can support its specific debt leverage, as well as an appropriate target for it. And then finally, we want to make sure that we're covering all of the expense loads in our pricing, and that there's not any kind of reliance and support from other businesses or from the holding company to do some things that aren't priced in into our products."

For example, with pricing mortgage insurance, we're going to assume that we are able to lever it at 15% number instead of an overall 25% number, which has been what we've been doing. We've been operating at a combined leverage ration of 24% to 26%, which were diversified set of businesses to make things entirely appropriate. But we want to make sure for pricing and those types of returns that we're really looking at the businesses to be priced for their particular debt load that's appropriate. So in case of MI's, for example, we'd be looking to price more of the 15% leverage assumption as opposed to the 24% or 25% leverage assumption. Similarly, we want to look at -- on the other side of the coin, we look at, for example, long-term care returns. And while the overall diversified set of life businesses, you might want to have a cost of capital looking at 11% or 12%. We realize that for long-term care particularly, it's a higher number. It's been a riskier product, but we're working to change that risk profile through underwriting and pricing and product design. But we think long-term care, for example, has a cost of equity that's probably 13% to 15%, maybe even 16%. So we need to make sure that as we're pricing it, that it carries -- or it covers that particular cost of equity. Does that help you?"

I'll provide the extent of the color that I can, given where we are in these discussions with the various stakeholders. I think the way we think about U.S. MI and what we're really trying to drive there is, number one, we're going to continue to write as much of that profitable business as we can under the waivers that have currently been granted to us by our home domiciliary state regulators, as well as the other state regulators across the country. Secondly, we have the additional potential to write business through another subsidiary that we've talked about, our GRMAC subsidiary. And we're only writing in a very narrow handful of states there right now that haven't provided the waivers. So in the next possibility you could do there is just think of that as it's got enough capital in it to write sort of 50-state-type production for about 6 to 12 months. So that's another opportunity. Then you start getting to -- I think, your real question, which is what are some of these other structural alternatives? And I'll just say that we're on ongoing discussions with our regulators, with the GSEs to consider various alternatives that we could -- really when we -- they're really in confidential discussion right now. But as we get closer to the point that we can bring back and talk with you about them, we'll be glad to do that. One example could be an alternate use of the GRMAC entity and doing something with that structurally. So all on track, these are good potential structural alternatives for us. But really, I'd say where we start with is where -- with our current waivers, we're in good shape and be able to continue to write in the places where we're writing. The last thing I'll just add on to that is when we think about some of these new code structures or alternative structures, one of the things they might give us the ability to do is to provide an avenue to bring in some external capital outside of Genworth in the event that that's the alternative that we needed to be able to write the new business, and it wouldn't  be reliant then at that point at our own internal capital."

I'll hit sort of some macro assumptions, as well as just I guess point to some of the trends that we're seeing right now and how we feel about those. Back in -- when we gave sort of our expectation that we had a path to profitability back in February, we said we're going to have a burnout of the 2005 to '08 books. Well, we're seeing that. We thought we're going to have -- and that was all based upon an adequacy of our reserves. We're seeing that. It was based upon -- eventually, the record [ph] performance of the new books of business starting to outweigh the bad books of business, and we're seeing that happen today. The market that we're seeing for mortgage insurance is coming back for us to be able to operate and participate in is in excess of what we had expected back in February at that time. Our share levels are generally holding up, so our -- the combination of that improvement in purchase penetration that's creating the bigger mortgage insurance market, the good pricing we have and the -- and our share performance is helping us. We said we are going to continue to expect loss mitigation benefits at that point. I think we'd see about $300 million and $400 million where we're coming through, and we're going to be exceeding those targets. So we feel good there. When you sort of bring it back all those things and bring them together, we're just on the glide path towards hitting that profitability as we expected back in February. We -- the last thing I think we said at that time is our overall delinquencies and new delinquencies were going to go down about 20%. We're on track. Year-to-date, it's down 23%. So all those trends are heading in the right direction. Getting back to your macro question, we're still expecting, we're going to have -- unemployment is not going to change materially from here on out. We're still going to be operating -- not much help from a growing employment base. Anything that accelerates that right now from the current level could be a good tailwind for us. But we're not expecting any material improvement in unemployment. And in fact, we expect to be sort of elevated throughout 2014. On the peak -- on the HPA basis, we think we sort of troughed and we've hit the bottom at about a total 20% downturn from the high in the FHFA index. And we really expect that to have slow and gradual growth going forward from here, and we're starting to read more about that and hear about it more in the press today as it materializes out there. So just directionally, all our trends are really heading in the right direction. We feel good about it. The new books are about to get to that inflection point when they start to tip over the experience on the old legacy books, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing."

If you just think about our regulatory capital levels that we're holding to, as you saw in the quarter, our MCR levels came down a bit from where they were in the previous quarter.

So one of the things we're working through is rebuilding and building that MCR back up into a level that we think will be more appropriate in that regulatory environment. And so think of that in the low end 40s to a higher maybe 150 MCR-type level. So we're doing that through the continued improvement in our business performance. We're doing it through looking at other ways of managing the capital, perhaps by the usage of some reinsurance. And so you're going to -- we're working through those things with the business right now. They have implications to ultimately the ROE of the business. How much capital you hold is really driving what's the ROE of that business, what's the ROE of that business over a forecasted period of time that you could disclose. When you're doing in some type of public -- some type of IPO-type process, and that all drives valuation. So at the end of the day, it all comes back to valuation.

Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update",3484,"Thanks, Georgette, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.
This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update on the holding company, including our credit rating situation and review third quarter results in our businesses.
In developing a strategy, our highest priority has been to rebuild value for shareholders. Working with the Board of Directors, the management team has developed and begun executing specific plans to both safeguard and maximize the value of the company for shareholders. We intend to accomplish that goal by achieving return in equity in each of our core operating businesses in excess of its related cost of capital, generating significant cash flow to the holding company from core business dividends and realizing value from our non-core businesses and enhancing financial flexibility by: first, managing the core businesses to enable them to be standalone on an operating and debt basis; and second, deleveraging to enhance cash flow, reducing the burden on the holding company and placing the company on better footing with rating indices in the credit markets.
As part of this process, we have identified 2 core sets of businesses: the U.S. Life Insurance businesses, that which include life, long-term care and fixed annuities; and Global Mortgage Insurance, which includes the U.S., Canada, Australia and other markets.
The businesses we have identified as non-core include International Protection, Wealth Management, and of course, the Runoff segment, which includes primarily variable annuities. Each of these 2 core businesses, U.S. Life and Global Mortgage Insurance, has been evaluated on its potential to provide significant competitive advantages, deliver new business returns above its related cost of capital while covering its full expense base and ultimately, produce capital and employable cash that covers the cost of its appropriate share of debt and supports its desired ratings.
Managing our core businesses with these goals will reduce interdependencies and subsidizations among businesses in order to improve financial performance and flexibility. The performance of each of business will be regularly evaluated against this criteria. For example, if a business is not delivering acceptable new business returns, we will evaluate available options to address this issue and ensure it does not continue.
As performance in the core businesses improves, we believe our financial strength and flexibility will improve as well. This flexibility should provide potential opportunities to take additional steps, for example, through the sale or spinoff of businesses if that would further increase shareholder value. Our core businesses have significant opportunities to leverage their strengths to earn attractive returns, given the underserved middle market for life insurance, the growing consumer need for long-term care, the developing U.S. housing market recovery and the continuing development of the housing markets in various international countries.
However, we also recognize that we are operating in an environment with macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory and writing industry challenges. We're also working to overcome underperforming in-force portfolios, a relatively high cost of capital and interdependencies among the individual businesses and with the holding company that impede flexibility.
In each core business, we have 4 key areas of focus: rebalancing the business risk profile, writing profitable new business, improving returns on the in-force portfolio and supporting holding company liquidity and flexibility.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we are working to rebalance the business risk through the partial sale of our Australia MI company and narrow our footprint in Europe given the uncertain economic outlook and increase the use of third-party reinsurance.
In the U.S., Australia and Canada, we are prudently managing our capital and pursuing various ways to utilize that capital in the most efficient and productive way possible.
In Europe, we are writing new mortgage insurance business in only 4 countries where business conditions enable us to achieve attractive returns. We're encouraged by the continued improving trends in U.S. housing market, and we continue to expect that the U.S. Mortgage Insurance business will return to profitability during 2013. We remain focused on executing loss mitigation strategies, maintaining our distribution network and writing profitable new business through waivers, GRMAC or a potential new code-type options. At the same time, we are actively pursuing solutions to reduce linkages with and dependencies on the holding company.
Our businesses in Canada and Australia continue to write profitable new business and deliver dividends to the holding company. While smaller books of new business are utilizing less capital on these platforms, we are working with the regulators as they evaluate capital levels more cautiously in this economic environment.
In our U.S. Life Insurance business, our primary focus is on improving the performance of the in-force business through long-term care in-force price actions, life block transactions and refinancing of life reserves. We're also working to improve the new business profile of both life and long-term care by managing portfolio sales, as well as redesigning products to reduce risk, to improve profitability and to maximize capital efficiency. The goal is to provide regular ordinary dividends to the holding company beginning in 2013.
In our non-core businesses, we will manage new business to enhance the value that can be realized, while generating cash and capital, for example, through an ultimate sale. Our priorities in managing our non-core businesses are as follows: In International Protection, we will maximize the embedded value of the overall business through resizing the current European franchise while continuing to execute on growth opportunities in new markets. We are significantly narrowing the focus in Europe to key relationships and using appropriate pricing to protect margins during the prolonged financial crisis. This will enable us to reduce corresponding infrastructure costs. These changes will add to the embedded value of the business while maintaining significant dividends to the holding company, enhancing our ability to realize increased value from a potential sale of the business in the next 2 to 3 years and as economic and business conditions permit.
Wealth Management is an attractive business with a strong competitive position and continuing growth potential, and we believe it can also be a significant source of capital. We continue to invest in investment solutions and new capabilities to support the financial advisers we serve and to increase the value of the business. We will also be evaluating opportunities to ultimately realize that value at the appropriate time.
All of these actions support our goals of building strength and flexibility at the holding company. We are positioning our core businesses to pay consistent dividends while generating cash and capital from our non-core businesses. While our current leverage ratio of 25% is appropriate for a diversified set of businesses, we are moving to a medium-term leverage target of 20% to 22%. This reduced leverage target is more appropriate for the core businesses on a standalone basis and will increase our financial and strategic flexibility and should also benefit our ratings over time.
As additional capital is generated, we will evaluate how best to deploy it. These options include: first, strengthening the balance sheets and performance of our businesses, where appropriate; second, reducing leverage to increase flexibility; and third, returning capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases. These options will be viewed through the lens of how best to increase shareholder value at the time.
Successful execution of this turnaround strategy should increase the earnings and ROE in our core insurance businesses while also generating cash and capital that will increase financial strength and flexibility. I should also note that the Board continues to be actively engaged in the CEO search process, working with Russell Reynolds, and has made good progress.
Let me now cover some topics of the holding company. We continue to generate and to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, cash and liquid securities at the holding company totaled about $1.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, we will payout approximately $375 million to the operating companies related to tax-sharing agreements with them. This includes the $230 million of temporary tax benefits being held at the holding company which we noted last quarter.
After reflecting those upcoming payments, the holding company has about $1 billion in cash and liquid securities, in line with our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend sources to the holding company over the next 18 months. We expect the year-end cash balance to also be in line with that target.
Regarding dividends to the holding company, the Insurance and Wealth Management Division remains on track with the 2012 goal of $300 million, having paid $236 million through the end of the third quarter.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we continue to expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012, with $30 million paid year-to-date from the Canada ordinary dividend.
Also, the company signed an agreement this month to sell its home equity access business for $22 million. This transaction is expected to close in early 2013 with no significant gain or loss from the sale impacting corporate or other activities.
Now I'd like to touch on the actions of the rating agencies during the quarter. First in our view, Moody's recent decision to extend the review of our holding company and of the U.S. Mortgage Insurance recognizes the plans that we have developed to increase our financial strength and flexibility. While S&P also acknowledge this, we were disappointed that they chose to take ratings actions before we had made further progress in our plans. We believe that as we execute our strategic plan, our financial strength and flexibility will improve, which should stabilize and ultimately improve our ratings. However, in the meantime, we took steps to prepare for potentially adverse ratings actions. We do not believe the downgrade by S&P or the potential action by Moody's will have a material impact from a commercial liquidity or financial perspective.
From a commercial perspective, there has been no significant change in the ability to write new business or on the capacity or willingness of counter-parties to enter into hedging transactions. The holding company does not have any long-term debt maturities until June of 2014 when $600 million of long-term debt matures. We plan to address this debt well in advance of its maturity date.
Along with the strategic plan discussed earlier, we continue to work with regulators and rating agencies to develop comprehensive solutions for U.S. MI. We are seeking to address rating agency concerns and fulfill our commitment to pay all our valid claims, while safeguarding the liquidity, capital and shareholder value of Genworth by: first, increasing financial flexibility for Genworth and U.S. MI by reducing U.S. MI's dependency on the holding company; second, preserving the holding company liquidity buffers and other liquid assets; and third, sustaining U.S. MI's access to profitable NIW markets.
Alternatives under consideration include internal reorganizations and potential new cost structures. These alternatives could require some form of capital contribution, none of which is expected to be material to holding company target liquidity or buffers. These alternatives also do not rely on our capital generation plans, nor do they rely on additional contribution of mixed shares. We believe that a runoff, spinoff or sale of U.S. MI or the amendment of our bond indentures are not the most beneficial options for shareholders at this time. We will provide updates as we move forward further on these plans.
Now let's turn to third quarter results, where we reported operating income of $121 million for the quarter and net income of $34 million, which reflects the goodwill writeoff in the International Protection. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we saw continued progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $56 million compared to income of $51 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, stronger results in Australia as the performance in the portfolio continues to improve and consistent performance in the U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $57 million. Unemployment was stable and home prices were up slightly from some continued regional variation. Lower interest rates have improved affordability and consumer sentiment. The loss ratio for the quarter was 47%, which is down 7 points sequentially.
Overall delinquencies were down 10%, with new delinquencies in cures improving across all major states. While paid claims are elevated, reserves remain largely in line with the trends we had anticipated following the first quarter reserve strengthening. We continue to manage capital against the backdrop of increasing regulatory capital expectations given the uncertain global environment. We were evaluating additional reinsurance treaties to manage the capital levels, while balancing the increased cost on an impact on overall returns.
Executing a partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk and generating capital. While the performance of the business is recovering, the increasing regulatory capital expectations and uncertain market conditions on Australia for initial public offering can impact both valuation and timing. We remain committed to a partial sale, but given our liquidity at the holding company and the other leverage that we have to generate cash and capital, we'll execute a transaction when it makes the most sense for shareholders.
Execution of an IPO is subject to market valuation and regulatory considerations, and we do not now expect an IPO to occur prior to late 2013.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, unemployment was stable sequentially and home prices were down slightly. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 30%, as overall delinquencies were down 9% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues, and the changes to eligibility rules for government guarantee mortgages that went into effect in July of this year are likely to reduce the size of the high loan-to-value mortgage insurance market. Our capital position remains solid in Canada.
The operating loss of other countries in the international mortgage segment improved somewhat to $5 million sequentially, driven by a reduction in losses, primarily in Ireland.
Moving now to U.S. MI. We had a net operating loss of $38 million in the quarter, effectively flat sequentially after adjusting for a $12 million benefit from the termination of an external reinsurance contract in the second quarter. We're seeing a slow recovery in the housing market, and the mortgage insurance market is improving. And we have seen strong growth, driven by a larger mortgage origination market and higher mortgage insurance purchase penetration in the quarter, the highest since 2008.
Total losses were flat sequentially, as a seasonal increase in new delinquencies and lower self-cure activity was offset by loss mitigation and modest changes in aging.
Our total flow delinquencies fell by 19% from the prior year, with new delinquencies up 5% sequentially from seasonality, but down 24% year-over-year, reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 to 2008 books and the new better performing books becoming a larger portion of our overall portfolio.
With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk-to-capital ratios above 25:1 in GEMICO. 
Finally, during the quarter, the GSEs granted GRMAC an extension of the ability to write new business in non-waiver states through 2013. Considering these improving macroeconomic fundamentals, the continuation of government programs, loan modifications, the continued burn-through of the unprofitable books of business and a growth of new books with a 20% plus ROE, we expect U.S. MI to return to profitability during 2013.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management Division, reported operating earnings were $104 million. Life Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter. We saw higher term life mortality experience in the quarter, which is the third straight elevated quarter after 3 quarters of more favorable experience when compared to pricing assumptions. Fluctuations in mortality can occur, but we have not identified any systemic trends.
Life Insurance sales were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with the pricing and product actions taken this year as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect to complete our second life block transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012. The initial phases of the transaction began in the third quarter, and we recorded an associated GAAP loss of $6 million this quarter. We expect the capital benefit to be in excess of $100 million in the fourth quarter when the transaction is completed.
On October 22, we announced changes to our Life Insurance portfolio, designed to update our product offerings and further adjust pricing to reflect the current low interest rate environment and regulatory changes. Under the new AG 38 guidelines, we have determined that approximately 7% of our universal life insurance reserves are subject to the new regulations, which require additional reserve adequacy testing. While our analysis is not yet complete, we do not expect a significant financial impact related to the new reserving requirements on our in-force reserves subject to the new guidance.
Long-term care earnings were up for the quarter at $45 million. We had $29 million of favorable reserve adjustments impacting results for both active life and disabled life reserves, primarily as a result of the continued multistage system conversion. As of the end of the third quarter, reserves for both GAAP and Stat are adequate.
After adjusting for the reserve items, the loss ratio was approximately 74%, which is flat to the prior quarter. Our previously announced 18% premium rate increase on the majority of the older-issued policies continues to take effect. With respect to the recently initiated in-force price actions, through October 26, we have met with 20 states and recently submitted filings in 18 states. We also have approval from 2 states to begin implementation in the fourth quarter of this year.
Fixed annuity earnings were $19 million, and sales in this line were up from the second quarter even as we continue to take actions to maintain margins. International Protection earnings were $8 million for the quarter. The business continues to navigate the tough consumer lending environment. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 18% versus the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year. Given the impact of the continued challenging economic environment in Europe on the goodwill analysis in the quarter, we recorded an after-tax goodwill impairment of $86 million, which was all of the goodwill related to this business.
As part of the plans to increase value through growth in new markets, we commenced a relationship with MAPFRE, a leading insurer in Latin America, to utilize their distribution to access markets in South America. Wealth Management earnings were $10 million, and the business continues to provide steady earnings and dividends, including dividends of $30 million year-to-date.
Turning to capital. The U.S. Life company's risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 420%, up from the second quarter. RBC benefited from favorable taxes as well as positive statutory income in the quarter. The ratio also reflects the extraordinary $50 million dividend paid to the holding company in the quarter from the Medicare supplement sale.
At the end of the third quarter, unassigned surplus was approximately $180 million and statutory operating income was approximately $590 million year-to-date. We still expect to achieve the 2012 unassigned surplus target of $250 million to $300 million that we laid out in February. These goals were a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our life companies in 2013.
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff Division, results in our Runoff segment improved from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by favorable market conditions.
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio continues to perform well. We have updated the analysis we gave back in our February 3 investor call regarding the impact from an extended low-rate environment on earnings per share. The updated analysis shows an additional impact of $0.01 to $0.02 per share in 2013 and 2014, primarily due to lower projected earnings in Australia related to the rate cuts made throughout 2012.
Let me wrap up so we can take some questions. The last few years have seen several challenges for Genworth. We are now tackling those challenges head on, and we'll put them behind us. We must turn our company around and turn the page to the next stage for Genworth. With our competitive strengths and with our talented team of employees who provide valuable products and services to our customers, we are working to realize the many opportunities that we have to rebuild shareholder value. In doing so, we will build a stronger company which will benefit all of our stakeholders. We are moving quickly and urgently on our action plans and look forward to updating you of our progress.
And now, let's turn it over for questions."

And the stability that we've seen, now a couple of quarters in our results. I think what continues, not so much to change, but to evolve down there, is some of the capital pressure from a regulatory capital standpoint. And basically, the regulator in this environment, as Marty mentioned in his opening remarks, the regulators are cautious in these markets right now. The other thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of is just what's going on in the overall market for IPOs in Australia. There's simply been no material IPOs of any size down in that market this year. And that's why I think there remains some uncertainly in that market regarding the stability to tap into the market from that standpoint. We do remain committed to a partial sale. I think the thing that's most changed for us though, as we think about it is, is we're going to do what it makes the most sense for our shareholders. And in our view, at this point in time, is that our valuations should improve in that market as we move towards the end of the year.

Other components of the reserve decreased because we found that the reserves were redundant. So the first thing that's important there is in that component of the changes, we found that our reserves were approximately right in aggregate, and our total claims reserve was sufficient. So it didn't change materially. We did have about $15 billion of active life reserves we're holding on that business a set of minor adjustments, which resulted in a favorable impact to earnings of $29 million after tax. And we do not expect a material impact since the remaining work is completed. We also did some work updating our GAAP loss recognition testing and our staff reserve adequacy analysis.

We do think it's very important as we improve our business performance, as well as our financial flexibility that we manage the businesses on that kind of standalone basis that we talked about.

We want to make sure that as we have goals for the businesses with respect to the returns, return on equity, particularly as we're writing new business, for example, that we look at that expected ROE when we're pricing and developing products. And we want that to be in excess of the appropriate cost of capital for that particular business line. As you can imagine, different businesses have different risk profiles, different tenures, so obviously, their cost of capital should vary -- or rather, their return on equity should vary along with that. And also, different businesses have different amounts of debt, or different amounts of leverage that they can carry. For example, a stable portfolio, life insurance businesses could really have a leverage of 22% to 25%, maybe 26%. For mortgage insurance platforms, that's a lower type of range. You're looking at probably typically around 15%, maybe as high as 18% and as low as 12%. So you've got different amounts of leverage. So we want to make sure that each of our operating businesses is being run in a way that can support its specific debt leverage, as well as an appropriate target for it. And then finally, we want to make sure that we're covering all of the expense loads in our pricing, and that there's not any kind of reliance and support from other businesses or from the holding company to do some things that aren't priced in, into our products."

For example, as we're pricing mortgage insurance, we're going to assume that we are able to lever it at 15% number instead of an overall 25% number, which has been what we've been doing. We've been operating at a combined leverage ratio of 24% to 26%, which for a diversified set of businesses, we think is entirely appropriate. But we want to make sure for pricing and those types of returns that we're really looking at the businesses to be priced for their particular debt load that's appropriate. So in case of MI's, for example, we'd be looking to price more of the 15% leverage assumption as opposed to the 24% or 25% leverage assumption. Similarly, we want to look at -- on the other side of the coin, we look at, for example, long-term care returns. And while the overall diversified set of life businesses, you might want to have a cost of capital looking at 11% or 12%. We realize that for long-term care particularly, it's a higher number. It's been a riskier product, but we're working to change that risk profile through underwriting and pricing and product design. But we think long-term care, for example, has a cost of equity that's probably 13% to 15%, maybe even 16%. So we need to make sure that as we're pricing it, that it carries -- or it covers that particular cost of equity. Does that help you?"

I'll provide the extent of the color that I can, given where we are in these discussions with the various stakeholders. I think the way we think about U.S. MI and what we're really trying to drive there is, number one, we're going to continue to write as much of that profitable business as we can under the waivers that have currently been granted to us by our home domiciliary state regulators, as well as the other state regulators across the country. Secondly, we have the additional potential to write business through another subsidiary that we've talked about, our GRMAC subsidiary. And we're only writing in a very narrow handful of states there right now that haven't provided the waivers. So in the next possibility you could do there is just think of that as it's got enough capital in it to write sort of 50-state-type production for about 6 to 12 months. So that's another opportunity. Then you start getting to -- I think, your real question, which is what are some of these other structural alternatives? And I'll just say that we're on ongoing discussions with our regulators, with the GSEs to consider various alternatives that we could -- really when we -- they're really in confidential in discussion right now. But as we get closer to the point that we can bring back and talk with you about them, we'll be glad to do that. One example could be an alternate use of the GRMAC entity and doing something with that structurally. So all on track, these are good potential structural alternatives for us. But really, I'd say where we start with is where -- with our current waivers, we're in good shape and be able to continue to write in the places where we were writing. The last thing I'll just add on to that is when we think about some of these new code structures or alternative structures, one of the things they might give us the ability to do is to prevent an avenue to bring in some external capital outside of Genworth in the event that, that's the alternative that we needed to be able to write the new business, and it wouldn't  be reliant then at that point at our own internal capital."

I'll hit sort of some macro assumptions, as well as just I guess point to some of the trends that we're seeing right now and how we feel about those. Back in -- when we gave sort of our expectation that we had a path to profitability back in February, we said we're going to have a burnout of the 2005 to '08 books. Well, we're seeing that. We thought we're going to have -- and that was all based upon an adequacy of our reserves. We're seeing that. It was based upon -- eventually, the referent [ph] performance of the new books of business starting to outweigh the bad books of business, and we're seeing that happen today. The market that we're seeing for mortgage insurance is coming back for us to be able to operate and participate in is in excess of what we had expected back in February at that time. Our share levels are generally holding up, so our -- the combination of that improvement in purchase penetration that's creating the bigger mortgage insurance market, the good pricing we have and the -- and our share performance is helping us. We said we were going to continue to expect loss mitigation benefits at that point. I think we'd see about $300 million and $400 million where we're coming through, and we're going to be exceeding those targets. So we feel good there. When you sort of bring it back all those things and bring them together, we're just on the glide path towards hitting that profitability as we expected back in February. We -- the last thing I think we said at that time is our overall delinquencies and new delinquencies were going to go down about 20%. We're on track. Year-to-date, it's down 23%. So all those trends are heading in the right direction. Getting back to your macro question, we're still expecting, we're going to have -- unemployment is not going to change materially from here on out. We're still going to be operating -- not much help from the growing employment base. Anything that accelerates that right now from the current level could be a good tailwind for us. But we're not expecting any material improvement in unemployment. And in fact, we expect to be sort of elevated throughout 2014. On the peak -- on the HPA basis, we think we've sort of troughed and we've hit the bottom at about a total 20% downturn from the high in the FHFA index. And we really expect that to have slow and gradual growth going forward from here, and we're starting to read more about that and hear about it more in the press today as it materializes out there. So just directionally, all our trends are really heading in the right direction. We feel good about it. The new books are about to get to that inflection point when they start to tip over the experience on the old legacy books, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing."

If you just think about our regulatory capital levels that we're holding to, as you saw in the quarter, our MCR levels came down a bit from where they were in the previous quarter. We had told you that, that was going to happen after our second quarter call, largely the result of the elimination of some reinsurance, affiliate reinsurance that we had in the system that was being provided by the U.S. MI business. So one of the things we're working through is rebuilding and building that MCR back up into a level that we think will be more appropriate in that regulatory environment. And so think of that in the low end 40s to a higher maybe 150 MCR-type level. So we're doing that through the continued improvement in our business performance. We're doing it through looking at other ways of managing the capital, perhaps by the usage of some reinsurance. And so you got to -- we're working through those things with the business right now. They have implications to ultimately the ROE of the business. How much capital you hold is really driving what's the ROE of that business, what's the ROE of that business over a forecasted period of time that you could disclose. When you're doing in some type of public -- some type of IPO-type process, and that all drives valuation. So at the end of the day, it all comes back to valuation. And we just think, as I mentioned earlier, that those valuations will improve as we get deeper into 2013, allowing us to hit a higher valuation and deliver more value to our shareholders."

With respect to the existing business, I really think that the path to building value is proceeding with the announced rate increases and rating changes, particularly on the older book. Because if you were to look at the reinsurance support, it potentially would be a lot better after we complete those re-rating processes rather than before. So while right now, our existing business plan is looking at the re-rating processes as the means of mitigating the losses on the older book and thereby, improving profitability of the book overall. As we finish that, we will, of course, look at reinsurance markets and support and how we're using capital to support that business and as well how to produce the best valuation of the business over time for shareholders."

So we did take a close look at our emerging yields. They're actually consistent with prior periods. So while there is exposure to low interest rates, we haven't really seen that impacting our core yields to date. We did make some changes in assumptions, making the projected interest rates for reserving purposes more conservative, and that's what resulted in the change.

Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update",3484,"Thanks, Georgette, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to say that we wish the best for all the people who are dealing with the aftermath of Sandy.
This morning, we'll provide an overview of our corporate strategy, give an update on the holding company, including our credit rating situation and review third quarter results in our businesses.
In developing a strategy, our highest priority has been to rebuild value for shareholders. Working with the Board of Directors, the management team has developed and begun executing specific plans to both safeguard and maximize the value of the company for shareholders. We intend to accomplish that goal by achieving return in equity in each of our core operating businesses in excess of its related cost of capital, generating significant cash flow to the holding company from core business dividends and realizing value from our non-core businesses and enhancing financial flexibility by: first, managing the core businesses to enable them to be standalone on an operating and debt basis; and second, deleveraging to enhance cash flow, reducing the burden on the holding company and placing the company on better footing with rating indices in the credit markets.
As part of this process, we have identified 2 core sets of businesses: the U.S. Life Insurance businesses, that which include life, long-term care and fixed annuities; and Global Mortgage Insurance, which includes the U.S., Canada, Australia and other markets.
The businesses we have identified as non-core include International Protection, Wealth Management, and of course, the Runoff segment, which includes primarily variable annuities. Each of these 2 core businesses, U.S. Life and Global Mortgage Insurance, has been evaluated on its potential to provide significant competitive advantages, deliver new business returns above its related cost of capital while covering its full expense base and ultimately, produce capital and employable cash that covers the cost of its appropriate share of debt and supports its desired ratings.
Managing our core businesses with these goals will reduce interdependencies and subsidizations among businesses in order to improve financial performance and flexibility. The performance of each of business will be regularly evaluated against these criteria. For example, if a business is not delivering acceptable new business returns, we will evaluate available options to address this issue and ensure it does not continue.
As performance in the core businesses improves, we believe our financial strength and flexibility will improve as well. This flexibility should provide potential opportunities to take additional steps, for example, through the sale or spinoff of businesses if that would further increase shareholder value. Our core businesses have significant opportunities to leverage their strengths to earn attractive returns, given the underserved middle market for life insurance, the growing consumer need for long-term care, the developing U.S. housing market recovery and the continuing development of the housing markets in various international countries.
However, we also recognize that we are operating in an environment with macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory and writing industry challenges. We're also working to overcome underperforming in-force portfolios, a relatively high cost of capital and interdependencies among the individual businesses and with the holding company that impede flexibility.
In each core business, we have 4 key areas of focus: rebalancing the business risk profile, writing profitable new business, improving returns on the in-force portfolio and supporting holding company liquidity and flexibility.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we are working to rebalance the business risk through the partial sale of our Australia MI company and narrow our footprint in Europe given the uncertain economic outlook and increase the use of third-party reinsurance.
In the U.S., Australia and Canada, we are prudently managing our capital and pursuing various ways to utilize that capital in the most efficient and productive way possible.
In Europe, we are writing new mortgage insurance business in only 4 countries where business conditions enable us to achieve attractive returns. We're encouraged by the continued improving trends in U.S. housing market, and we continue to expect that the U.S. Mortgage Insurance business will return to profitability during 2013. We remain focused on executing loss mitigation strategies, maintaining our distribution network and writing profitable new business through waivers, GRMAC or a potential new code-type options. At the same time, we are actively pursuing solutions to reduce linkages with and dependencies on the holding company.
Our businesses in Canada and Australia continue to write profitable new business and deliver dividends to the holding company. While smaller books of new business are utilizing less capital on these platforms, we are working with the regulators as they evaluate capital levels more cautiously in this economic environment.
In our U.S. Life Insurance business, our primary focus is on improving the performance of the in-force business through long-term care in-force price actions, life block transactions and refinancing of life reserves. We're also working to improve the new business profile of both life and long-term care by managing portfolio sales, as well as redesigning products to reduce risk, to improve profitability and to maximize capital efficiency. The goal is to provide regular ordinary dividends to the holding company beginning in 2013.
In our non-core businesses, we will manage new business to enhance the value that can be realized, while generating cash and capital, for example, through an ultimate sale. Our priorities in managing our non-core businesses are as follows: In International Protection, we will maximize the embedded value of the overall business through resizing the current European franchise while continuing to execute on growth opportunities in new markets. We are significantly narrowing the focus in Europe to key relationships and using appropriate pricing to protect margins during the prolonged financial crisis. This will enable us to reduce corresponding infrastructure costs. These changes will add to the embedded value of the business while maintaining significant dividends to the holding company, enhancing our ability to realize increased value from a potential sale of the business in the next 2 to 3 years and as economic and business conditions permit.
Wealth Management is an attractive business with a strong competitive position and continuing growth potential, and we believe it can also be a significant source of capital. We continue to invest in investment solutions and new capabilities to support the financial advisers we serve and to increase the value of the business. We will also be evaluating opportunities to ultimately realize that value at the appropriate time.
All of these actions support our goals of building strength and flexibility at the holding company. We are positioning our core businesses to pay consistent dividends while generating cash and capital from our non-core businesses. While our current leverage ratio of 25% is appropriate for a diversified set of businesses, we are moving to a medium-term leverage target of 20% to 22%. This reduced leverage target is more appropriate for the core businesses on a standalone basis and will increase our financial and strategic flexibility and should also benefit our ratings over time.
As additional capital is generated, we will evaluate how best to deploy it. These options include: first, strengthening the balance sheets and performance of our businesses, where appropriate; second, reducing leverage to increase flexibility; and third, returning capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases. These options will be viewed through the lens of how best to increase shareholder value at the time.
Successful execution of this turnaround strategy should increase the earnings and ROE in our core insurance businesses while also generating cash and capital that will increase financial strength and flexibility. I should also note that the board continues to be actively engaged in the CEO search process, working with Russell Reynolds, and has made good progress.
Let me now cover some topics of the holding company. We continue to generate and to maintain significant liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, cash and liquid securities at the holding company totaled about $1.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, we will payout approximately $375 million to the operating companies related to tax-sharing agreements with them. This includes the $230 million of temporary tax benefits being held at the holding company which we noted last quarter.
After reflecting those upcoming payments, the holding company has about $1 billion in cash and liquid securities, in line with our target of 2x debt service coverage, which is about $600 million, as well as an additional buffer of approximately $350 million for stress scenarios that might impact the dividend sources to the holding company over the next 18 months. We expect the year-end cash balance to also be in line with that target.
Regarding dividends to the holding company, the Insurance and Wealth Management Division remains on track with the 2012 goal of $300 million, having paid $236 million through the end of the third quarter.
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we continue to expect dividends from the international mortgage platforms in the range of $50 million to $110 million for 2012, with $30 million paid year-to-date from the Canada ordinary dividend.
Also, the company signed an agreement this month to sell its home equity access business for $22 million. This transaction is expected to close in early 2013 with no significant gain or loss from the sale impacting corporate or other activities.
Now I'd like to touch on the actions of the rating agencies during the quarter. First in our view, Moody's recent decision to extend the review of our holding company and of the U.S. Mortgage Insurance recognizes the plans that we have developed to increase our financial strength and flexibility. While S&P also acknowledge this, we were disappointed that they chose to take ratings actions before we had made further progress in our plans. We believe that as we execute our strategic plan, our financial strength and flexibility will improve which should stabilize and ultimately improve our ratings. However, in the meantime, we took steps to prepare for potentially adverse ratings actions. We do not believe the downgrade by S&P or the potential action by Moody's will have a material impact from a commercial liquidity or financial perspective.
From a commercial perspective, there has been no significant change in the ability to write new business or on the capacity or willingness of counter-parties to enter into hedging transactions. The holding company does not have any long-term debt maturities until June of 2014 when $600 million of long-term debt matures. We plan to address this debt well in advance of its maturity date.
Along with the strategic plan discussed earlier, we continue to work with regulators and rating agencies to develop comprehensive solutions for U.S. MI. We are seeking to address rating agency concerns and fulfill our commitment to pay all our valid claims, while safeguarding the liquidity, capital and shareholder value of Genworth by: first, increasing financial flexibility for Genworth and U.S. MI by reducing U.S. MI's dependency on the holding company; second, preserving the holding company liquidity buffers and other liquid assets; and third, sustaining U.S. MI's access to profitable NIW markets.
Alternatives under consideration include internal reorganizations and potential new cost structures. These alternatives could require some form of capital contribution, none of which is expected to be material to holding company target liquidity or buffers. These alternatives also do not rely on our capital generation plans, nor do they rely on additional contribution of mixed shares. We believe that a runoff, spinoff or sale of U.S. MI or the amendment of our bond indentures are not the most beneficial options for shareholders at this time. We will provide updates as we move forward further on these plans.
Now let's turn to third quarter results, where we reported operating income of $121 million for the quarter and net income of $34 million, which reflects the goodwill write-off in the International Protection. 
In Global Mortgage Insurance, we saw continued progress in the division, with reported net operating income of $56 million compared to income of $51 million in the prior quarter. There was stable performance in Canada, stronger results in Australia as the performance in the portfolio continues to improve and consistent performance in the U.S. Mortgage Insurance. 
In Australia, operating earnings were $57 million. Unemployment was stable and home prices were up slightly from some continued regional variation. Lower interest rates have improved affordability and consumer sentiment. The loss ratio for the quarter was 47%, which is down 7 points sequentially.
Overall delinquencies were down 10%, with new delinquencies in cures improving across all major states. While paid claims are elevated, reserves remain largely in line with the trends we had anticipated following the first quarter reserve strengthening. We continue to manage capital against the backdrop of increasing regulatory capital expectations given the uncertain global environment. We were evaluating additional reinsurance treaties to manage the capital levels, while balancing the increased cost on an impact on overall returns.
Executing a partial sale of our Australia MI platform remains a key goal in reducing our exposure to mortgage insurance risk and generating capital. While the performance of the business is recovering, the increasing regulatory capital expectations and uncertain market conditions on Australia for initial public offering can impact both valuation and timing. We remain committed to a partial sale, but given our liquidity at the holding company and the other leverage that we have to generate cash and capital, we'll execute a transaction when it makes the most sense for shareholders. Execution of an IPO is subject to market valuation and regulatory considerations, and we do not now expect an IPO to occur prior to late 2013.
Turning to Canada, operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, unemployment was stable sequentially and home prices were down slightly. The loss ratio decreased to 2 points sequentially to 30%, as overall delinquencies were down 9% from the prior quarter. Improvement in the Alberta region continues, and the changes to eligibility rules for government guarantee mortgages that went into effect in July of this year are likely to reduce the size of the high loan-to-value mortgage insurance market. Our capital position remains solid in Canada.
The operating loss of other countries in the international mortgage segment improved somewhat to $5 million sequentially, driven by a reduction in losses, primarily in Ireland.
Moving now to U.S. MI. We had a net operating loss of $38 million in the quarter, effectively flat sequentially after adjusting for a $12 million benefit from the termination of an external reinsurance contract in the second quarter. We're seeing a slow recovery in the housing market, and the mortgage insurance market is improving. And we have seen strong growth, driven by a larger mortgage origination market and higher mortgage insurance purchase penetration in the quarter, the highest since 2008.
Total losses were flat sequentially, as a seasonal increase in new delinquencies and lower self-cure activity was offset by loss mitigation and modest changes in aging.
Our total flow delinquencies fell by 19% from the prior year, with new delinquencies up 5% sequentially from seasonality, but down 24% year-over-year, reflecting the continued burn-through of the 2005 to 2008 books and the new better performing books becoming a larger portion of our overall portfolio.
With the extension of the waivers, we anticipate continuing to write new business with risk-to-capital ratios above 25:1 in GEMICO. 
Finally, during the quarter, the GSEs granted GRMAC an extension of the ability to write new business in non-waiver states through 2013. Considering these improving macroeconomic fundamentals, the continuation of government programs, loan modifications, the continued burn-through of the unprofitable books of business and a growth of new books with a 20% plus ROE, we expect U.S. MI to return to profitability during 2013.
Moving to the Insurance and Wealth Management Division, reported operating earnings were $104 million. Life Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter. We saw higher term life mortality experience in the quarter, which is the third straight elevated quarter after 3 quarters of more favorable experience when compared to pricing assumptions. Fluctuations in mortality can occur, but we have not identified any systemic trends.
Life Insurance sales were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with the pricing and product actions taken this year as we managed sales volume and improved statutory performance. We expect to complete our second life block transaction in the fourth quarter of 2012. The initial phases of the transaction began in the third quarter, and we recorded an associated GAAP loss of $6 million this quarter. We expect the capital benefit to be in excess of $100 million in the fourth quarter when the transaction is completed.
On October 22, we announced changes to our Life Insurance portfolio, designed to update our product offerings and further adjust pricing to reflect the current low interest rate environment and regulatory changes. Under the new AG 38 guidelines, we have determined that approximately 7% of our universal life insurance reserves are subject to the new regulations, which require additional reserve adequacy testing. While our analysis is not yet complete, we do not expect a significant financial impact related to the new reserving requirements on our in-force reserves subject to the new guidance.
Long-term care earnings were up for the quarter at $45 million. We had $29 million of favorable reserve adjustments impacting results for both active life and disabled life reserves, primarily as a result of the continued multistage system conversion. As of the end of the third quarter, reserves for both GAAP and Stat are adequate.
After adjusting for the reserve items, the loss ratio was approximately 74%, which is flat to the prior quarter. Our previously announced 18% premium rate increase on the majority of the older-issued policies continues to take effect. With respect to the recently initiated in-force price actions, through October 26, we have met with 20 states and recently submitted filings in 18 states. We also have approval from 2 states to begin implementation in the fourth quarter of this year.
Fixed annuity earnings were $19 million, and sales in this line were up from the second quarter even as we continue to take actions to maintain margins. International Protection earnings were $8 million for the quarter. The business continues to navigate the tough consumer lending environment. New claim registrations in Europe decreased 18% versus the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year. Given the impact of the continued challenging economic environment in Europe on the goodwill analysis in the quarter, we recorded an after-tax goodwill impairment of $86 million, which was all of the goodwill related to this business.
As part of the plans to increase value through growth in new markets, we commenced a relationship with MAPFRE, a leading insurer in Latin America, to utilize their distribution to access markets in South America. Wealth Management earnings were $10 million and the business continues to provide steady earnings and dividends, including dividends of $30 million year-to-date.
Turning to capital. The U.S. Life company's risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be about 420%, up from the second quarter. RBC benefited from favorable taxes as well as positive statutory income in the quarter. The ratio also reflects the extraordinary $50 million dividend paid to the holding company in the quarter from the Medicare supplement sale.
At the end of the third quarter, unassigned surplus was approximately $180 million and statutory operating income was approximately $590 million year-to-date. We still expect to achieve the 2012 unassigned surplus target of $250 million to $300 million that we laid out in February. These goals were a high priority as we work to reestablish the regular ordinary dividend capacity of our life companies in 2013.
Finally, in the Corporate and Runoff Division, results in our Runoff segment improved from the prior quarter and the prior year from variable annuity results, driven by favorable market conditions.
Shifting to investments, the global portfolio continues to perform well. We have updated the analysis we gave back in our February 3 investor call regarding the impact from an extended low-rate environment on earnings per share. The updated analysis shows an additional impact of $0.01 to $0.02 per share in 2013 and 2014, primarily due to lower projected earnings in Australia related to the rate cuts made throughout 2012.
Let me wrap up so we can take some questions. The last few years have seen several challenges for Genworth. We are now tackling those challenges head on, and we'll put them behind us. We must turn our company around and turn the page to the next stage for Genworth. With our competitive strengths and with our talented team of employees who provide valuable products and services to our customers, we are working to realize the many opportunities that we have to rebuild shareholder value. In doing so, we will build a stronger company which will benefit all of our stakeholders. We are moving quickly and urgently on our action plans and look forward to updating you of our progress.
And now, let's turn it over for questions."

And the stability that we've seen, now a couple of quarters in our results. I think what continues, not so much to change, but to evolve down there, is some of the capital pressure from a regulatory capital standpoint. And basically, the regulator in this environment, as Marty mentioned in his opening remarks, the regulators are cautious in these markets right now. The other thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of is just what's going on in the overall market for IPOs in Australia. There's simply been no material IPOs of any size down in that market this year. And that's why I think there remains some uncertainly in that market regarding the stability to tap into the market from that standpoint. We do remain committed to a partial sale. I think the thing that's most changed for us though, as we think about it is, is we're going to do what it makes the most sense for our shareholders. And in our view, at this point in time, is that our valuations should improve in that market as we move towards the end of the year. Moving performance, subsequent quarters of improving performance will continue to help that, will continue to help the valuation improvement. And again, that's one we're targeting at this point because we think it will be the one that will generate the best outcome for our shareholders."

We want to make sure that as we have goals for the businesses with respect to the returns, return on equity, particularly as we're writing new business, for example, that we look at that expected ROE when we're pricing and developing products. And we want that to be in excess of the appropriate cost of capital for that particular business line. As you can imagine, different businesses have different risk profiles, different tenures, so obviously, their cost of capital should vary -- or rather, their return on equity should vary along with that. And also, different businesses have different amounts of debt, or different amounts of leverage that they can carry. For example, a stable portfolio, life insurance businesses could really have a leverage of 22% to 25%, maybe 26%. For mortgage insurance platforms, that's a lower type of range. You're looking at probably typically around 15%, maybe as high as 18% and as low as 12%. So you've got different amounts of leverage. So we want to make sure that each of our operating businesses is being run in a way that can support its specific debt leverage, as well as an appropriate target for it. And then finally, we want to make sure that we're covering all of the expense loads in our pricing, and that there's not any kind of reliance and support from other businesses or from the holding company to do some things that aren't priced in, into our products."

For example, as we're pricing mortgage insurance, we're going to assume that we are able to lever it at 15% number instead of an overall 25% number, which has been what we've been doing. We've been operating at a combined leverage ratio of 24% to 26%, which for a diversified set of businesses, we think is entirely appropriate. But we want to make sure for pricing and those types of returns that we're really looking at the businesses to be priced for their particular debt load that's appropriate. So in case of MI's, for example, we'd be looking to price more of the 15% leverage assumption as opposed to the 24% or 25% leverage assumption. Similarly, we want to look at -- on the other side of the coin, we look at, for example, long-term care returns. And while the overall diversified set of life businesses, you might want to have a cost of capital looking at 11% or 12%. We realize that for long-term care particularly, it's a higher number. It's been a riskier product, but we're working to change that risk profile through underwriting and pricing and product design. But we think long-term care, for example, has a cost of equity that's probably 13% to 15%, maybe even 16%. So we need to make sure that as we're pricing it, that it carries -- or it covers that particular cost of equity. Does that help you?"

I'll provide the extent of the color that I can, given where we are in these discussions with the various stakeholders. I think the way we think about U.S. MI and what we're really trying to drive there is, number one, we're going to continue to write as much of that profitable business as we can under the waivers that have currently been granted to us by our home domiciliary state regulators, as well as the other state regulators across the country. Secondly, we have the additional potential to write business through another subsidiary that we've talked about, our GRMAC subsidiary. And we're only writing in a very narrow handful of states there right now that haven't provided the waivers. So in the next possibility you could do there is just think of that as it's got enough capital in it to write sort of 50-state-type production for about 6 to 12 months. So that's another opportunity. Then you start getting to -- I think, your real question, which is what are some of these other structural alternatives? And I'll just say that we're on ongoing discussions with our regulators, with the GSEs to consider various alternatives that we could -- really when we -- they're really in confidential in discussion right now. But as we get closer to the point that we can bring back and talk with you about them, we'll be glad to do that. One example could be an alternate use of the GRMAC entity and doing something with that structurally. So all on track, these are good potential structural alternatives for us. But really, I'd say where we start with is where -- with our current waivers, we're in good shape and be able to continue to write in the places where we were writing. The last thing I'll just add on to that is when we think about some of these new code structures or alternative structures, one of the things they might give us the ability to do is to prevent an avenue to bring in some external capital outside of Genworth in the event that, that's the alternative that we needed to be able to write the new business, and it wouldn't be reliant then at that point at our own internal capital."

I'll hit sort of some macro assumptions, as well as just I guess point to some of the trends that we're seeing right now and how we feel about those. Back in -- when we gave sort of our expectation that we had a path to profitability back in February, we said we're going to have a burnout of the 2005 to '08 books. Well, we're seeing that. We thought we're going to have -- and that was all based upon an adequacy of our reserves. We're seeing that. It was based upon -- eventually, the referent [ph] performance of the new books of business starting to outweigh the bad books of business, and we're seeing that happen today. The market that we're seeing for mortgage insurance is coming back for us to be able to operate and participate in is in excess of what we had expected back in February at that time. Our share levels are generally holding up, so our -- the combination of that improvement in purchase penetration that's creating the bigger mortgage insurance market, the good pricing we have and the -- and our share performance is helping us. We said we were going to continue to expect loss mitigation benefits at that point. I think we'd see about $300 million and $400 million where we're coming through, and we're going to be exceeding those targets. So we feel good there. When you sort of bring it back all those things and bring them together, we're just on the glide path towards hitting that profitability as we expected back in February. We -- the last thing I think we said at that time is our overall delinquencies and new delinquencies were going to go down about 20%. We're on track. Year-to-date, it's down 23%. So all those trends are heading in the right direction. Getting back to your macro question, we're still expecting, we're going to have -- unemployment is not going to change materially from here on out. We're still going to be operating -- not much help from the growing employment base. Anything that accelerates that right now from the current level could be a good tailwind for us. But we're not expecting any material improvement in unemployment. And in fact, we expect to be sort of elevated throughout 2014. On the peak -- on the HPA basis, we think we've sort of troughed and we've hit the bottom at about a total 20% downturn from the high in the FHFA index. And we really expect that to have slow and gradual growth going forward from here, and we're starting to read more about that and hear about it more in the press today as it materializes out there. So just directionally, all our trends are really heading in the right direction. We feel good about it. The new books are about to get to that inflection point when they start to tip over the experience on the old legacy books, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing."

If you just think about our regulatory capital levels that we're holding to, as you saw in the quarter, our MCR levels came down a bit from where they were in the previous quarter. We had told you that, that was going to happen after our second quarter call, largely the result of the elimination of some reinsurance, affiliate reinsurance that we had in the system that was being provided by the U.S. MI business. So one of the things we're working through is rebuilding and building that MCR back up into a level that we think will be more appropriate in that regulatory environment. And so think of that in the low end 40s to a higher maybe 150 MCR-type level. So we're doing that through the continued improvement in our business performance. We're doing it through looking at other ways of managing the capital, perhaps by the usage of some reinsurance. And so you got to -- we're working through those things with the business right now. They have implications to ultimately the ROE of the business. How much capital you hold is really driving what's the ROE of that business, what's the ROE of that business over a forecasted period of time that you could disclose. When you're doing in some type of public -- some type of IPO-type process, and that all drives valuation. So at the end of the day, it all comes back to valuation. And we just think, as I mentioned earlier, that those valuations will improve as we get deeper into 2013, allowing us to hit a higher valuation and deliver more value to our shareholders."

With respect to the existing business, I really think that the path to building value is proceeding with the announced rate increases and rating changes, particularly on the older book. Because if you were to look at the reinsurance support, it potentially would be a lot better after we complete those re-rating processes rather than before. So while right now, our existing business plan is looking at the re-rating processes as the means of mitigating the losses on the older book and thereby, improving profitability of the book overall. As we finish that, we will, of course, look at reinsurance markets and support and how we're using capital to support that business and as well how to produce the best valuation of the business over time for shareholders."

And when you look at the secondary guarantee universal life portfolio, where you'd probably be most concerned about that, those reserves are only 7% of our total UL reserves. So we did take a close look at our emerging yields. They're actually consistent with prior periods. So while there is exposure to low interest rates, we haven't really seen that impacting our core yields to date. We did make some changes in assumptions, making the projected interest rates for reserving purposes more conservative, and that's what resulted in the change.
