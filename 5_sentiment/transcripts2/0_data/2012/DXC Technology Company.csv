First, I'd like to extend my personal welcome to Mike Laurie as CSC's next President and CEO. I and the entire management team will do all we can to ensure a smooth transition and we look forward to the company's future success under his leadership.
Now turning to the NHS program. We remain in discussions with the U.K. government officials to reach a satisfactory way forward. Once these discussions conclude with or without agreement, we will issue an 8-K announcement with appropriate disclosure. As indicated in this morning's press announcement, our third quarter results include the charge to the NHS program disclosed in our 8-K announcement of 27 December, 2011.
Turning to new business. We continue to see strong improvement year-over-year in our new business performance. For the third quarter, TC bookings totaled $4.1 billion. Year-to-date through the first 3 quarters, we have recorded $13 billion of bookings, a 26% increase over the same period in fiscal year '11. Currently, we have a total of $12 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decisions, of which $8 billion are for opportunities scheduled for work in our fiscal year '12. While some of these opportunities will undoubtedly slip into fiscal '13, we expect the continuation of our solid bookings performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year.
Our North American public sectors fiscal year '12 third quarter top line results continue to reflect the ongoing uncertainty in government budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our client are facing in awarding initiatives. While Congress hasn't acted on appropriations bill for government fiscal year 2012, eliminating the possibility of a government shutdown through the first half of our fiscal year '13, the super committee empowered by the Budget Control Act of 2011 failed to reach agreement, triggering sequestration. While the ultimate impacts of sequestration are subject to debate, the industry is reaching a consensus that anticipates low to mid-single digit revenue declines. We would concur with that perspective.
NPS' Q3 operating margin of 4.3% is net 4 percentage points of negative level results of 2 specific programs. This relates to the curtailment of a large U.S. Department of Defense program that's undergoing a client-driven change in direction and the execution of the contract with the U.S. government civilian agency. We anticipate that the fourth quarter NPS margin performance will return to the high-single digit level.
Our commercial business delivered year-over-year growth of 4.4% year-to-date and 2.5% for the quarter as reported and exclusive of the NHS impairment. With the startup of several new contracts, regional growth was particularly strong in Asia and Australia.
For the third quarter, BSS growth of 5% year-over-year, exclusive of the NHS impairment, drove the top line growth of the commercial business. On a year-to-date basis, BSS growth, exclusive of the third quarter NHS reduction, is 5.1% in constant currency. Geographically, BSS saw positive demand for its services in the Americas and a weakening market in EMEA, particularly on the continent. Exclusive of NHS, we expect BSS to continue to deliver modest growth in the fourth quarter.
Our MSS business continued to improve its sequential operating margin performance. The new leadership team delivered a margin of 6.5% in the third quarter, which results from a 140% sequential improvement in operating income performance. Their result compares to last year's third quarter margin performance of 6.7%. We expect the favorable trend in sequential margin improvement to continue in the fourth quarter.
So looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate solid bookings, margin improvement across all 3 lines of business and another quarter of positive cash performance. I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for more details from the financials."
263093,145779069,217339,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

The essence of this quarter's performance in positioning centers around the items noted on my first chart, in your case, Chart 7, I'll highlight our bookings, the NHS accounting, margin performance and cash flow.
We feel good about the $4 billion in new business bookings and the fact that we have achieved $13 billion year-to-date through December. As you can see from Chart 8, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, we are well ahead of last year, particularly in our commercial business and principally in MSS. Visibility into our fourth quarter pipelines suggest the potential for a comparable outcome in the fourth quarter.
Chart 9 lays out selected P&L data for the quarter, showing our actual results but then separating out the NHS write-down and the goodwill write-off in BSS health care, to reflect how the basic business performed. The specified contract charge is the NHS program and the $204 million revenue reduction arises from the write-off of billed and unbilled NHS receivables. The $1.485 billion OI reduction is just about the entire balance sheet investment in the NHS program as we identified in our 8-K of December 27. Also during the quarter, the BSS-Health reporting unit experienced loss of a significant customer through a merger and did not win some anticipated new business, thus reducing forecasted earnings, considered a triggering event for a goodwill impairment test. The net result of the analysis resulted in a write-off of the remaining BSS-Health care goodwill of $60 million, all of which is described in detail in our 10-Q.
While not noted on the Chart, the tax rate for the quarter is dynamically affected by current and prior period write-offs and is not representative of what might be expected in future periods.
Chart 10 displays revenue by line of business with year-over-year comparisons. The NHS $204 million revenue adjustment is netted in the Q3 FY '12 BSS revenue of $740 million, resulting in almost an 18% year-over-year decline. Absent that adjustment, the BSS revenue would have increased about 5% from both a GAAP and a constant currency basis.
Chart 11 reflects the operating income by line of business for the quarter. Again, the Q3 FY '12 BSS operating income includes the $1.5 billion NHS write-off. Excluding the NHS charge, BSS operating income would be $48 million or 5.1%. That 5.1% includes the intangible purchase accounting amortization from the iSOFT acquisition, which was not in the 9.5% margin rate last year. MSS is about comparable to last year and NPS at 4.7% includes roughly $50 million of contract charges, which are described in our 10-Q.
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items with a comparison to last year. Cash is lower this year by $700 million, primarily the result of acquisitions. Receivables are lowered due to the NHS write-off and the LMP contract settlement. The reduction in prepaids or whip is the NHS write-down. The goodwill impairment in the second and third quarter accounts for the lower goodwill balance.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, the reduction in deferred revenue is primarily the NHS refund of the advanced payment in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $499 million, driven by a significant reduction in receivables as shown on Slide 13. DSOs dropped by 10 days sequentially. In fairness, this is a good news bad news story. The good news was the receipt of the cash from the LMP settlement. The bad news is that the NHS receivable write-off, which was part of the $1.5 billion charge, also contributed to the reduction.
So in summary, what's the takeaway from this quarter? First of all, to understate the obvious, there are lots of moving parts, and it's difficult for you to assess whether our fundamental outlook is improving. In my view, it is. The bookings are encouraging. We are seeing commercial revenue growth in BSS, our growth engine. Although the NHS contract future is uncertain, the large balance sheet exposure has been addressed through the noncash charge. NPS margin for the quarter is disappointing, but we expect a fourth quarter recovery.
MSS margin has improved sequentially, which is 2 quarters in a row with the potential for further improvement in the fourth quarter. And overall, cash flow was good and our debt was reduced. We have $900 million in cash and $1.5 billion undrawn bank line.
One final prepared comment with regard to my personal plans. My informal understanding when I signed on in early December of 2008 was that I would serve 3 to 4 years. I'm excited by the announcement of Mike Laurie as our new CEO. I think that bodes well for the future of the company. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve Mike Laphen. To facilitate a smooth transition, I will stay until we file our 10-Q for this fiscal year, which is approximately mid to late May. This will allow Ms. Laurie time to settle in and select my successor. To facilitate that process, an executive search firm has been engaged to identify 5 potential candidates.
With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

I think as you look at the industry in general and those reporting their numbers for the past quarter, you tend to see low to mid-single-digit reductions. And I think for us, on a sequential basis, we probably will be fairly stable from third quarter to fourth quarter. But I think we still expect to see some erosion next year, and that's just the likely outcome in ongoing pressures. Europe, we have seen some slowdown in our BSS work or project work, particularly in the financial services market and the banking in particular. We're not overly exposed to that.

More often than not, it qualifies for a percentage of completion accounting, which is the proper treatment. If it's a vanilla, and I'll call it vanilla outsourcing transaction, where we're providing service, then it's cost incurred in monthly billing against a billing schedule. So more or less, in the outsourcing arena, the contracts are not percentage of completion. More or less, on the large project, with the development phase aspect to it, there would tend to be percentage of completion treatment. NHS multiyear development phase kind of a contract that falls into the POC view, a large outsourcing engagement for example with Zürich Financial Services would be a straightforward cost incurred in billing kind of a contract without a percentage in completion aspect to it. So it's about as best I can give you in the guidance kind of thing."

First, I'd like to extend my personal welcome to Mike Lawrie as CSC's next President and CEO. I and the entire management team will do all we can to ensure a smooth, efficient transition, and we look forward to the company's future success under his leadership.
Now turning to the NHS program. We remain in discussions with U.K. government officials to reach a satisfactory way forward. Once these discussions conclude with or without agreement, we will issue an 8-K announcement with appropriate disclosure. As indicated in this morning's press announcement, our third quarter results include the charge to the NHS program disclosed in our 8-K announcement of 27 December, 2011.
Turning to new business. We continued to see strong improvement year-over-year in our new business performance. For the third quarter, TCV bookings totaled $4.1 billion. Year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters, we have recorded $13 billion of bookings, a 26% increase over the same period in fiscal year '11. Currently, we have a total of $12 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decisions, of which $8 billion are for opportunities scheduled for award in our fiscal year '12. While some of these opportunities will undoubtedly slip into fiscal year '13, we expect a continuation of our solid bookings performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year.
Our North American Public Sector's fiscal year '12 third quarter top line results continue to reflect the ongoing uncertainty in government budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our clients are facing in awarding new initiatives. While Congress has enacted an appropriations bill for government fiscal year 2012, eliminating the possibility of a government shutdown through the first half of our fiscal year '13, the super committee empowered by the Budget Control Act of 2011 failed to reach agreement, triggering sequestration. While the ultimate impacts of sequestration are subject to debate, the industry is reaching a consensus that anticipates low- to mid-single digit revenue declines. We would concur with that perspective.
NPS's Q3 operating margin of 4.3% is net 4 percentage points of negative impacts that result from 2 specific programs. These relate to the curtailment of a large U.S. Department of Defense program that is undergoing a client-driven change in direction and the execution of a firm fixed price contract with a U.S. government civilian agency. We anticipate that the fourth quarter NPS margin performance will return to the high-single digit level.
Our commercial business delivered year-over-year growth of 4.4% year-to-date and 2.5% for the quarter, as reported and exclusive of the NHS impairment. With the start-up of several new contracts, regional growth was particularly strong in Asia and Australia.
For the third quarter, BSS growth of 5% year-over-year, exclusive of the NHS impairment, drove the top line growth of the commercial business. On a year-to-date basis, BSS growth, exclusive of the third quarter NHS reduction, is 5.1% in constant currency. Geographically, BSS saw positive demand for its services in the Americas and a weakening market in EMEA, particularly on the continent. Exclusive of NHS, we expect BSS to continue to deliver modest growth in the fourth quarter.
Our MSS business continue to improve its sequential operating margin performance. The new leadership team delivered a margin of 6.5% in the third quarter, which results from a 140% sequential improvement in operating income performance. Their result compares to last year's third quarter margin performance of 6.7%. We expect the favorable trend in sequential margin improvement to continue in the fourth quarter.
So looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate solid bookings, margin improvement across all 3 lines of business, and another quarter of positive cash performance. I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for more details from the financials."
263093,145779069,217431,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

The essence of this quarter's performance and positioning centers around the items noted on my first chart. In your case, Chart 7. I'll highlight our bookings, the NHS accounting, margin performance and cash flow.
We feel good about the $4 billion in new business bookings and the fact that we have achieved $13 billion year-to-date through December. As you can see from Chart 8, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, we are well ahead of last year, particularly in our commercial business and principally in MSS. Visibility into our fourth quarter pipeline suggest a potential for a comparable outcome in the fourth quarter.
Chart 9 lays out selected P&L data for the quarter, showing our actual results but then separating out the NHS write-down and the goodwill write-off in BSS healthcare to reflect how the basic business performed. The specified contract charge is the NHS program, and the $204 million revenue reduction arises from the write-off of billed and unbilled NHS receivables. The $1.485 billion OI reduction is just about the entire balance sheet investment in the NHS program as we identified in our 8-K of December 27.
Also, during the quarter, the BSS-Health reporting unit experienced a loss of a significant customer through a merger and did not win some anticipated new business, thus reducing forecasted earnings. Consider it a triggering event for our goodwill impairment test. The net result of the analysis resulted in a write-off of the remaining BSS healthcare goodwill of $60 million, all of which is described in detail in our 10-Q. While not noted on the Chart, the tax rate for the quarter is dynamically affected by current and prior period write-offs and is not representative of what might be expected in future periods.
Chart 10 displays revenue by line of business with year-over-year comparisons. The NHS $204 million revenue adjustment is netted in the Q3 FY '12 BSS revenue of $740 million, resulting in almost an 18% year-over-year decline. Absent that adjustment, BSS revenue would have increased about 5% on both a GAAP and a constant currency basis.
Chart 11 reflects the operating income by line of business for the quarter. Again, the Q3 FY '12 BSS operating income includes the $1.5 billion NHS write-off. Excluding the NHS charge, BSS operating income would be $48 million or 5.1%. That 5.1% includes the intangible purchase accounting amortization from the iSOFT acquisition, which was not in the 9.5% margin rate last year. MSS is about comparable to last year, and NPS at 4.7% includes roughly $50 million of contract charges, which are described in our 10-Q.
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items with a comparison to last year. Cash is lower this year by $700 million, primarily the result of acquisitions. Receivables are lowered due to the NHS write-off and the LMP contract settlement. The reduction in prepaids, or WIP, is the NHS write-down. The goodwill impairment in the second and third quarter accounts for the lower goodwill balance. On the liability side of the balance sheet, the reduction in deferred revenue is primarily the NHS refund of the advanced payment in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $499 million, driven by a significant reduction in receivables as shown on Chart 13. DSOs dropped by 10 days sequentially. In fairness, this is a good news/bad news story. The good news was the receipt of the cash from the LMP settlement. The bad news is that the NHS receivable write-off, which was part of the $1.5 billion charge, also contributed to the reduction.
So in summary, what's the takeaway from this quarter? First of all, to understate the obvious, there are lots of moving parts, and it's difficult for you to assess whether our fundamental outlook is improving. In my view, it is. The bookings are encouraging. We are seeing commercial revenue growth in BSS, our growth engine. Although the NHS contract future is uncertain, the large balance sheet exposure has been addressed through the non-cash charge. NPS margin for the quarter is disappointing, but we expect a fourth quarter recovery.
MSS margin has improved sequentially, which is 2 quarters in a row with the potential for further improvement in the fourth quarter. And overall, cash flow was good, and our debt was reduced. We have $900 million in cash and $1.5 billion undrawn bank line.
One final prepared comment with regard to my personal plans. My informal understanding when I signed on in early December of 2008 was that I would serve 3 to 4 years. I'm excited by the announcement of Mike Lawrie as our new CEO. I think that bodes well for the future of the company. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve Mike Laphen.
To facilitate a smooth transition, I will stay until we file our 10-K for this fiscal year, which is approximately mid to late May. This will allow Mr. Lawrie time to settle in and select my successor. To facilitate that process, an executive search firm has been engaged to identify potential candidates.
With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

Q4, we're not going to stick our necks out on Q4 right now, Bryan, for all the reasons I mentioned before. Relative to the, call it, pro forma guidance of last quarter and $1.50 something, we've reported this quarter something like $1.35 EPS. There's $0.80-plus of benefit in that $1.35 from the tax effect of prior-quarter and current-quarter write-downs, et cetera. So I think in terms of trying to do an apples-and-apples comparison, we'd probably come out on a comparable basis somewhere plus $0.50, $0.55 this quarter relative to the $0.64 or $0.68 or whatever our guidance was for the quarter a year ago -- or a quarter ago. And the principal difference in that are the write-offs that I referred to, contract write-offs in our NPS segment. As you read the Q, there's over $50 million of charges on 2 particular contracts in NPS that diluted our earnings and on a comparable basis would have accounted for the impact in EPS from our pro forma."

Relative to the receivables, I'd refer you to the chart that shows you the absolute trend in receivables. Historically, we had been carrying a significant claim receivable on the government settlement that was inflating our days receivable and pushing us into the high 80s, low 90s. That is behind us now. Then we had the impact of the NHS contract and delays in collecting introduced through the negotiations in the MOU process. I think, and this is opinion going forward, assuming our mix of business stays relatively constant the way we are in mix of contracts, our receivables should be in the low 70s, high 60s. Now that -- obviously, we're right now in the -- somewhere in the mid-70s so to speak. I think there's room for improvement, and I think we can get there. But as you can see, it's going to be a function of time. As far as NPS is concerned, they were one-off charges on major contracts, unique circumstances around each one. Don't anticipate them repeating. Yes, NPS is involved constantly in cost controls, cost reduction, et cetera, et cetera. As the uncertainty around the defense budget continues relative to next year, we will be positioned to take action on the cost side of the equation to size the business proper with the revenue stream that we anticipate. So I would look for activities on our part constantly to improve the NPS margins. I would also add that a portion of NPS's business, not insignificant, is cost reimbursable. So reducing cost makes us more competitive, but it doesn't drop the reduction to the bottom line. So again, you got to filter all that through the equation.

If it's a multi-year generally with a development phase to it, more often than not, it qualifies for percentage of completion accounting, which is the proper treatment. If it's a vanilla, and I'll call it vanilla outsourcing transaction where we're providing service, then it's cost incurred in monthly billing against a billing schedule. So more or less, in the outsourcing arena, the contracts are not percentage of completion. More or less, on the large project with a development phase aspect to it, they would tend to be percentage of completion treatment. NHS multi-year development phase kind of a contract falls into the POC view. A large outsourcing engagement, for example, with Zurich Financial Services, would be a straightforward cost incurred and billing kind of a contract without a percentage in completion aspect to it. So it's about as best I can give you in guidance kind of thing."

Now turning to the NHS program. We remain in discussions with U.K. government officials to reach a satisfactory way forward. Once these discussions conclude, with or without agreement, we will issue an 8-K announcement with appropriate disclosure. As indicated in this morning's press announcement, our third quarter results include the charge to the NHS program disclosed in our 8-K announcement of 27 December, 2011.
Turning to new business. We continued to see strong improvement year-over-year in our new business performance. For the third quarter, TCV bookings totaled $4.1 billion. Year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters, we have recorded $13 billion of bookings, a 26% increase over the same period in fiscal year '11. Currently, we have a total of $12 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decisions, of which $8 billion are for opportunities scheduled for award in our fiscal year '12. While some of these opportunities will undoubtedly slip into fiscal year '13, we expect a continuation of our solid bookings performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year.
Our North American Public Sector's fiscal year '12 third quarter top line results continue to reflect the ongoing uncertainty in government budgets and the day-to-day difficulties our clients are facing in awarding new initiatives. While Congress has enacted an appropriations bill for government fiscal year 2012, eliminating the possibility of a government shutdown through the first half of our fiscal year '13, the super committee empowered by the Budget Control Act of 2011 failed to reach agreement, triggering sequestration. While the ultimate impacts of sequestration are subject to debate, the industry is reaching a consensus that anticipates low- to mid-single digit revenue declines. We would concur with that perspective.
NPS's Q3 operating margin of 4.3% is net 4 percentage points of negative impacts that result from 2 specific programs. These relate to the curtailment of a large U.S. Department of Defense program that is undergoing a client-driven change in direction and the execution of a firm fixed price contract with a U.S. government civilian agency. We anticipate that the fourth quarter NPS margin performance will return to the high-single digit level.
Our commercial business delivered year-over-year growth of 4.4% year-to-date and 2.5% for the quarter, as reported and exclusive of the NHS impairment. With the start-up of several new contracts, regional growth was particularly strong in Asia and Australia.
For the third quarter, BSS growth of 5% year-over-year, exclusive of the NHS impairment, drove the top line growth of the commercial business. On a year-to-date basis, BSS growth, exclusive of the third quarter NHS reduction, is 5.1% in constant currency. Geographically, BSS saw positive demand for its services in the Americas and a weakening market in EMEA, particularly on the continent. Exclusive of NHS, we expect BSS to continue to deliver modest growth in the fourth quarter.
Our MSS business continued to improve its sequential operating margin performance. The new leadership team delivered a margin of 6.5% in the third quarter, which results from a 140% sequential improvement in operating income performance. Their result compares to last year's third quarter margin performance of 6.7%. We expect the favorable trend in sequential margin improvement to continue in the fourth quarter.
So looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate solid bookings, margin improvement across all 3 lines of business and another quarter of positive cash performance. I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for more details from the financials."

The essence of this quarter's performance and positioning centers around the items noted on my first chart. In your case, Chart 7. I'll highlight our bookings, the NHS accounting, margin performance and cash flow.
We feel good about the $4 billion in new business bookings and the fact that we have achieved $13 billion year-to-date through December. As you can see from Chart 8, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, we are well ahead of last year, particularly in our commercial business and principally in MSS. Visibility into our fourth quarter pipeline suggests the potential for a comparable outcome in the fourth quarter.
Chart 9 lays out selected P&L data for the quarter, showing our actual results but then separating out the NHS write-down and the goodwill write-off in BSS healthcare to reflect how the basic business performed. The specified contract charge is the NHS program, and the $204 million revenue reduction arises from the write-off of billed and unbilled NHS receivables. The $1.485 billion OI reduction is just about the entire balance sheet investment in the NHS program as we identified in our 8-K of December 27. 
Also, during the quarter, the BSS-Health reporting unit experienced a loss of a significant customer through a merger and did not win some anticipated new business, thus reducing forecasted earnings considered a triggering event for our goodwill impairment test. The net result of the analysis resulted in a write-off of the remaining BSS healthcare goodwill of $60 million, all of which is described in detail in our 10-Q. While not noted on the chart, the tax rate for the quarter is dynamically affected by current and prior period write-offs and is not representative of what might be expected in future periods.
Chart 10 displays revenue by line of business with year-over-year comparisons. The NHS $204 million revenue adjustment is netted in the Q3 FY '12 BSS revenue of $740 million, resulting in almost an 18% year-over-year decline. Absent that adjustment, BSS revenue would have increased about 5% on both a GAAP and a constant currency basis.
Chart 11 reflects the operating income by line of business for the quarter. Again, the Q3 FY '12 BSS operating income includes the $1.5 billion NHS write-off. Excluding the NHS charge, BSS operating income would be $48 million or 5.1%. That 5.1% includes the intangible purchase accounting amortization from the iSOFT acquisition, which was not in the 9.5% margin rate last year. MSS is about comparable to last year, and NPS at 4.7% includes roughly $50 million of contract charges, which are described in our 10-Q.
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items with a comparison to last year. Cash is lower this year by $700 million, primarily the result of acquisitions. Receivables are lower due to the NHS write-off and the LMP contract settlement. The reduction in prepaids, or WIP, is the NHS write-down. The goodwill impairment in the second and third quarter accounts for the lower goodwill balance. On the liability side of the balance sheet, the reduction in deferred revenue is primarily the NHS refund of the advanced payment in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $499 million, driven by a significant reduction in receivables as shown on Chart 13. DSOs dropped by 10 days sequentially. In fairness, this is a good news/bad news story. The good news was the receipt of the cash from the LMP settlement. The bad news is that the NHS receivable write-off, which was part of the $1.5 billion charge, also contributed to the reduction.
So in summary, what's the takeaway from this quarter? First of all, to understate the obvious, there are lots of moving parts, and it's difficult for you to assess whether our fundamental outlook is improving. In my view, it is. The bookings are encouraging. We are seeing commercial revenue growth in BSS, our growth engine. Although the NHS contract future is uncertain, the large balance sheet exposure has been addressed through the non-cash charge. NPS margin for the quarter is disappointing, but we expect a fourth quarter recovery.
MSS margin has improved sequentially, which is 2 quarters in a row with the potential for further improvement in the fourth quarter. And overall, cash flow was good, and our debt was reduced. We have $900 million in cash and $1.5 billion undrawn bank line.
One final prepared comment with regard to my personal plans. My informal understanding when I signed on in early December of 2008 was that I would serve 3 to 4 years. I'm excited by the announcement of Mike Lawrie as our new CEO. I think that bodes well for the future of the company. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve Mike Laphen.
To facilitate a smooth transition, I will stay until we file our 10-K for this fiscal year, which is approximately mid to late May. This will allow Mr. Lawrie time to settle in and select my successor. To facilitate that process, an executive search firm has been engaged to identify potential candidates.
With that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to start the Q&A."

Relative to the receivables, I'd refer you to the chart that shows you the absolute trend in receivables. Historically, we had been carrying a significant claim receivable on the government settlement that was inflating our days receivable and pushing us into the high 80s, low 90s. That is behind us now. Then we had the impact of the NHS contract and delays in collecting introduced through the negotiations in the MOU process. I think, and this is opinion going forward, assuming our mix of business stays relatively constant the way we are in mix of contracts, our receivables should be in the low 70s, high 60s. Now that -- obviously, we're right now in the -- somewhere in the mid-70s so to speak. I think there's room for improvement, and I think we can get there. But as you can see, it's going to be a function of time. As far as NPS is concerned, they were one-off charges on major contracts, unique circumstances around each one. Don't anticipate them repeating. Yes, NPS is involved constantly in cost controls, cost reduction, et cetera, et cetera. As the uncertainty around the defense budget continues relative to next year, we will be positioned to take action on the cost side of the equation to size the business proper with the revenue stream that we anticipate. So I would look for activities on our part constantly to improve the NPS margins. I would also add that a portion of NPS's business, not insignificant, is cost reimbursable. So reducing cost makes us more competitive, but it doesn't drop the reduction to the bottom line. So again, you got to filter all that through the equation. But cost performance and cost competitiveness is on the forefront of our focus in NPS."

If it's multi-year generally with a development phase to it, more often than not, it qualifies for percentage of completion accounting, which is the proper treatment. If it's a vanilla, and I'll call it vanilla outsourcing transaction where we're providing service, then it's cost incurred in monthly billing against a billing schedule. So more or less, in the outsourcing arena, the contracts are not percentage of completion. More or less, on the large project with a development phase aspect to it, they would tend to be percentage of completion treatment. NHS multi-year development phase kind of a contract falls into the POC view. A large outsourcing engagement, for example, with Zurich Financial Services, would be a straightforward cost incurred and billing kind of a contract without a percentage in completion aspect to it. So that's about as best I can give you in guidance kind of thing."

Thanks for taking some time with us this morning. I am joined by Mike Mancuso, will cover the numbers.

Thanks for taking some time with us this morning. I am joined by Mike Mancuso, will cover the numbers. And as you probably know, this will be Mike's last earnings call with CSC as he will be retiring, and I just wanted to thank Mike for with almost 4 years of service, somewhat tumultuous, but service, but thank you very much. 
And as I think, earlier this week, we announced Mike's successor CFO, Paul Saleh. Paul's recognized and a very much respected CFO for leading brands such as Kinect and Sprint Nextel and Walt Disney International, and he's led global finance functions for companies in the midst of significant change and industry transition and knows the role that the finance community plays in that type of turnaround environment and has a long track record of achieving profitability improvements and increasing shareholder value. So Paul will be on board May 23. And I'm sure at that point in time, he will begin to outreach to some of you on the call today. 
Let me make a couple remarks before I turn this over to Mike. I really got 4 key messages this morning. One, is that our results are very poor and they are unacceptable to us at CSC and they're certainly unacceptable to our investors. The second message is, that we are taking immediate actions to be begin to move in a different direction. I will cover some of those actions today and there'll be some more actions in the coming weeks and months. The third message is, that although the negatives overwhelmed our results, there are some bright spots, and I do want to highlight some of those bright spots, particularly around some of our new offerings that I think represents the future of the company. And then the final message is, that I've now completed a sort of tour of the world and visit many of our sites and many of our clients, many of our investors, many of the analysts that follow CSC and have a pretty good handle on what the issues are, what the root causes of those issues are and we are developing a plan to address these, as well as the underlying financial model, and we intend to share that in greater detail when we get together in early September for the Analyst/Investor Day. 
So those are the 4 key messages, now let me just quickly provide little more detail around each of those messages. And as I said several weeks ago and again today, the results are very poor. The primary reasons for that are the NHS write-offs. The second principal driver was troubled contracts within our MSS business that resulted in impairment and restructuring charges. I don't think we managed our cost structure to adjust for some of these developments as they unrolled themselves throughout the second half of the fiscal year. I think we've got some organizational or I call operating model alignment issues which has made execution that much more problematic. And obviously, we continue to see some uncertainty, particularly in the federal sector and in EMEA. So those are the primary causes of the poor results, not substantially different than what we've talked about before. 
But the second message is, okay, what are we doing about that? So we're taking some immediate actions. One, we're announcing today a $1 billion cost and expense takeout program to be executed over 12- to 18-month period. Much of that will be delivered to the bottom line. Some will be reinvested in some of the things we need to do internally. But that has now been announced internally and we are announcing that today. 
The second action is a thorough review of our portfolio of contracts. In the past several months, we now concluded a thorough portfolio review, which involve the systems assurance reviews of all of our outstanding outsourcing contracts. We have identified 40 troubled contracts, the majority of which, around 32, are in our MSS business. And for all of these accounts, we have now implemented or are in the process of implementing remediation actions, including new leadership, transition controls, strong program management disciplines, and this gets monitored on a weekly basis and with me on a monthly basis. And some of the accounts really don't show a clear path to financial health, and in these cases, we are intending to either fix them or, in some cases, attempt to renegotiate them. 
And to prevent a reoccurrence of what we saw in fiscal '12, we've put a systems assurance program in place and this team has now reviewed all material contracts, and what I mean by material contracts is anything over $50 million, as well as all the MSS contracts in our backlog. And we want to make sure that with our bookings, particularly in the last half of fiscal '12, we want to ensure that we didn't sign up for more problems and that we can deliver against these contracts at acceptable profitability. And in terms of new opportunities that are in the pipeline, we have now put a very strong contracting process in place where we review the pricing and the scope before we commit to the contract again as a way of trying to ensure that we contract at and deliver acceptable profitability. 
In terms of NHS, I was over in the U.K. late last week and met with the head of NHS. There's no question that we want to -- both parties want to get to this interim agreement and we now are, on a weekly basis, the head of NHS and myself are getting together to resolve any issues along the lines of the letter of intent which we announced several months ago. So we're hopeful that the NHS interim agreement will get completed in the not-too-distant future. And I think, having myself and the head of NHS on the phone every week working through any remaining issues is going to be a helpful management discipline to getting this across the line. 
In terms of our operating model, as I said, the lack of clarity and accountability led to or was a contributor to execution issues. I think a lot of our root cause problems do stem from the complexity of our operating model. In many cases, it really lacks the clarity and accountability that we need and that's severely reduces our ability to act decisively. So we're working to simplify that model so that it is fully aligned and we've got clear lines of accountability. That operating model has been designed. I've covered it with the board, and over the coming weeks and months, we will begin to execute against that. 
Another action we've taken is leadership. As you know, we are adding a new leadership talent. Paul Saleh, as I said earlier, was announced as the CFO, but you can expect more management appointments in the coming weeks. In April, we launched a new management compensation program, which aligns our compensation for our top executives to company profitability results, and I think this is a major step towards getting our leaders in line with our shareholders and, again, simplifying some of the operating model clarity issues that we have. 
And then finally, we have begun a pretty intensive review of our noncore assets. We are evaluating our portfolio to determine what noncore assets are available for disposal, again, with the goal of delivering incremental cash, as well as improving our profitability along our financial model as we go forward. So those are sort of the list of actions. I should mention that this cost takeout program, although substantial at $1 billion is primarily focused at what I'll call G&A functions, procurement, IT and other G&A functions. It does not affect in any material way our customer-facing resources. 
So the turnaround is beginning to take shape. As I said, we have had a chance to speak with all major constituencies. I've had quite a few outside experts into help with the strategy formulation. I've had the chance and I'll cover this with my board this week, but there are a couple of elements of the strategy which are becoming very clear. And again, in early September, when we get together, we will fill out more of the details associated with it. But suffice it to say, part of this will revolve around refocusing our portfolio to move up the value chain, a much more precise focus on verticals, on industries that we want to really take a leadership position in and have a lot of intellectual property around to drive that leadership position, a movement to standardize global solutions that can be delivered to any client and deliver profitably with particular focus on some of our newly emerging offerings like cloud and Cyber and our applications and business process services businesses; and much better expansion and leverage of our software assets which we think are very valuable and that have largely been buried within the company. 
So as I said, we're setting a date here for our Investor Day of September 10. We'll share more details at that meeting around our turnaround progress, other actions we're taking, a more detailed review of the strategy, our operating model and the underlying financial model of the company over the next 2 or 3 years, so that you, as our investors and analysts, can track our progress against that financial model. And you'll be hearing more from us as to the date of the location and so on and so forth. 
So just before I turn it over to Mike, there are a few bright spots that I'd like to just highlight for a moment. Again, these bright spots were largely overwhelmed by some of the huge issues we had. But for example, our total contract value results were very positive at $19.3 billion. That's a 30% increase over fiscal '11. And the good news is, this came from 150 new commercial clients, as well as successful recompetes and a lot of new scope work for new, as well as existing clients. And we have more than $28 billion in our qualified pipeline. So I think this really bodes very well and is an indication of CSC's market relevance, as well as the demand for many of our offerings. 
And speaking of those offerings, things like our cloud offerings are beginning to gain traction in terms of adoption. In fiscal '12, we recorded $203 million in wins for our commercial cloud services and we have over $900 million in our qualified pipeline for fiscal '13, so clearly, getting some traction around cloud and we've recently received some awards in our leadership, so I think that is a very important positive point. 
Our Cyber offerings during 2012, we were awarded $48 million in commercial Cyber wins and $350 million in Cyber wins within our NPS business. And the qualified pipeline here, we've got over $700 million of qualified pipeline for our NPS business as we look out in fiscal '13. 
And then finally, some of the acquisitions we've made, we're seeing some good traction around the results for iSOFT. We saw a revenue of $139 million, in the 8 months that they're included in our full year results. But more importantly, we saw some very positive trends in our software license sales and revenues. And we have over 100 go-lives of major iSOFT contracts and projects around the world. 
And our AppLabs business that we acquired, that integration is going well, it's becoming a very important part of our end-to-end offering and Application Services and we saw about $60 million of revenue in the time that we owned that business. So again, some positive signs around some of the acquisitions that we made. 
So that's the comments I want to make. I'll turn it over to Mike, and then I'll come back with a few closing comments, and then we'll open it up to any questions that you might have. Mike?"
263093,204814341,309000,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning to all. My remarks will be brief this morning. As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10. If you turn to Chart 7, and echoing Mike's commentary, new business boo",501,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning to all. My remarks will be brief this morning. As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10. If you turn to Chart 7, and echoing Mike's commentary, new business bookings are one of our fiscal 2012 bright spots, with awards totaling $19.3 billion. Our backlog now totals $36.4 billion as of March 30. And as you can see from the chart, MSS led the way with $9.5 billion in awards. 
Revenue by line of business for the fourth quarter is displayed on Chart 8 with comparison to last year. Total revenue declined about 2%, largely attributable to our NPS segment. Our commercial business, principally BSS, grew about 1.3% in constant currency and was roughly flat on a GAAP basis. 
The operating loss for the quarter, as reflected on Chart 9, is obviously disappointing. Mike Lawrie commented on a number of the macro causes. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, technical challenges on problem contracts in NPS and MSS, coupled with the restructuring charges in MSS and BSS, and the expensing of our ongoing work on the NHS contract in BSS are the main drivers of the operating loss. 
Chart 10 is the fourth quarter P&L statement. I would direct your attention to the corporate G&A and net interest expense lines. Legal cost in G&A and a lower cash balance, larger interest payments on capital leases all result in an unfavorable comparison to last year. 
Chart 11 summarizes FY '12 results through EPS and reflects a comparison to the EPS numbers contained in our April 10th release. This chart also lays out the revenue, OI and EPS impact of the more significant events within this year. 
Focusing on operating income and adjusting FY '12 results for the NHS contract charge and restructuring, the margin would be approximately 2.3%. The statement at the bottom of the chart is intended to highlight the fact that at a 32% tax rate versus our FY '12 roughly 3% tax rate, we'd have reduced our reported results by about $0.90. This will be important to you as you think about fiscal year '13. 
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items. Our cash balance versus last year is lower by virtue of the iSOFT and AppLabs acquisitions, as well as lower earnings. The claim settlement and the NHS write-off affected receivables and WIP. The goodwill impairment charge is evident in the lower goodwill balance. The third revenue is lower absent any NHS advance payments this year, and of course, the equity number is a result of the above factors. 
And finally, on Chart 13, it shows an improvement in days sales outstanding. Removing the uncollected or the unbilled claim balance and the NHS receivables, was a big factor in the reduction. The good news is that going forward, we can and should operate at a number well below our historical average. 
With that said now, I'm going to turn it back to Mike Lawrie."

Given that we are in a turnaround situation, I don't think it's all that meaningful to provide quarterly targets. As we said in the press release, we are going to issue some annual targets for fiscal '13 at a later date, probably at our August earnings call, the very latest when we get together in September. I'd just like little bit more time to understand some of the financial impact of the turnaround activities that I have already announced. 
But given the results that Mike just covered, here's how I would think about fiscal '13. Due to the continued budget uncertainty, particularly in the federal space, I think we expect our revenue in NPS to most likely decline by mid-single digits. So think of this as sort of a 3% to 5% kind of a decline. On the commercial side, we anticipate flat revenue, primarily due to some of the headwinds we see, but also we are clearly going to focus on profitability in the near term. So we are not going to sign business just for the sake of signing business, but to drive improvements in profitability. 
With respect to our operating margin, the improvement initiatives that I talked about earlier in this call should generate somewhat in the neighborhood of 200 to 300 basis points improvement over the adjusted fiscal '12 numbers in the walk-through that Mike just took you through. We do expect the tax rate, our normal tax rate, around 32% in fiscal '13, and then EPS can be fairly easily derived from those other inputs on the other variables. So we'll continue to work on the forecast, and again, as I said, we'll provide more detail on the underlying financial models, so not only what you can expect over the next 6 months, but the model that we want to get on over the next 2 or 3 years as we progress the turnaround program. 
So those are just a couple of thoughts on targets and a little more clarity around the walk-through so everyone understands the adjusted numbers and the baseline, if you will. So with that, operator, why don't we open it up for questions?"

I'm trying to get a little better handle on what I can expect. There are some major changes. I mean, for example, we're reducing dramatically the number of people that have authority to have control of our spending. When I don't have any concrete numbers said as to how that's going to begin to play out month by month. So I would like see that. We've put probably, in our budget for this year, around $500 million to $600 million of those cost savings we have factored into the budget that we deployed internally. And then part of that is the cost savings, part of that is probably $100 million to $200 million of improvement we'd like to see in our MSS troubled contracts that we just talked about. All that is factored into what we have deployed for the new fiscal year in terms of a budget. What I don't yet have, again just in total candor is, I don't have any results yet, so I don't know the traction underneath some of these initiatives. That's why I'm saying when we get together in August and again September, I'm going to have a little more facts, and from that, I can begin to extrapolate what I think will play out this fiscal year, then can provide a little more clarity and a little more precision around that. But I wanted to give you a rough idea of what this looks like in terms of financial model for fiscal '13. In terms of reinvestment, I don't know. Part of that will be some systems. We obviously have a lot of work to do with our financial systems and we've got work that's undergoing right now, putting that plan together. So I just don't yet have a precise number of how much will be reinvested. My thinking is, that the majority of this will be dropped to the bottom line."

I mean, it's little things. For example, today, we've put some very skilled contracting people on these deals as they work towards closure. But then often those people that have very good inside around these contracts, we reassign them to other new opportunities. So we actually lose that institutional knowledge around how the contract was structured, where some of the soft spots are in the contract, what the intent was. So one of the little changes that we've made is, we're going to keep those contract people that are part of the close process. They will stay with that contract through the life of the contract. So those are ways that you don't have this interruption of knowledge and interruption in a handoff that can often contribute to transition services problems. And then as scope changes occurring some of these contracts, you don't have the institutional knowledge to manage that more effectively. So it's little things like that, that allow us to deal prospectively with new business whereas the troubled contract process deals with things that have already occurred in an effort to remediate this."

So while we will not experience another claim charge of the magnitude that's referenced here, we hopefully will incur something in the same neighborhood where bonus payments across a Corporation to a very dedicated work force. So they kind of offset. The iSOFT thing is down in a nice level. Certainly iSOFT profitability will improve and revenue growth and looking at 3 quarters' worth. The bulk of the loss this year at iSOFT is predominantly purchase accounting and investments that we're making in some of the systems and the ingestion of iSOFT into CSC. Some of that will occur next year. I don't expect iSOFT to have a $93 million loss next year, but then again, I don't expect it to turn to robust profitability. So we've kind of set iSOFT aside as we continue with the integration and the maturation of the Lorenzo installations around the world. I hope that helps."

We are not in turn using a metric this year of return on invested capital. When we get together in September, I'll have a little bit more to say on return on invested capital. I mean, clearly, we're not making our cost of capital today with these results. And depending on the degree of success turning some of these infrastructure accounts around, I don't know whether we'll return cost of capital in fiscal '13. But what I can tell you is that the financial model will get us to an adequate return in excess of our cost of capital. I would share that when we get together in September. I'm looking at a total for the entire CSC portfolio, as well as some of the subsegments like our infrastructure business, for example, which we'll set up the need over time of transition until we close these next-generation infrastructure offerings like cloud, storage as a service, et cetera, et cetera. So the answer is, we will share that financial model and our projections for return on invested capital. And, no, we're not using that as a measurement in this year's compensation for the top 2,300 executives."

I just can't tell you what the results yet because I don't have enough time to lapse between putting in place and seeing results. But these are big areas. I mean for example, we spend about $7 billion a year on indirect purchasing. Is that about right, Mike, roughly? And we've got 300 or 400 people in this company that can sign off on POs, and we don't aggregate a lot of that spend. So it doesn't take a huge percentage of a spend like that to begin to yield some benefits. But as you reduce the number of people that do have the ability to sign off on some of these POs as you would renegotiate some of the contracts we have with suppliers, all those things, I think, will yield pretty significant results. I just don't have a great position yet on how that will play out and what time frame. Does that help?"

So what we find here at headquarters, so what Mike Mancuso found as a CFO in his 3 or 4 years here, by the time he found it, it was often in pretty bad shape because a holding company mentality, things just sort of roll out and reports what has, in fact, happened. The big transition we're making is moving to an operating company. And then an operating company looks for what to be anticipated results are going to be and then operates and tries to change the outcome through management actions and other disciplined processes that are in store. So if I look back over Mike's tenure, I find it very difficult for him to try to manage within a holding company environment, and there's not a great example in the technology industry of a company that really works as a holding company. But as we move and make this transition to an operating company, install enterprise processes like consistent financial systems and consistent product line management systems and consistent sales management systems and consistent HR and compensation and benefits systems, as you begin to make that shift, you have much more visibility to what's going on in the company before it becomes an issue, and therefore, you've got a higher probability of being able to successfully manage better outcomes. So I don't want to put words in your mouth, Mike, but that's a fundamental shift how we're going to run the business."

Because it sounds like, clearly, you want to exit some smaller pieces of noncore business, perhaps some pruning of the current contract base? Is there a scenario here, Mike, where ultimately you shrink the company from a revenue perspective, but drive higher levels of profitability with less risk across the portfolio? Is that a potential outcome here? Or do you think that some tangible level of consistent top line growth will be the byproduct of your turnaround over the next couple of years?"

But fundamentally, yes, I do think this company could shrink a little bit in terms of revenue over the next year to 18 months as we prune some unprofitable or less profitable pieces of the portfolio, absolutely. And again, for the next year or so, we are going to be majoring more on profitability then we are on revenue growth. And that, coupled with some of the headwinds we have, particularly in our NPS business, could -- I think, a very probable outcome would be lower revenue, but much higher profitability as we've talked about. Once you get stabilized from a profitability standpoint and you're executing against a financial model, then I think you can begin to grow the business. You can grow the business organically, you can grow it inorganically and that really will be the, I think, second phase of the turnaround, is where we begin to grow consistent with the market. But we're able to grow, we're able to integrate so that we don't have these huge execution gaps that result in deteriorating profitability. So that's how I think about it as we go forward from a 30,000-foot level."

What we haven't done is, we haven't got that focused in a way where it provides as much leverage to our financials and as much leverage to other activities like our development activities, particularly in software, that I would like to see. For example, iSOFT, iSOFT has got of fantastic development center in Chennai. I spent a whole day going through the entire product program. But we haven't gotten that all focused in a way that really leverages the company. So from a pure do you have people offshore, yes, we do, and it's roughly in line with what many of our competitors done.

Thanks for taking some time with us this morning. I am joined by Mike Mancuso, who will cover the numbers. And as you probably know, this will be Mike's last earnings call with CSC as he will be retiring, and I just wanted to thank Mike for -- with almost 4 years of service, somewhat tumultuous, but service, but thank you very much.
And as I think, earlier this week, we announced Mike's successor CFO, Paul Saleh. Paul's recognized and a very much respected CFO for leading brands such as Gannett and Sprint Nextel and Walt Disney International. And he's led global finance functions for companies in the midst of significant change and industry transition and knows the role that the finance community plays in that type of turnaround environment and has a long track record of achieving profitability improvements and increasing shareholder value. So Paul will be on board May 23. And I'm sure at that point in time, he will begin to outreach to some of you on the call today.
Let me make a couple remarks before I turn this over to Mike. I really got 4 key messages this morning. One, is that our results are very poor, and they are unacceptable to us at CSC, and they're certainly unacceptable to our investors. The second message is, that we are taking immediate actions to be begin to move in a different direction. I will cover some of those actions today, and there'll be some more actions in the coming weeks and months. The third message is, that although the negatives overwhelmed our results, there are some bright spots, and I do want to highlight some of those bright spots, particularly around some of our new offerings that I think represents the future of the company. And then the final message is, that I've now completed a sort of tour of the world and visited many of our sites and many of our clients, many of our investors and many of the analysts that follow CSC and have a pretty good handle on what the issues are, what the root causes of those issues are, and we are developing a plan to address these, as well as the underlying financial model. And we intend to share that in greater detail when we get together in early September for the Analyst/Investor Day.
So those are the 4 key messages, now let me just quickly provide a little more detail around each of those messages. And as I said several weeks ago and again today, the results are very poor. The primary reasons for that are the NHS write-offs. The second principal driver was troubled contracts within our MSS business that resulted in impairment and restructuring charges. I don't think we managed our cost structure to adjust for some of these developments as they unrolled themselves throughout the second half of the fiscal year. I think we've got some organizational or I call operating model alignment issues, which has made execution that much more problematic. And obviously, we continue to see some uncertainty, particularly in the federal sector and in EMEA. So those are the primary causes of the poor results, not substantially different than what we talked about before.
But the second message is, okay, what are we doing about that? So we're taking some immediate actions. One, we're announcing today a $1 billion cost and expense takeout program to be executed over a 12- to 18-month period. Much of that will be delivered to the bottom line. Some will be reinvested in some of the things we need to do internally. But that has now been announced internally, and we are announcing that today.
The second action is a thorough review of our portfolio of contracts. In the past several months, we now concluded a thorough portfolio review, which involve the systems assurance reviews of all of our outstanding outsourcing contracts. We have identified 40 troubled contracts, the majority of which, around 32, are in our MSS business. And for all of these accounts, we have now implemented or are in the process of implementing remediation actions, including new leadership, transition controls, strong program management disciplines, and this gets monitored on a weekly basis and with me on a monthly basis. And some of the accounts really don't show a clear path to financial health, and in these cases, we are intending to either fix them or in some cases, attempt to renegotiate them.
And to prevent a reoccurrence of what we saw in fiscal '12, we've put a systems assurance program in place. And this team has now reviewed all material contracts, and what I mean by material contracts is anything over $50 million, as well as all the MSS contracts in our backlog. And we want to make sure that with our bookings, particularly in the last half of fiscal '12, we want to ensure that we didn't sign up for more problems, and that we can deliver against these contracts at acceptable profitability. And in terms of new opportunities that are in the pipeline, we have now put a very strong contracting process in place where we review the pricing and the scope before we commit to the contract again as a way of trying to ensure that we contract at and deliver acceptable profitability.
In terms of NHS, I was over in the U.K. late last week and met with the head of NHS. There's no question we want to -- both parties want to get to this interim agreement and we now are, on a weekly basis, the head of NHS and myself are getting together to resolve any issues along the lines of the letter of intent which we announced several months ago. So we're hopeful that the NHS interim agreement will get completed in the not-too-distant future. And I think, having myself and the head of NHS on the phone every week working through any remaining issues is going to be a helpful management discipline to getting this across the line.
In terms of our operating model, as I said, the lack of clarity and accountability led to or was a contributor to execution issues. I think a lot of our root cause problems do stem from the complexity of our operating model. In many cases, it really lacks the clarity and the accountability that we need, and that severely reduces our ability to act decisively. So we're working to simplify that model so that it is fully aligned, and we've got clear lines of accountability. That operating model has been designed. I've covered it with the board, and over the coming weeks and months, we will begin to execute against that.
Another action we've taken is leadership. As you know, we are adding a new leadership talent. Paul Saleh, as I said earlier, was announced as the CFO. But you can expect more management appointments in the coming weeks. In April, we launched a new management compensation program, which aligns our compensation for our top executives to company profitability results, and I think this is a major step towards getting our leaders in line with our shareholders and, again, simplifying some of the operating model clarity issues that we have.
And then finally, we have begun a pretty intensive review of our noncore assets. We are evaluating our portfolio to determine what noncore assets are available for disposal, again, with the goal of delivering incremental cash, as well as improving our profitability along our financial model as we go forward. So those are sort of the list of actions. I should just mention that this cost takeout program, although substantial at $1 billion is primarily focused at what I'll call G&A functions, procurement, IT and other G&A functions. It does not affect in any material way our customer-facing resources.
So the turnaround is beginning to take shape. As I said, we have had a chance to speak with all major constituencies. I've had quite a few outside experts in to help with the strategy formulation. I've had the chance, and I'll cover this with my board this week, but there are a couple of elements of the strategy which are becoming very clear. And again, in early September, when we get together, we will fill out more of the details associated with it. But suffice it to say, part of this will revolve around refocusing our portfolio to move up the value chain, a much more precise focus on verticals, on industries that we want to really take a leadership position in and have a lot of intellectual property around to drive that leadership position, a movement to standardize global solutions that can be delivered to any client and delivered profitably, with particular focus on some of our new emerging offerings like cloud and Cyber and our applications and business process services businesses, and much better expansion and leverage of our software assets, which we think are very valuable and that have largely been buried within in the company.
So as I said, we're setting a date here for our Investor Day of September 10. We'll share more details at that meeting around our turnaround progress, other actions we are taking, a more detailed review of the strategy, our operating model and the underlying financial model of the company over the next 2 or 3 years. So that you, as our investors and analysts, can track our progress against that financial model. And you'll be hearing more from us as to the date and the location and so on and so forth.
So just before I turn it over to Mike, there are a few bright spots that I'd like to just highlight for a moment. Again, these bright spots were largely overwhelmed by some of the huge issues we had. But for example, our total contract value results were very positive at $19.3 billion. That's a 30% increase over fiscal '11. And the good news is, this came from 150 new commercial clients, as well as successful recompetes and a lot of new scope work for new, as well as existing clients. And we have more than $28 billion in our qualified pipeline. So I think this really bodes very well and is an indication of CSC's market relevance, as well as the demand for many of our offerings.
And speaking of those offerings, things like our cloud offerings are beginning to gain traction in terms of adoption. In fiscal '12, we recorded $203 million in wins for our commercial cloud services, and we have over $900 million in our qualified pipeline for fiscal '13. So clearly, getting some traction around cloud, and we've recently received some awards on our leadership. So I think that is a very important positive point.
Our Cyber offerings during 2012, we were awarded $48 million in commercial Cyber wins and $350 million in Cyber wins within our NPS business. And the qualified pipeline here, we've got over $700 million of qualified pipeline for our NPS business as we look out in fiscal '13.
And then finally, some of the acquisitions we've made, we're seeing some good traction around the results for iSOFT. We saw revenue of $139 million, the 8 months that they're included in our full year results. But more importantly, we saw some very positive trends in our software license sales and revenues. And we have over 100 go-lives of major iSOFT contracts and projects around the world.
And our AppLabs business that we acquired, that integration is going well. It's becoming a very important part of our end-to-end offering in application services, and we saw about $60 million of revenue in the time that we owned that business. So again, some positive signs around some of the acquisitions that we made.
So that's the comments I want to make. I'll turn it over to Mike, and then I'll come back for a few closing comments, and then we'll open it up to any questions that you might have. Mike?"

My remarks will be brief this morning. As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10. If you turn to Chart 7, and echoing Mike's commentary, new business boo",501,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning to all. My remarks will be brief this morning. As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10. If you turn to Chart 7, and echoing Mike's commentary, new business bookings are one of our fiscal year '12 bright spots, with awards totaling $19.3 billion. Our backlog now totals $36.4 billion as of March 30. And as you can see from the chart, MSS led the way with $9.5 billion in awards.
Revenue by line of business for the fourth quarter is displayed on Chart 8, with comparison to last year. Total revenue declined about 2%, largely attributable to our NPS segment. Our commercial business, principally BSS, grew about 1.3% in constant currency and was roughly flat on a GAAP basis.
The operating loss for the quarter, as reflected on Chart 9, is obviously disappointing. Mike Lawrie commented on a number of the macro causes. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, technical challenges on problem contracts in NPS and MSS, coupled with the restructuring charges in MSS and BSS, and the expensing of our ongoing work on the NHS contract in BSS are the main drivers of the operating loss.
Chart 10 is the fourth quarter P&L statement. I would direct your attention to the corporate G&A and net interest expense lines. Legal cost and G&A and a lower cash balance, larger interest payments on capital leases all result in an unfavorable comparison to last year.
Chart 11 summarizes FY '12 results through EPS and reflects a comparison to the EPS numbers contained in our April 10 release. This chart also lays out the revenue, OI and EPS impact of the more significant events within this year.
Focusing on operating income and adjusting FY '12 results for the NHS contract charge and restructuring, the margin would be approximately 2.3%. The statement at the bottom of the chart is intended to highlight the fact that at a 32% tax rate versus our FY '12 roughly 3% tax rate, would have reduced our reported results by about $0.90. This will be important to you as you think about fiscal year '13.
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items. Our cash balance versus last year is lower by virtue of the iSOFT and AppLabs acquisitions, as well as lower earnings. The claim settlement and the NHS write-off affected receivables and WIP. The goodwill impairment charge is evident in the lower goodwill balance. Deferred revenue is lower absent any NHS advance payments this year, and of course, the equity number is a result of the above factors.
And finally, on Chart 13, it shows an improvement in days sales outstanding. Removing the uncollected or the unbilled claim balance and the NHS receivables was a big factor in the reduction. The good news is that going forward, we can and should operate at a number well below our historical average.
With that said now, I'm going to turn it back to Mike Lawrie."

Given that we are in a turnaround situation, I don't think it's all that meaningful to provide quarterly targets. As we said in the press release, we are going to issue some annual targets for fiscal '13 at a later date, probably at our August earnings call, the very latest when we get together in September. I'd just like a little more time to understand some of the financial impact of the turnaround activities that I have already announced.
But given the results that Mike just covered, here's how I would think about fiscal '13. Due to the continued budget uncertainty, particularly in the federal space, I think we expect our revenue in NPS to most likely decline by mid-single digits. So think of this as sort of a 3% to 5% kind of decline. On the commercial side, we anticipate flat revenue, primarily due to some of the headwinds we see, but also we are clearly going to focus on profitability in the near term. So we are not going to sign business just for the sake of signing business, but to drive improvements in profitability.
With respect to our operating margin, the improvement initiatives that I talked about earlier in this call should generate somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 to 300 basis points improvement over the adjusted fiscal '12 numbers in the walk-through that Mike just took you through. We do expect the tax rate, our normal tax rate, around 32% in fiscal '13, and then EPS can be fairly easily derived from those other inputs on the other variables. So we'll continue to work on the forecast, and again, as I said, we'll provide more detail on the underlying financial models. So not only what you can expect over the next 6 months, but the model that we want to get on over the next 2 or 3 years as we progress the turnaround program. So those are just a couple of thoughts on targets and a little more clarity around the walk-through. So everyone understands the adjusted numbers in the baseline, if you will.
So with that, operator, why don't we open it up for questions."

I'm trying to get a little better handle on what I can expect. There are some major changes. I mean, for example, we're reducing dramatically the number of people that have PO authority to get control of our spending. But I don't have any concrete numbers yet as to how that's going to begin to play out month by month. So I would like see that. We've put probably, in our budget for this year, around $500 million to $600 million of those cost savings we have factored into the budget that we've deployed internally. And then part of that is the cost savings, part of that is probably $100 million to $200 million of improvement we'd like to see in our MSS troubled contracts that we just talked about. All that is factored into what we have deployed for the new fiscal year in terms of a budget. What I don't yet have, again, just in total candor is, I don't have any results yet. So I don't know the traction underneath some of these initiatives. That's why I'm saying when we get together in August and again September, I'm going to have a little more facts, and from that, I can begin to extrapolate what I think will play out this fiscal year, then can provide a little more clarity, a little more precision around that. But I want to give you a rough idea of what this looks like in terms of a financial model for fiscal '13. In terms of reinvestment, I don't know. Part of that will be some systems. We obviously have a lot of work to do with our financial systems, and we've got work that's undergoing right now, putting that plan together. So I just don't yet have a precise number of how much will be reinvested. My thinking is, that the majority of this will be dropped to the bottom line."

I mean, it's little things. For example, today, we've put some very skilled contracting people on these deals as they work towards closure. But then often those people that have very good insight around these contracts, we reassign them to other new opportunities. So we actually lose that institutional knowledge around how the contract was structured, where some of the soft spots are in the contract, what the intent was. So one of the little changes that we've made is, we're going to keep those contract people that are part of the close process. They will stay with that contract during the life of the contract. So those are ways that you don't have this interruption of knowledge and an interruption in a handoff that can often contribute to transition services problems. And then as scope changes occur in some of these contracts, you don't have the institutional knowledge to manage that more effectively. So it's little things like that, that allow us to deal prospectively with new business, whereas the troubled contract process deals with things that have already occurred in an effort to remediate this."

However, offsetting the claim, nonrecurring benefit, if you will, next year is the fact that this year no bonuses were paid effectively across the entire corporation. So while we will not experience another claim charge of the magnitude that's referenced here, we hopefully will incur something in the same neighborhood worth the bonus payments across the corporation to a very dedicated work force. So they kind of offset. The iSOFT thing is down in a nice level. Certainly iSOFT's profitability will improve with revenue growth, since you're only looking at 3 quarters' worth. The bulk of the loss this year at iSOFT is predominantly purchase accounting and investments that we're making in some of the systems and the ingestion of iSOFT into CSC. Some of that will occur next year. I don't expect iSOFT to have a $93 million loss next year, but then again, I don't expect it to turn to robust profitability. So we've kind of set iSOFT aside as we continue with the integration and the maturation of the Lorenzo installations around the world. I hope that helps."

And everywhere I went, I found these little nuggets of gold everywhere. And Mike Mancuso, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the big changes we are making is that CSC has been managed as a holding company. So what we find here at headquarters, so what Mike Mancuso found as a CFO in his 3 or 4 years here, by the time he found it, it was often in pretty bad shape because in a holding company mentality, things just sort of roll up and you report what has, in fact, happened. The big transition that we're making is moving to an operating company. And an operating company looks for what the anticipated results are going to be and then operates and tries to change the outcome through management actions and other disciplined processes that are installed. So if I look back over Mike's tenure, I found it very difficult for him to try to manage within a holding company environment, and there's not a great example in the technology industry of a company that really works as a holding company. But as we move and make this transition to an operating company, install enterprise processes like consistent financial systems and consistent product line management systems and consistent sales management systems and consistent HR and compensation and benefit systems, as you begin to make that shift, you have much more visibility to what's going on in the company before it becomes an issue, and therefore, you've got a higher probability of being able to successfully manage better outcomes.

And that, coupled with some of the headwinds we have, particularly in our NPS business, could -- I think, a very probable outcome would be lower revenue, but much higher profitability as we've talked about. Once you get stabilized from a profitability standpoint, and you're executing against a financial model, then I think you can begin to grow the business. You can grow the business organically, you can grow it inorganically, and that really will be the, I think, second phase of the turnaround, is where we begin to grow consistent with the market.

So when you add that all up, we've got 40%, don't hold me to these numbers, but 40% to 50% of our resources are already ""offshore"" and lower cost and Eastern Europe, thank you very much. So I don't think CSC's done a bad job at all. They've done a pretty good job of globalizing their human resource capability around the world. What we haven't done is, we haven't got that focused in a way where it provides as much leverage to our financials and as much leverage to other activities like our development activities, particularly in software, that I would like to see. For example, iSOFT, iSOFT's got a fantastic development center in Chennai. I spent half a day there going through the entire product program. But we haven't gotten that all focused in a way that really leverages the company. So from a pure, do you have people offshore, yes, we do, and it's roughly in line with what many of our competitor's done. But I think the big incremental improvement will be getting that focus and getting that part of our future operating model, so it provides leverage, not only financially, but leverage from a talent standpoint because we've got fantastic talent in many of those geographies."

Thanks for taking some time with us this morning. I am joined by Mike Mancuso, who will cover the numbers. And as you probably know, this will be Mike's last earnings call with CSC as he will be retiring, and I just wanted to thank Mike for, what, almost 4 years of service, somewhat tumultuous, but service, but thank you very much.
And as I think, earlier this week, we announced Mike's successor CFO, Paul Saleh. Paul's recognized and a very much respected CFO for leading brands such as Gannett and Sprint Nextel and Walt Disney International. And he's led global finance functions for companies in the midst of significant change and industry transition, and knows the role that the finance community plays in that type of turnaround environment, and has a long track record of achieving profitability improvements and increasing shareholder value. So Paul will be on board May 23. And I'm sure at that point in time, he will begin to outreach to some of you on the call today.
Let me make a couple remarks before I turn this over to Mike. I've really got 4 key messages this morning. One is that our results are very poor, and they are unacceptable to us at CSC, and they're certainly unacceptable to our investors. The second message is that we are taking immediate actions to begin to move in a different direction. I will cover some of those actions today, and there'll be some more actions in the coming weeks and months. The third message is that although the negatives overwhelmed our results, there are some bright spots, and I do want to highlight some of those bright spots, particularly around some of our new offerings that I think represents the future of the company. And then the final message is that I've now completed a sort of tour of the world and visited many of our sites and many of our clients, many of our investors and many of the analysts that follow CSC, and have a pretty good handle on what the issues are, what the root causes of those issues are. And we are developing a plan to address these, as well as the underlying financial model. And we intend to share that in greater detail when we get together in early September for the Analyst/Investor Day.
So those are the 4 key messages. Now let me just quickly provide a little more detail around each of those messages. And as I said several weeks ago and again today, the results are very poor. The primary reasons for that are the NHS write-offs. The second principal driver was troubled contracts within our MSS business that resulted in impairment and restructuring charges. I don't think we managed our cost structure to adjust for some of these developments as they unrolled themselves throughout the second half of the fiscal year. I think we've got some organizational, what I call operating model alignment issues, which has made execution that much more problematic. And obviously, we continue to see some uncertainty, particularly in the federal sector and in EMEA. So those are the primary causes of the poor results, not substantially different than what we talked about before.
But the second message is, okay, what are we doing about that? So we're taking some immediate actions. One, we're announcing today a $1-billion cost and expense takeout program to be executed over a 12- to 18-month period. Much of that will be delivered to the bottom line. Some will be reinvested in some of the things we need to do internally. But that has now been announced internally, and we are announcing that today.
The second action is a thorough review of our portfolio of contracts. In the past several months, we've now concluded a thorough portfolio review, which involved the systems assurance reviews of all of our outstanding outsourcing contracts. We have identified 40 troubled contracts, the majority of which, around 32, are in our MSS business. And for all of these accounts, we have now implemented or are in the process of implementing remediation actions, including new leadership, transition controls, strong program management disciplines, and this gets monitored on a weekly basis and with me on a monthly basis. And some of the accounts really don't show a clear path to financial health, and in these cases we are intending to either fix them or, in some cases, attempt to renegotiate them.
And to prevent a reoccurrence of what we saw in fiscal '12, we've put a systems assurance program in place. And this team has now reviewed all material contracts, and what I mean by material contracts is anything over $50 million, as well as all the MSS contracts in our backlog. And we want to make sure that with our bookings, particularly in the last half of fiscal '12, we want to ensure that we didn't sign up for more problems, and that we can deliver against these contracts at acceptable profitability. And in terms of new opportunities that are in the pipeline, we have now put a very strong contracting process in place where we review the pricing and the scope before we commit to the contract, again as a way of trying to ensure that we contract at and deliver acceptable profitability.
In terms of NHS, I was over in the U.K. late last week and met with the head of NHS. There's no question we want to -- both parties want to get to this interim agreement and we now are -- on a weekly basis, the head of NHS and myself are getting together to resolve any issues along the lines of the letter of intent which we announced several months ago. So we're hopeful that the NHS interim agreement will get completed in the not-too-distant future. And I think having myself and the head of NHS on the phone every week working through any remaining issues is going to be a helpful management discipline to getting this across the line.
In terms of our operating model, as I said, the lack of clarity and accountability led to or was a contributor to execution issues. I think a lot of our root cause problems do stem from the complexity of our operating model. In many cases, it really lacks the clarity and the accountability that we need, and that severely reduces our ability to act decisively. So we're working to simplify that model so that it is fully aligned and we've got clear lines of accountability. That operating model has been designed. I've covered it with the board, and over the coming weeks and months, we will begin to execute against that.
Another action we've taken is leadership. As you know, we are adding a new leadership talent. Paul Saleh, as I said earlier, was announced as the CFO. But you can expect more management appointments in the coming weeks. In April, we launched a new management compensation program, which aligns our compensation for our top executives to company profitability results, and I think this is a major step towards getting our leaders in line with our shareholders and, again, simplifying some of the operating model clarity issues that we have.
And then finally, we have begun a pretty intensive review of our noncore assets. We are evaluating our portfolio to determine what noncore assets are available for disposal, again, with the goal of delivering incremental cash, as well as improving our profitability along our financial model as we go forward. So those are sort of the list of actions.
I should just mention that this cost takeout program, although substantial at $1 billion, is primarily focused at what I'll call G&A functions: procurement, IT and other G&A functions. It does not affect in any material way our customer-facing resources.
So the turnaround is beginning to take shape. As I said, we have had a chance to speak with all major constituencies. I've had quite a few outside experts in to help with the strategy formulation. I've had the chance, and I'll cover this with my board this week, but there are a couple of elements of the strategy which are becoming very clear. And again, in early September, when we get together, we will fill out more of the details associated with it. But suffice it to say, part of this will revolve around refocusing our portfolio to move up the value chain; a much more precise focus on verticals, on industries that we want to really take a leadership position in and have a lot of intellectual property around to drive that leadership position; a movement to standardize global solutions that can be delivered to any client and delivered profitably, with particular focus on our -- some of our new emerging offerings like cloud and Cyber and our applications and business process services businesses; and much better expansion and leverage of our software assets, which we think are very valuable and that have largely been buried within -- in the company.
So as I said, we're setting a date here for our Investor Day of September 10. We'll share more details at that meeting around our turnaround progress, other actions we are taking, a more detailed review of the strategy, our operating model and the underlying financial model of the company over the next 2 or 3 years, so that you, as our investors and the analysts, can track our progress against that financial model. And you'll be hearing more from us as to the date and the location and so on and so forth.
So just before I turn over to Mike, there are a few bright spots that I'd like to just highlight for a moment. Again, these bright spots were largely overwhelmed by some of the huge issues we had. But for example, our total contract value results were very positive at $19.3 billion. That's a 30% increase over fiscal '11. And the good news is, this came from 150 new commercial clients, as well as successful recompetes and a lot of new scope work for new, as well as existing, clients. And we have more than $28 billion in our qualified pipeline. So I think this really bodes very well and is an indication of CSC's market relevance, as well as the demand for many of our offerings.
And speaking of those offerings, things like our cloud offerings are beginning to gain traction in terms of adoption. In fiscal '12, we recorded $203 million in wins for our commercial cloud services, and we have over $900 million in our qualified pipeline for fiscal '13. So clearly, getting some traction around cloud, and we've recently received some awards on our leadership. So I think that is a very important positive point.
Our Cyber offerings during 2012, we were awarded $48 million in commercial Cyber wins and $350 million in Cyber wins within our NPS business. And the qualified pipeline here, we've got over $700 million of qualified pipeline for our NPS business as we look out in fiscal '13.
And then finally, some of the acquisitions we've made. We're seeing some good traction around the results for iSOFT. We saw revenue of $139 million, the 8 months that they're included in our full year results. But more importantly, we saw some very positive trends in our software license sales and revenues. And we have over 100 go-lives of major iSOFT contracts and projects around the world.
And our AppLabs business that we acquired, that integration is going well. It's becoming a very important part of our end-to-end offering in application services, and we saw about $60 million of revenue in the time that we owned that business. So again, some positive signs around some of the acquisitions that we made.
So that's the comments I want to make. I'll turn it over to Mike, and then I'll come back for a few closing comments, and then we'll open it up to any questions that you might have. Mike?"
263093,204814341,309503,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning to all. My remarks will be brief this morning. As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10.

As Mike Lawrie said, today's results are in line with those contained in our preliminary release on April 10. If you turn to Chart 7, and echoing Mike's commentary, new business bookings are one of our fiscal year '12 bright spots, with awards totaling $19.3 billion. Our backlog now totals $36.4 billion as of March 30. And as you can see from the chart, MSS led the way with $9.5 billion in awards.
Revenue by line of business for the fourth quarter is displayed on Chart 8, with a comparison to last year. Total revenue declined about 2%, largely attributable to our NPS segment. Our commercial business, principally BSS, grew about 1.3% in constant currency and was roughly flat on a GAAP basis.
The operating loss for the quarter, as reflected on Chart 9, is obviously disappointing. Mike Lawrie commented on a number of the macro causes. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, technical challenges on problem contracts in NPS and MSS, coupled with the restructuring charges in MSS and BSS and the expensing of our ongoing work on the NHS contract in BSS, are the main drivers of the operating loss.
Chart 10 is the fourth quarter P&L statement. I would direct your attention to the corporate G&A and net interest expense lines. Legal cost and G&A and a lower cash balance, larger interest payments on capital leases all result in an unfavorable comparison to last year.
Chart 11 summarizes FY '12 results through EPS and reflects a comparison to the EPS numbers contained in our April 10 release. This chart also lays out the revenue, OI and EPS impact of the more significant events within this year.
Focusing on operating income and adjusting FY '12 results for the NHS contract charge and restructuring, the margin would be approximately 2.3%. The statement at the bottom of the chart is intended to highlight the fact that a 32 -- at a 32% tax rate versus our FY '12 roughly 3% tax rate, would have reduced our reported results by about $0.90. This will be important to you as you think about fiscal year '13.
Chart 12 displays selected balance sheet items. Our cash balance versus last year is lower by virtue of the iSOFT and AppLabs acquisitions, as well as lower earnings. The claim settlement and the NHS write-off affected receivables and WIP. The goodwill impairment charge is evident in the lower goodwill balance. Deferred revenue is lower absent any NHS advance payments this year, and of course, the equity number is a result of the above factors.
And finally, on Chart 13, it shows an improvement in days sales outstanding. Removing the uncollected or the unbilled claim balance and the NHS receivables was a big factor in the reduction. The good news is that going forward, we can and should operate at a number well below our historical average.
With that said, now I'm going to turn it back to Mike Lawrie."

Given that we are in a turnaround situation, I don't think it's all that meaningful to provide quarterly targets. As we said in the press release, we are going to issue some annual targets for fiscal '13 at a later date, probably either at our August earnings call, or the very latest when we get together in September. I'd just like a little more time to understand some of the financial impact of the turnaround activities that I have already announced.
But given the results that Mike just covered, here's how I would think about fiscal '13. Due to the continued budget uncertainty, particularly in the federal space, I think we expect our revenue in NPS to most likely decline by mid-single digits. So think of this as sort of a 3% to 5% kind of decline. On the commercial side, we anticipate flat revenue, primarily due to some of the headwinds we see, but also we are clearly going to focus on profitability in the near term. So we are not going to sign business just for the sake of signing business, but to drive improvements in profitability.
With respect to our operating margin, the improvement initiatives that I talked about earlier in this call should generate somewhere in the neighborhood of 200- to 300-basis-points improvement over the adjusted fiscal '12 numbers in the walk-through that Mike just took you through. We do expect the tax rate, our normal tax rate, around 32% in fiscal '13, and then EPS can be fairly easily derived from those other inputs on the other variables. So we'll continue to work on the forecast, and again, as I said, we'll provide more detail on the underlying financial models. So not only what you can expect over the next 6 months, but the model that we want to get on over the next 2 or 3 years as we progress the turnaround program. So those are just a couple of thoughts on targets and a little more clarity around the walk-through, so everyone understands the adjusted numbers in the baseline, if you will.
So with that, operator, why don't we open it up for questions?"

I'm trying to get a little better handle on what I can expect. There are some major changes. I mean, for example, we're reducing dramatically the number of people that have PO authority to get control of our spending. But I don't have any concrete numbers yet as to how that's going to begin to play out month by month. So I would like to see that. We've put probably, in our budget for this year, around $500 million to $600 million of those cost savings we have factored into the budget that we've deployed internally. And then part of that is the cost savings. Part of that is probably $100 million to $200 million of improvement we'd like to see in our MSS troubled contracts that we just talked about. All that is factored into what we have deployed for the new fiscal year in terms of a budget. What I don't yet have, again, just in total candor, is I don't have any results yet. So I don't know the traction underneath some of these initiatives. That's why I'm saying when we get together in August and again September, I'm going to have a little more facts, and from that, I can begin to extrapolate what I think will play out this fiscal year, then can provide a little more clarity, a little more precision around that. But I want to give you a rough idea of what this looks like in terms of a financial model for fiscal '13. In terms of reinvestment, I don't know. Part of that will be some systems. We obviously have a lot of work to do with our financial systems, and we've got work that's undergoing right now, putting that plan together. So I just don't yet have a precise number of how much will be reinvested. My thinking is that the majority of this will be dropped to the bottom line."

I mean, it's little things. For example, today, we've put some very skilled contracting people on these deals as they work towards closure. But then often those people that have very good insight around these contracts, we reassign them to other new opportunities. So we actually lose that institutional knowledge around how the contract was structured, where some of the soft spots are in the contract, what the intent was. So one of the little changes that we've made is, we're going to keep those contract people that are part of the close process. They will stay with that contract through the life of the contract. So those are ways that you don't have this interruption of knowledge and an interruption in a handoff that can often contribute to transition services problems. And then as scope changes occur in some of these contracts, you don't have the institutional knowledge to manage that more effectively. So it's little things like that, that allow us to deal prospectively with new business, whereas the troubled contract process deals with things that have already occurred in an effort to remediate them."

However, offsetting the claim, nonrecurring benefit, if you will, next year is the fact that this year no bonuses were paid effectively across the entire corporation. So while we will not experience another claim charge of the magnitude that's referenced here, we hopefully will incur something in the same neighborhood worth of bonus payments across the corporation to a very dedicated work force. So they kind of offset. The iSOFT thing is down into noise level. Certainly iSOFT's profitability will improve with revenue growth, since you're only looking at 3 quarters' worth. The bulk of the loss this year at iSOFT is predominantly purchase accounting and investments that we're making in some of the systems and the ingestion of iSOFT into CSC. Some of that will occur next year. I don't expect iSOFT to have a $93-million loss next year, but then again, I don't expect it to turn to robust profitability. So we've kind of set iSOFT aside as we continue with the integration and the maturation of the Lorenzo installations around the world. I hope that helps."

And everywhere I went, I found these little nuggets of gold everywhere. And, Mike Mancuso, correct me if I'm wrong: one of the big changes we are making is that CSC has been managed as a holding company. So what we find here at headquarters, so what Mike Mancuso found as a CFO in his 3 or 4 years here, by the time he found it, it was often in pretty bad shape because in a holding company mentality, things just sort of roll up and you report what has, in fact, happened. The big transition that we're making is moving to an operating company. And an operating company looks for what the anticipated results are going to be and then operates and tries to change the outcome through management actions and other disciplined processes that are installed. So if I look back over Mike's tenure, I found it very difficult for him to try to manage within a holding company environment, and there's not a great example in the technology industry of a company that really works as a holding company. But as we move and make this transition to an operating company, install enterprise processes like consistent financial systems and consistent product line management systems and consistent sales management systems and consistent HR and compensation and benefit systems -- as you begin to make that shift, you have much more visibility to what's going on in the company before it becomes an issue, and therefore, you've got a higher probability of being able to successfully manage better outcomes. So I don't want to put words in your mouth, Mike, but that's a fundamental shift in how we're going to run the business."

I mean, is there a scenario here, Mike, where ultimately you shrink the company from a revenue perspective, but drive higher levels of profitability with less risk across the portfolio? Is that a potential outcome here? Or do you think that some tangible level of consistent top line growth will be the byproduct of your turnaround over the next couple of years?"

And when we do get together in September, I'll outline this. But fundamentally, yes, I do think this company could shrink a little bit in terms of revenue over the next year to 18 months as we prune some unprofitable or less profitable pieces of the portfolio, absolutely. And again, for the next year or so, we are going to be majoring more on profitability than we are on revenue growth. And that, coupled with some of the headwinds we have, particularly in our NPS business, could -- I think, a very probable outcome would be lower revenue, but much higher profitability as we've talked about. Once you get stabilized from a profitability standpoint, and you're executing against a financial model, then I think you can begin to grow the business. You can grow the business organically; you can grow it inorganically; and that really will be the, I think, second phase of the turnaround, is where we begin to grow consistent with the market. But we're able to grow, we're able to integrate, so that we don't have these huge execution gaps that result in deteriorating profitability.

Welcome to CSC's first quarter 2013 earnings call and webcast. This morning, CSC issued our earnings release, and I do hope you do have a chance to review that document.
On the call with me today are Mike Lawrie, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer.
As usual, this call is being webcast at csc.com, and we've also posted slides to the website, which will accompany our discussion. 
On Slide 2, some of the matters which we discuss on the call will be forward-looking. Just keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed during the call. A discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
On Slide 3, we acknowledge that CSC's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which
we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provided a reconciliation of these metrics in the most respective and mostly comparable GAAP metrics. These reconciliations can be found in the tables of today's earnings release and in an appendix to our website.
Both documents are available for your review within the Investor Relations section of the website.
Finally, I'd like to remind our listeners that CSC assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call, except, of course, as required by law.
Moving to the next slide, I'd like to introduce Mike Lawrie."

Thanks, Steve, and welcome everyone, and thank you for your interest in CSC, and joining us this morning. As Steve said, I am joined here by Paul Saleh. I really have 4 messages that I would like to leave you with this morning. And then I'll develop each of those messages in a little more detail. But first, we are beginning to see some early signs of an improving financial performance. The second key message is that we are putting some very strong turnaround actions in place and are beginning to execute against those actions. The third message is we still have, as I've said many times, a lot of work ahead of us to be done, and we do see some market uncertainties. And the fourth key message I'd like to leave you with this morning is that we are trying to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and to try to clear up as much of the ambiguity around our performance as we possibly can.
So I'm going to delve into a little more detail on those messages, and then I'm going to turn it over to Paul, who will go through a little more detail in the first quarter results. And then as always, we'll open it up for some questions and answers.
So let me just develop the first key message here that we are beginning to see some early signs of improving financial performance. One, our sales were very good in the first quarter. We had new business awards of $4 billion, which were significantly better than the same period a year ago, up 74%, with very strong signings in our MSS business, $2.2 billion. And that included 20 new logos or 20 new customers.
One of the major contracts we signed was with Ostom [ph], which is a world leader in power generation. And I'm singling this out because this is a very large cloud and global infrastructure services win for us. I think it begins to validate our increasing strength in cloud computing.
Revenue was up around 1% in constant currency to about $3.96 billion. As we had anticipated, the commercial growth that we saw in the quarter was offset by a decline in our MPS segment. For the full year, I continue to expect MPS revenue will probably decline by mid-single digits, as we talked about before. And on the commercial side, we expect sort of flattish revenues, primarily due to some of the market headwinds but also resulting from our increased focus on profitability and our increased focus on our portfolio of contracts.
We also reported very strong improvements to our cash flow. Free cash flow was a negative $25 million, which is about a $378 million improvement year-on-year. This improvement came primarily through a higher cash flow from operations, improved working capital, but also reflected the fact that we made substantially less bonus payment in the first quarter.
Profitability was solid. We really are beginning to realize some improvements from our focus on contract management discipline, as well as some early initial returns from our cost takeout program. Our operating margins of 4.6% showed a strong sequential increase and a slight year-over-year increase.
MSS margins showed a marked improvement, again primarily due to our contract discipline on many of our focused contracts. Our NPS margins were slightly down, and the BSS margins declined year-on-year.
In many meetings I've had with you, many of you on the phone today, I know there has been some confusion of relating to CSC's fiscal year '12 baseline of profitability. And as a result, our plans for improvement off of that baseline, Paul is going through that a little more detail today, and necessary again, when we get together on September 10. But I just wanted to reiterate that we are continuing to target a 200 to 300 basis point improvement to our operating margin before corporate G&A. So no change to that target.
And then, finally, from a financial standpoint, our earnings per share were $0.26, which we were pleased to see and largely a result of the aforementioned items.
The second key message I wanted to leave you with today is that we are taking some very strident, strong actions that we are beginning to execute on against our turnaround plan. 1 is our troubled contracts or focused contracts. I think, as we've spoken in the past, we identified 35 to 40 contracts that were under performing and that we were focused on. And since that time, our focus has really resulted in significant improvement across many of these accounts. We implemented remediation actions for all the accounts. And in some instances, these actions include new leadership transition controls, stronger program management disciplines. And as I said before, this is monitored on a weekly basis. And there has not been a lot of change to that list, which is good news. So we're still focused on the same ones and don't have a lot of new ones coming on to that list. And additionally, a lot of the new contracts that we have signed or all the new contracts that we signed in the first quarter were beginning to follow the same disciplined program management approach. So we're getting comfortable that the new contracts that we are signing are adhering to the disciplines that we are applying to those contract that we are focused on as underperforming.
We've made good progress with NHS. We're continuing to work with NHS. And during the quarter, CSC achieved a key milestone with Lorenzo care management software. We delivered this new software to 3 trusts in the United Kingdom. And as a result of making that milestone, NHS has agreed to pay us for that milestone. So that's very good news, as we continue to move forward with NHS.
The billion dollar cost takeout program that we have talked about in the past, we have initiated this cost takeout plan. We expect to realize this $1 billion over roughly an 18 month period of time. And this plan includes not only the contract performance, which I just mentioned, but also a whole series of other costs and expense actions. And Paul will take you through that in a little more detail.
We've also, as part of our turnaround efforts, simplified our operating model and have brought a lot of new leadership into CSC. So we have now begun the initial implementation phases of a much simpler and clear operating model that will allow us to respond much more quickly to market change and client needs, make decisions faster as well as reduce cost and inefficiencies that were in the previous operating model.
On, I think, our previous earnings call, I indicated that you could expect more management changes. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to attract some fantastic talent to our top leadership team. As you know, Paul Saleh has joined us as CFO. Sunita Holzer, our Chief Human Resources Officer; Gary Zelinski is the Head of our Infrastructure business. Earlier this week, we announced that Tom Hogan is the new President of our Application Services. And we promoted Dave Gillette to be the President of our NPS segment. So significant changes to the top leadership team here. And I'm very, very pleased with the level of talent that we have been able to attract to CSC.
When we get together on September 10, I'm going to share more details about the new operating model, what our intentions are in terms of standardizing many of our service offerings and our ability to scale those on a more global basis, as well as our transition to cloud computing, our investment efforts around cyber security and the standardized global processes and support functions that will drive greater efficiency, help us take cost out of the business and also improve our go to market model. So we will go in much greater detail on some of these turnaround actions when we get together on September 10.
The final message is, as I said -- not the final message, but we still have a lot of work to do here. We've taken some strong actions on many fronts. I think the first quarter reflects some of those earlier returns. There is a lot to be done, but I am encouraged by the improvements, and I am most encouraged by the enthusiasm and the passion and the energy that the CSC employees are putting behind this collective effort to get our business on a different trajectory. So we are executing with urgency. We do continue to see some headwinds out there, most notably Europe and in the federal government in Europe, we are beginning to see some impact, particularly to our consulting business. As you know, we've taken steps to restructure our business operations in the U.K., in the Nordics and in Germany to reflect some of the headwinds that we anticipate, as we go through this fiscal year.
On the federal side of our business, we clearly are seeing delays in award decisions, as in many of our competitors and other participants in this industry. And we expect that this continuing resolution and the potential impact of sequestration will continue to create an environment of uncertainty for many of our federal customers, and that will cause some delays in contract signing.
So those are the 2 primary headwinds we see as we go through this fiscal year.
The final message before I turn this over to Paul is that we want to be very clear and very transparent about our performance, about our accounting and about our business.
With respect to the audit committee, independent investigation into our accounting errors, the committee has determined that that independent investigation is complete. Since the filing of our fiscal 2012 10-K, the independent investigation did not identify any new accounting errors, although our 10-Q will identify certain items that management believes could result in immaterial changes in the amount allocation of period adjustments for fiscal 2013 and prior years. So the independent investigation has been completed. We will continue, of course, to work with the SEC investigation and are cooperating fully as that goes forward.
Paul will -- when I turn this over to him in a couple seconds here, we'll articulate our baseline performance for fiscal '12 results. There were some confusion over that. And I think this will provide a much clear starting point so that you can measure and track our financial performance as we go through this year.
I think the baseline will be important as we describe the financial targets for each of the stages of our turnaround program, when we get together at our Investor Day in New York in September.
But again, our goal here is to be clear and as transparent as possible so that you have a full understanding of our plan and contract our progress and challenges as we go forward. So with that, Paul, I will turn it over to you."

We have great offset to build on. We have a strong and loyal customer base and unique intellectual property across many of our businesses.

We have a strong and loyal customer base and unique intellectual property across many of our businesses. As Mike mentioned, in the coming months, we'll be sharing with you more details about our plans to reduce the company's cost structure, improve our performance and strengthen our financial position. But today, my comments will focus on the first quarter results. And I'll also discuss our liquidity and our cash flow position. And I will comment on our $1 billion cost takeout program and provide greater clarity around our fiscal 2012 baseline EPS and margins and provide some fiscal 2013 outlook.
So on the next slide, let me begin with our first quarter results. They are summarized on Slide 10. We reported revenues of approximately $4 billion, which is up 1% on a constant currency basis. Our operating margins in the quarter were 4.6%, relatively in line with the prior year but up strongly sequentially. EPS was $0.26 per share compared with $0.41 last year. Last year was adjusted to exclude a one-time tax benefit.
Our tax rate in the quarter was close to 43% due to our mix of earnings and the impact of foreign earnings coming from jurisdictions, where we have a valuation allowance. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%.
Our free cash flow was negative $25 million in the quarter, but that is $378 million better than last year, and I'll have more to say on that later.
On the next slide, let me turn to our segment results, starting with our Public Sector business. Our total NPS revenues were $1.37 billion for the quarter and represent 34% of our total company revenues.
Revenues from Department of Defense contract accounted for 67% of NPS revenues in the quarter and were down 9% year-over-year, primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year.
Revenue from civil agencies accounted for 29% of NPS revenues. Civil revenues declined 4% primarily due to reduced scope on existing contract and the timing of certain contractual milestones. But for the full year, we still expect NPS to be down mid-single digits, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets.
NPS operating income was $101 million in the quarter and operating margins was 7.4%.
Net NPS bookings of $900 million were in line with a year-ago period, and about 43% of those bookings came through our IDIQ contract vehicles.
Turning now to our Managed Services segment, which is on the next slide. Revenues were $1.64 billion and accounted for 41% of the company's total revenues. Revenues in MSS were up 1% year-over-year, and up nearly 5% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagement and the acquisition of AppLabs, which help offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income of $95 million increased by $86 million compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by significant improvement in the performance of our focused list of contracts, which partially offset a workforce restructuring charge of $13 million in the quarter.
Operating margin rebounded to 5.8%. MSS bookings of $2.2 billion were substantially better than a year ago due to new contracts such as Osterholm and, Mike mentioned that, as well as contract awards from leading financial services in the U.S. and the important contract award in Europe.
Turning to our Business Solutions & Services  segment. Our BSS revenues were $985 million in the quarter or 25% of the total company's revenues. BSS revenues increased 2.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant currency, as a result of the iSOFT acquisition and revenue growth from NHS. iSOFT contributed $54 million during the quarter. And CSC has successfully deployed, as Mike mentioned, the Lorenzo care management software at 3 NHS trusts.
BSS operating income was $16 million. That was a decline of $41 million year-over-year. That was due to iSOFT dilution of $28 million and a workforce restructuring charge of $14 million. Operating margin was 1.6% in the quarter.
Our BSS bookings of about $900 million were in line with a year-ago period, where virtually all of these contracts came from new customers.
Let me move on to our cash flow performance in the quarter. On the next slide, you can see that our fee cash flow was negative $25 million compared with a negative $403 million in the prior year. Free cash flow improved primarily due to working capital performance. CapEx was down $123 million year-over-year, as a result of tighter discipline around capital spending.
On the next slide, we have highlighted a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3.2 billion, down about $700 million from a year ago. As a result, our DSOs were 72 days, an improvement of 15 days year-over-year.  About half the improvement was due to a settlement of claims with the U.S. government, but the remainder stemming from operational improvements across the company, including better collections.
Now our DSO, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 42 days. Our debt maturities schedule is also shown on the slide. We have $300 million of term notes coming due in February and $700 million maturing in March of 2013. We have $1 billion of cash on hand, as I mentioned earlier. $316 million of that cash is in the U.S., $684 million is offshore.
I want to stress that the substantial amount of the cash held outside the U.S. can be made available to us in the U.S. through the settlement of intercompany loans in a tax effective manner.
While we also have access to the capital market, as well as access to our $1.5 billion credit facility, which is undrawn, which all of these gives us ample financial flexibility to address the upcoming debt maturities.
Next, on the following slide, I will comment briefly on our progress to take $1 billion out of our cost structure over the next 18 months. Our focusing on the number of areas, which we've listed on this slide. First, we expect continued improvement from our focused list contracts, develop an economic plan for each of these contracts to improve the performance. Our results in the first quarter clearly show that we're off to a great start.
Our objective is to achieve $100 million to $200 million improvement in profitability in fiscal 2013.
Another area of opportunity is in sourcing and procurement. We are following a two-pronged approach to extract greater savings there. We're consolidating our procurement spending with fewer vendors and we're negotiating better terms with those vendors. We are also instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors. And we're ensuring that purchases are only made when needed or required contractually.
Third, we have efforts underway to optimize our workforce utilization. We've taken actions already in the quarter in select markets to restructure our workforce, and we're looking at opportunities to better leverage our low-cost, offshore resources.
Now IT rationalization should also lead to cost savings as we standardize our IT tools and systems. And we believe our greater G&A efficiencies are there and should contribute to our savings target as we implement efforts to consolidate our real estate footprint also across the company.
Now the collective impact of these activities should be $500 million to $600 million reductions to our cost structure in 2013 -- fiscal 2013, and most of these savings should fall to the bottom line.
Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to clarify CSC's baseline performance for 2012. On the current slide, we've adjusted fiscal 2012 results for special items. On that basis, EPS for fiscal 2012 would have been $0.67 with an operating margin of 3.4% and an EBIT margin of 2%. Now you can refer to the appendix for a reconciliation of those -- for those numbers.
For fiscal 2013, we expect improvement of 200 to 300 basis points to operating and EBIT margins, consistent with what we shared with you previously.
Improvement is driven by our $500 million to $600 million cost take-out program, and will be partially offset by a combination of customer committed savings and reinvestments in the business.
As a result, we are targeting an EPS of $2.10 to $2.30 for the year, and we're assuming a tax rate of 32% to 36%. We're also targeting free cash flow in the range of $300 million to $350 million.
So in summary, we're off to a good start for the year. We have a number of actions underway to improve our profitability and cash flow. We still have challenging road ahead, but we are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing in our transformation journey. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments."

What we need to do is utilize them more. That's one of the reasons why we have made a change to our global infrastructure business, because our global infrastructure business was very regionalized.

They figured out how to get a better return on investment capital and they figured out how to run their operations more efficiently so they can expand their margins. And I think we, at CSC, aspire to be more like those winning competitors in the market rather than try to continually explain why we are different. We do have a federal business, as you know. There's a top end to what we can do from a profitability standpoint before you attract a lot of attention. But yes, that's all real.

We're not seeing a lot of new problem accounts. We're always going to have some problem accounts. You know it as much as I do, but not 35 or 40 of them at the same time. So we are not seeing a lot of new ones. And I attribute that primarily to the fact that we are managing this much more diligently from the very beginning. So a lot of the transition services that we provide for example, we're spending a lot of more time and focus on understanding what the risk factors are and mitigating those risks before we start the contract. We're making sure that we have qualified project managers and account executives on these big deals before we get started. If we're doing a contract that are somewhat new to us on a new geography, we are supplementing the local team with experts from around the company that have had that experience. So all of that is what I sum up around the whole contracting and delivery discipline process. And as a result of that, we are beginning to tackle some of these issues before they become -- before they become issues. In terms of the total numbers, 35 or 40, what does that represent in terms of total revenue to the company?

I mean, the truth is, from my perspective, CSC had very good processes and procedures in place. In my analysis, for whatever reason, they stopped following those processes and procedures in a disciplined way. And I think that occurred, Rod, when we began to move from a global delivery approach to a regional delivery approach. We fractured that and not only did we not follow those same disciplined processes, but the information that was flowing more of these fragmented basis was much more difficult to collate and get together quickly so that you can respond before you have problems. So as I said, we've made substantial changes in how we manage stuff. So we have a deal qualification process. It requires very strict approvals from our industry people, our salespeople as well as the offerings people. And we are absolutely enforcing that discipline. There's a pre-bid review and approval. So we're not getting into bids that we just are not comfortable that we have the skills or the capability to deliver against or we just don't like the margins. And then, once we are successful on closing business, and you saw this quarter we closed quite a bit of business, then we immediately move into the contract execution process. So people that were part of the capture team, the people who were part of the contract negotiation, now will stay with that contract as we begin to move into the execution phase. So it is not one thing that caused these problems. It was a number of things that got out of sync that needed to be brought back in, needed to have a full transparency, put sunshine on them and make sure that we manage them with a much greater sense of discipline.

And if he would do that bid, I'm going to ask him to come down and have that discussion with my board. So we went back out, we bid at the higher lever we want. So part of this is just sticking to your guns and feeling confident that you understand your cost and you understand what your cost of capital is, and you articulate that in the bid and why you're bidding what you're bidding, and making sure that you have the right cost recovery plans in place in the contract, in the execution of the delivery so that you can deliver against that economic game plan. So I think there are cases where we're probably not bidding or we're losing because we are not as competitive as right now. Overtime, as we take this cost out, we improve this margin, this allows us more pricing flexibility. And that will then allow us to compete for more deals in the marketplace. This quarter, we had very good signs, but a lot of that was carried over from some large deals that did not close last year that happened to close this year. So these booking numbers are notoriously lumpy as you go through the year. The most important thing is that we're much more focused on booking business than we're comfortable we can execute on and we can make an adequate return as opposed to just chasing revenue for revenue's sake."

Ultimately, going back to an earlier question that was asked, what do you think the steady state returns are in this company. In order to get to a much more competitive position with some of the key leaders in the industry, yes, we will need revenue growth. So you can't save your weight to prosperity. But where we are in the first phase of this turnaround, we can make some significant improvements in our operating performance just by managing ourselves more effectively. But ultimately, you must get revenue growth. I'm a big believer that until you have a foundation in place, that you got confidence in, that you can execute and you can deliver against, it doesn't do you any good to grow, grow, grow, if you're not on strong foundation because all you do is create bigger and bigger problems. And to some extent, that has what happened to CSC. It's chasing TCV and chasing revenue without the firm foundation in place to deliver against them."

We got very clear line of sight on the savings that will be generated as a result of the restructuring charges we took towards the end of last year and some of the restructuring charges that we ran through the P&L in the last quarter. We have very good visibility on that. And I have a high, high degree of confidence that that will be executed. We've got pretty good line of sight against what we want to do from procurement. I don't have as much confidence that we'll be able to get all that done because that revolves around negotiating with vendors. It requires putting new processes in place where you consolidate buying, et cetera, et cetera. So we've identified it. I have a little less confidence in that. In terms of the goals that we set for profit improvement on our contracts, I've got great visibility into what contracts there are, what we're trying to do. And overtime, I will develop some confidence that we'll be able to execute against that. So I think it's a balanced view. I feel pretty good about that we identified what we need to identify.

I have little less confidence until I see more results around the contract performance and around some of the procurement savings we'd like to make. Paul, do want you to add to that?"

And we are working pretty close to getting towards a tenant agreement with NHS. Now once that gets done, we still have to have the government approval. So think of that as a cabinet office and so on and so forth, the U.K. government. Let me be clear, we do not have any approval at that level. But we have been working very very hard, making sure we've got definition on what the offering is going to be, definition on the pricing for that offering will be, definition of all the outstanding puts and takes so that each side has been claiming and talking about. We've got very good agreement on that. We've got a lot of work that we've done on the forward approval process and trust come into the NHS to get approval on their project so that they can be funded by NHS that requires approval process. We made a great deal of progress on that. So I think we are making very good progress on this and I'm optimistic that we'll be able at some point in time to conclude, but we have not included as of today. Currently, we got about 200 or so in the U.K. that are an expense to us, that we do not have revenue to offset that expense. And we're running that through the P&L. We are not capitalizing on that. That's in our results this quarter. And yes, there is a certain period of time where you say, if you can't get to a contract, what are you going to do with those people? We have the demand for iSOFT in other parts of the world. We have -- I have been reluctant to disband that U.K. team until we get to some conclusion because once you disband them, you don't get them back together. So once some go here or there to support other projects, you don't get them back. But I'm quite comfortable that those people can be quickly deployed against revenue producing opportunities. Either we get to a contract, if we can utilize those people, we begin to actively sell the U.K. market, we begin to generate revenue, we begin to make money or we don't. And as you know, we took most of those charges. So I don't anticipate that we have any large cash charges associated with expanding those people if that would be the point that we got to."

Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for your interest in CSC, and joining us this morning. As Steve said, I am joined here by Paul Saleh. I really have 4 messages that I would like to leave you with this morning. And then I'll develop each of those messages in a little more detail. But first, we are beginning to see some early signs of an improving financial performance. The second key message is that we are putting some very strong turnaround actions in place and are beginning to execute against those actions. The third message is we still have, as I've said many time, a lot of work ahead of us to be done, and we do see some market uncertainties. And that the fourth key message I'd like to leave you with this morning is that we are trying to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and to try to clear up as much of the ambiguity around our performance as we possibly can.
So I'm going to delve into a little more detail on those messages, and then I will turn it over to Paul, who will go through a little more detail of the first quarter results. And then as always, we'll open it up for some questions and answers.
So let me just develop the first key message here that we are beginning to see some early signs of improving financial performance. One, our sales were very good in the first quarter. We had new business awards of $4 billion, which were significantly better than the same period a year ago, up 74%, with very strong signings. In our MSS business, $2.2 billion, and that included 20 new logos or 20 new customers.
One of the major contracts we signed was with Alstom, which is a world leader in power generation. And this is -- I'm singling this out because this was a very large cloud and global infrastructure services win for us. And I think it begins to validate our increasing strength in cloud computing.
Revenue was up around 1% in constant currency to about $3.96 billion. As we had anticipated, the commercial growth that we saw in the quarter was offset by a decline in our NPS segment. For the full year, I continue to expect NPS revenue will probably decline by mid-single digits, as we've talked about before. And on the commercial side, we expect sort of flattish revenues, primarily due to some of the market headwinds, but also resulting from our increased focus on profitability and our increased focus on our portfolio of contracts.
We also reported very strong improvements to our cash flow. Free cash flow was a negative $25 million, which is about a $378 million improvement year-on-year. This improvement came primarily through a higher cash flow from operations, improved working capital, but also reflected the fact that we made substantially less bonus payments in the first quarter.
Profitability was solid. We really are beginning to realize some improvements from our focus on contract management discipline, as well as some early initial returns from our cost takeout program. Operating margins of 4.6% showed a strong sequential increase and a slight year-over-year increase.
MSS margins showed a marked improvement, again primarily due to our contract discipline on many of our focused contracts. NPS margins were slightly down, and the BSS margins declined year-on-year.
In many meetings I've had with you, many of you on the phone today, I know there has been some confusion of relating to CSC's fiscal year '12 baseline of profitability. And as a result, our plans for improvement off of that baseline, Paul is going to go through that in little more detail today, and then if necessary again, when we get together on September 10. But I just wanted to reiterate that we are continuing to target a 200 to 300 basis point improvement to our operating margin before corporate G&A. So no change to that -- with that target.
And then, finally, from a financial standpoint, our earnings per share were $0.26, which we were pleased to see and largely a result of the aforementioned items.
The second key message I wanted to leave you with today is that we are taking some very strident, strong actions that we're beginning to execute on against our turnaround plan. One is our troubled contracts or focused contracts. I think, as we've spoken in the past, we identified 35 to 40 contracts that were underperforming and that we were focused on. And since that time, our focus has really resulted in significant improvement across many of these accounts. We've implemented remediation actions for all the accounts. And in some instances, these actions include new leadership, transition controls, stronger program management disciplines. And as I said before, this is monitored on a weekly basis. And there has not been a lot of change to that list, which is good news. So we're still focused on the same ones and don't have a lot of new ones coming on to that list. And additionally, a lot of the new contracts that we have signed, or all the new contracts that we've signed in the first quarter, were beginning to follow the same disciplined program management approach. So we're getting comfortable that the new contracts that we are signing are adhering to the disciplines that we are applying to those contracts that we are focused on as underperforming.
We made good progress with NHS. We're continuing to work with NHS. And during the quarter, CSC achieved a key milestone with Lorenzo care management software. We delivered this new software to 3 trusts in the United Kingdom. And as a result of making that milestone, NHS has agreed to pay us for that milestone. So that's very good news as we continue to move forward with NHS.
The billion dollar cost takeout program that we have talked about in the past, we have initiated this cost takeout plan. We expect to realize this $1 billion over roughly an 18-month period of time. And this plan includes not only the contract performance, which I just mentioned, but also a whole series of other cost and expense actions. And Paul will take you through that in a little more detail.
We've also, as part of our turnaround efforts, simplified our operating model and have brought a lot of new leadership into CSC. So we have now begun the initial implementation phases of a much simpler and clear operating model that will allow us to respond much more quickly to market change and client needs, make decisions faster, as well as reduce costs and inefficiencies that were in the previous operating model.
On, I think, our previous earnings call, I'd indicated that you could expect more management changes. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to attract some fantastic talent to our top leadership team. As you know, Paul Saleh's joined us as CFO; Sunita Holzer is our Chief Human Resource Officer; Gary Budzinski is the Head of our infrastructure business. Earlier this week, we announced that Tom Hogan is the new President of our application services. And we promoted Dave Zolet to be the President of our NPS segment. So significant changes to the top leadership team here, and very, very pleased with the level of talent that we have been able to attract to CSC.
When we get together on September 10, I'm going to share more details about the new operating model, what our intentions are in terms of standardizing many of our services offerings and our ability to scale those on a more global basis, as well as our transition to cloud computing, our investment efforts around cyber security and the standardized global processes and support functions that will drive greater efficiency, help us take cost out of the business and also improve our go-to-market model. So we will go in much greater detail on some of these turnaround actions when we get together on September 10.
The final message is, as I say, we still -- or not the final message, but we still have a lot of work to do here. We've taken some strong actions on many fronts. I think the first quarter reflects some of those earlier returns. There's a lot to be done, but I am encouraged by the improvements. And I am most encouraged by the enthusiasm and the passion and the energy that the CSC employees are putting behind this collective effort to get our business on a different trajectory. So we're executing with urgency. We do continue to see some headwinds out there, most notably Europe. And in the federal government in Europe, we are beginning to see some impact, particularly to our consulting business. As you know, we've taken steps to restructure our business operations in the U.K., in the Nordics and in Germany to reflect some of the headwinds that we anticipate as we go through this fiscal year.
On the federal side of our business, we clearly are seeing delays in award decisions, as are many of our competitors and other participants in this industry. And we expect that this continuing resolution and the potential impact of sequestration will continue to create an environment of uncertainty for many of our federal customers, and that will cause some delays in contract signing.
So those are the 2 primary headwinds we see as we go through this fiscal year.
The final message before I turn this over to Paul is that we want to be very clear and very transparent about our performance, about our accounting and about our business.
With respect to the audit committee's independent investigation into our accounting errors, the committee has determined that, that independent investigation is complete. Since the filing of our fiscal 2012 10-K, the independent investigation did not identify any new accounting errors, although our 10-Q will identify certain items that management believes could result in immaterial changes in the amount and allocation of period adjustments for fiscal 2013 in prior years. So the independent investigation has been completed. We'll continue, of course, to work with the SEC investigation and are cooperating fully as that goes forward.
Paul will, when I turn this over to him in a couple seconds here, will articulate our baseline performance for fiscal '12 results. There was some confusion over that. And I think this will provide a much clear starting point so that you can measure and track our financial performance as we go through this year.
I think the baseline will be important as we describe the financial targets for each of the stages of our turnaround program when we get together at our Investor Day in New York in September.
But again, our goal here is to be clear and as transparent as possible so that you have a full understanding of our plan and can track our progress and challenges as we go forward. So with that, Paul, I will turn it over to you."

We have a strong and loyal customer base and unique intellectual property across many of our businesses. As Mike mentioned, in the coming months, we'll be sharing with you more details about our plans to reduce the company's cost structure, improve our performance and strengthen our financial position. But today, my comments will focus on the first quarter results, and I'll also discuss our liquidity and our cash flow position. And I will comment on our $1 billion cost takeout program and provide greater clarity around our fiscal 2012 baseline EPS and margins and provide some fiscal 2013 outlook.
So on the next slide, let me begin with our first quarter results. They're summarized on Slide 10. We reported revenues of approximately $4 billion, which is up 1% on a constant currency basis. Our operating margins in the quarter were 4.6%, relatively in line with the prior year but up strongly sequentially. EPS was $0.26 per share compared with $0.41 last year. Last year was adjusted to exclude a one-time tax benefit.
Our tax rate in the quarter was close to 43% due to our mix of earnings and the impact of foreign earnings coming from jurisdictions, where we have a valuation allowance. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%.
Our free cash flow was negative $25 million in the quarter, but that is $378 million better than last year. And I'll have more to say on that later.
On the next slide, let me turn to our segment results, starting with our public sector business. Our total NPS revenues were $1.37 billion for the quarter and represent 34% of our total company revenues.
Revenues from Department of Defense contract accounted for 67% of NPS revenues in the quarter and were down 9% year-over-year, primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year.
Revenue from civil agencies accounted for 29% of NPS revenues. Civil revenues declined 4% primarily due to reduced scope on existing contract and the timing of certain contractual milestones. But for the full year, we still expect NPS to be down mid-single digits, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets.
NPS operating income was $101 million in the quarter and operating margins was 7.4%.
Net NPS bookings of $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, and about 43% of those bookings came through our IDIQ contract vehicles.
Turning now to our Managed Services segment, which is on the next slide. Revenues were $1.64 billion and accounted for 41% of the company's total revenues. Revenues in MSS were up 1% year-over-year, and up nearly 5% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the acquisition of AppLabs, which helped to offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income of $95 million increased by $86 million compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by significant improvement in the performance of our focused list of contracts, which partially offset a workforce restructuring charge of $13 million in the quarter.
Operating margin rebounded to 5.8%. MSS bookings of $2.2 billion were substantially better than a year ago due to new contracts such as Alstom, and Mike mentioned that, as well as contract award from leading financial service providers in the U.S. and an important contract award in Europe.
Turning to our Business Solutions & Services segment. Our BSS revenues were $985 million in the quarter, or 25% of the total company's revenues. BSS revenues increased 2.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant currency, as a result of the iSOFT acquisition and revenue growth from NHS. iSOFT contributed $54 million during the quarter. And CSC successfully deployed, as Mike mentioned, the Lorenzo care management software at 3 NHS trusts.
BSS operating income was $16 million. That was a decline of $41 million year-over-year. That was due to iSOFT dilution of $28 million and a workforce restructuring charge of $14 million. Operating margin was 1.6% in the quarter.
Our BSS bookings of about $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, where virtually all of these contracts came from new customers.
Let me move on to our cash flow performance in the quarter. On the next slide, you see that our free cash flow was negative $25 million compared with a negative $403 million in the prior year. Free cash flow improved primarily due to better working capital performance. CapEx was down $123 million year-over-year, as a result of tighter discipline around capital spending.
On the next slide, we have highlighted a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3.2 billion, down about $700 million from a year ago. As a result, our DSOs were 72 days, an improvement of 15 days year-over-year. About half the improvement was due to a settlement of claims with the U.S. government, with the remainder stemming from operational improvements across the company, including better collections.
Now our DSO, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 42 days. Our debt maturity schedule is also shown on the slide. We have $300 million of term notes coming due in February and $700 million maturing in March of 2013. We have $1 billion of cash on hand, as I mentioned earlier. $316 million of that cash is in the U.S. $684 million is in -- is offshore.
I want to stress that the substantial amount of the cash held outside the U.S. can be made available to us in the U.S. through the settlement of intercompany loans in a tax-effective manner.
While we also have access to the capital market, as well as access to our $1.5 billion credit facility, which is undrawn, which all of these, it gives us ample financial flexibility to address the upcoming debt maturities.
Next, on the following slide, I will comment briefly on our progress to take $1 billion out of our cost structure over the next 18 months. Now we're focusing on a number of areas, which we've listed on this slide. First, we expect continued improvement from our focused list contracts, develop an economic plan for each of these contracts to improve the performance. Our results in the first quarter clearly shows that we're off to a great start. Our objective is to achieve $100 million to $200 million improvement in profitability in fiscal 2013.
Another area of opportunity is in sourcing and procurement. We are following a two-pronged approach to extract greater savings there. We're consolidating our procurement spending with fewer vendors, and we're negotiating better terms with those vendors. We are also instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors. And we're ensuring that purchases are only made when needed or required contractually.
Third, we have efforts underway to optimize our workforce utilization. We've taken actions already in the quarter in select markets to restructure our workforce. And we're looking at opportunities to better leverage our low-cost, offshore resources.
Now IT rationalization should also lead to cost savings as we standardize our IT tools and systems. And we believe that greater G&A efficiencies are there and should contribute to our savings targets as we implement efforts to consolidate our real estate footprint also across the company.
Now the collective impact of these activities should be $500 million to $600 million reductions to our cost structure in 2013, fiscal 2013. And most of these savings should fall to the bottom line.
Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to clarify CSC's baseline performance for 2012. On the current slide, we've adjusted fiscal 2012 results for special items. On that basis, EPS for fiscal 2012 would have been $0.67 with an operating margin of 3.4% and an EBIT margin of 2%. Now you can refer to the appendix for a reconciliation of those -- for those numbers.
For fiscal 2013, we expect improvement of 200 to 300 basis points to operating and EBIT margins, consistent with what we shared with you previously.
Improvement is driven by our $500 million to $600 million cost takeout program, and will be partially offset by a combination of customer-committed savings and reinvestments in the business.
As a result, we're targeting an EPS of $2.10 to $2.30 for the year. And we're assuming a tax rate of 32% to 36%. We're also targeting free cash flow in the range of $300 million to $350 million.
So in summary, we're off to a good start for the year. We have a number of actions underway to improve our profitability and cash flow. We still have a challenging road ahead, but we're encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing on our transformation journey. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments."

Clearly, we should be at a higher run rate as we exit fiscal '13 than we are right now. And then we'll be able to share with you, on a regular basis, certainly on an annual basis, what we think those cost takedowns are going to amount to. We'll also make some investments. We're going to make some investments in some of our systems, for example, our financial systems, our contract management systems, our project profitability systems. So we're going to make investments. But the bulk of the savings, yes, we intend to deliver to the bottom line as we go through."

I don't accept out of the blocks that we have to be substantially worse than our competitors. Our competitors have figured out how to return more capital to the investor base. They figured out how to get a better return on investment capital and they figured out how to run their operations more efficiently, though they can expand their margins. And I think we, at CSC, aspire to be more like those winning competitors in the market rather than try to continually explain why we are different. We do have a federal business, as you know. There's a top end to what you can do from a profitability standpoint before you attract a lot of attention. But yes, that's all real. But I don't accept that our commercial business has to be so subpar to our competitors. I don't see we have this. Our people are as good. Our skills are as good. Our intellectual property is good. So I don't accept intellectually, as a point of departure, that we have to be substantially worse. But it will take some time to improve those metrics."

I -- we are not seeing a lot of new problem accounts. We're always going to have some problem accounts. You know that as well as I do, but just not 35 or 40 of them at the same time. So we are not seeing a lot of new ones. And I attribute that primarily to the fact that we are managing these much more diligently from the very beginning. So a lot of the transition services that we provide, for example, we're spending a lot more time and focus on understanding what the risk factors are and mitigating those risks before we start the contract. We are making sure that we have qualified project managers and account executives on these big deals before we get started. If we're doing a contract that is somewhat new to us on our new geography, we are supplementing the local team with experts from around the company that have had that experience. So all of that is what I sum up around the whole contracting and delivery discipline process. And as a result of that, we are beginning to tackle some of these issues before they become issues. In terms of the total numbers, 35 or 40, what does that represent in terms of total revenue to the company? It's somewhere in the neighborhood of probably $3 billion, Rod. Think of it and that's roughly the zip code of the revenue there. And we're trying to, as we've talked about before, generate $100 million, $200 million of improved profitability off of those contracts by a various set of means that I have already articulated on this call. Does that get to your question?"

And we've probably added 3 or 4 to that list as we've gotten in and looked at these earlier on, which said, ""Wait a second, we see some risks here. Let's get on this now."" So over time, what I'm hopeful is this list, if you will, begins to morph from troubled contracts, if you will, to contracts that we want to focus on because of their risk level or because of some other unique things that we want to manage upfront rather than wait until they become troubled and go on a troubled contract list. So it becomes more of a proactive approach, Rod, as opposed to a reactive approach. And to be quite candid, we're still more in the reactive mode than the proactive mode."

So in terms of the root cost of why the problem contracts were not sort of known within the company, was that a case of the prior management team being in a phase of denial? Or was it a situation where the company just literally didn't have enough information to know the underlying performance on these deals? And I asked that, Mike, because I understand the operational root cause is the problem deals. But investors are looking for some clarity on whether the informational gaps are fixed such that we're not in for big negative surprises going forward just because of a lack of information or a lack of sort of awareness of what's happening."

I mean, the truth is, from my perspective, CSC had very good processes and procedures in place. And my analysis is, for whatever reason, they stopped following those processes and procedures in a disciplined way. And I think that occurred, Rod, when we began to move from a global delivery approach to a regional delivery approach. We fractured that, and not only did we not follow those same disciplined processes, but the information that was flowing more on this fragmented basis was much more difficult to collate and get together quickly so that you could respond before you had problems. So as I've said, we've made substantial changes in how we manage this stuff. So we have a deal qualification process now. It requires very strict approvals from our industry people, our salespeople, as well as the offerings people. And we are absolutely enforcing that discipline. There's a pre-bid review and approval. So we're not getting into bids that we just are not comfortable that we have the skills or the capability to deliver against where we just don't like the margins. And then, once we are successful on closing business, and we, as you saw this quarter, we closed quite a bit of business, then we immediately move into the contract execution process. So the people that were part of the capture team, the people who were part of the contract negotiation now will stay with that contract as we begin to move into the execution phase. So it's not one thing that caused these problems. It was a number of things that got out of sync that needed to be brought back in, needed to have a full transparency, put sunshine on them and make sure that we manage them with a much greater sense of discipline. Does that answer the question?"

I will say that there are a lot of issues. As I just said with Rod, there was discipline that was lost in the system, and that showed up in deteriorating performance over a period of time. And this did not happen in 1 year or 1 quarter. As Paul and I went back and we looked at CSC over the last 5 or 6 years, I mean there was a deteriorating performance along the way, not only in terms of margins but free cash flow. I mean, our return on capital, there was just a steady deterioration. And then CSC got to a tipping point last year when a couple of really bad things came to life all at the same time, most notably NHS. So we have embarked on this program to get these issues fixed.

And then you get all the emotional arguments. Well, the CEO is going to call you and the world is going to end. And I said, ""Fine, have the CEO call me because I'm not going to bid something that doesn't return my cost of capital."" And if he would do that to his board, I'm going to ask him to come down and have that discussion with my board. So we once backed out, and we bidded the higher lever we want. So part of this is just sticking to your guns and feeling confident that you understand your cost and you understand what your cost of capital is and you articulate that in the bid and why you're bidding what you're bidding, and making sure that you have the right cost recovery plans in place in the contract, in the execution of the delivery so that you can deliver against that economic game plan. So I think there are cases where we're probably not bidding or we're losing because we are not as competitive right now. But over time, as we take this cost out, we improve this margin, this allows us more pricing flexibility. And that will then allow us to compete for more deals in the marketplace. This quarter, we had very good signs, but a lot of that was carryover from some large deals that did not close last year that happened to close this year. So these booking numbers are notoriously lumpy as you go through the year. The most important thing is that we're much more focused on booking business, that we're comfortable we can execute on and we can make an adequate return as opposed to just chasing revenue for revenue sake."

In order to get to a much more competitive position with some of the key leaders in the industry, yes, we will need revenue growth. So you can't save your weight of prosperity. But where we are in the first phase of this turnaround, we can make some significant improvements in our operating performance just by managing ourselves more effectively. But ultimately, you must get revenue growth. I'm a big believer that until you have a foundation in place, that you've got confidence in, that you can execute and you can deliver against, it doesn't do you any good to grow, grow, grow, if you're not on strong foundation because all you do is create bigger and bigger problems.

So think of that as a cabinet office and so on and so forth in the U.K. government. And let me be clear, we do not have any approval at that level. But we have been working very, very hard, making sure we've got definition on what the offering is going to be, definition on what the pricing for that offering will be, definition on all of the outstanding puts and takes so that each side has been claiming and talking about. We've got very good agreement on that. We've got a lot of work that we've done on the forward approval process. So when trusts come into the NHS to get approval on their projects so they can be funded by NHS, that requires approval process. We've made a great deal of progress on that. So I think we are making very good progress on this. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able, at some point in time, to conclude. But we have not included as of today. Currently, we've got about 200 people or so in the U.K. that are an expense to us, that we do not have revenue to offset that expense. And we're running that through the P&L. We are not capitalizing on that. That's in our results this quarter. And yes, there is a certain period of time where you say, ""Geez, if you can't get to a contract, what are you going to do with those people?"" We have use for those people. We have good demand for our iSOFT software in other parts of the world. We have -- I have been reluctant to disband that U.K. team until we get to some conclusion because once you disband them, you don't get them back together. So once some go here or there to support other projects, you don't get them back. But I am quite comfortable that those people can be quickly deployed against revenue-producing opportunities. So either we get to a contract here. We can utilize those people. We begin to actively sell the U.K. market. We begin to generate revenue. We begin to make money or we don't.

So the leverage point is we want to be able to go out and begin to sell our agreed upon solution in those trusts. And the trust will come back and try to get approval for funding from NHS. That's what we want to get into. So we can begin to sell our offering and then begin to deliver that offering and then build that offering and collect the cash of that offering. And that's why -- what we did last quarter, why I mentioned in my comments, where we shipped this care management module to 3 trust and it went live and we have -- got agreement to be paid for that. That's a major step forward in our progress with NHS."

Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for your interest in CSC, and joining us this morning. As Steve said, I am joined here by Paul Saleh. I really have 4 messages that I would like to leave you with this morning. And then I'll develop each of those messages in a little more detail. But first, we are beginning to see some early signs of an improving financial performance. The second key message is that we are putting some very strong turnaround actions in place and are beginning to execute against those actions. The third message is we still have, as I've said many time, a lot of work ahead of us to be done, and we do see some market uncertainties. And the fourth key message I'd like to leave you with this morning is that we are trying to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and to try to clear up as much of the ambiguity around our performance as we possibly can.
So I'm going to delve into a little more detail on those messages, and then I will turn it over to Paul, who will go through a little more detail of the first quarter results. And then as always, we'll open it up for some questions and answers.
So let me just develop the first key message here, that we are beginning to see some early signs of improving financial performance. One, our sales were very good in the first quarter. We had new business awards of $4 billion, which were significantly better than the same period a year ago, up 74%, with very strong signings in our MSS business, $2.2 billion, and that included 20 new logos or 20 new customers.
One of the major contracts we signed was with Alstom, which is a world leader in power generation. And this is -- I'm singling this out because this was a very large cloud and global infrastructure services win for us. And I think it begins to validate our increasing strength in cloud computing.
Revenue was up around 1% in constant currency to about $3.96 billion. As we had anticipated, the commercial growth that we saw in the quarter was offset by a decline in our NPS segment. For the full year, I continue to expect NPS revenue will probably decline by mid-single digits, as we've talked about before. And on the commercial side, we expect sort of flattish revenues, primarily due to some of the market headwinds, but also resulting from our increased focus on profitability and our increased focus on our portfolio of contracts.
We also reported very strong improvements to our cash flow. Free cash flow was a negative $25 million, which is about a $378 million improvement year-on-year. This improvement came primarily through a higher cash flow from operations, improved working capital, but also reflected the fact that we made substantially less bonus payments in the first quarter.
Profitability was solid. We really are beginning to realize some improvements from our focus on contract management discipline, as well as some early initial returns from our cost takeout program. Operating margins of 4.6% showed a strong sequential increase and a slight year-over-year increase.
MSS margins showed a marked improvement, again primarily due to our contract discipline on many of our focus contracts. NPS margins were slightly down, and the BSS margins declined year-on-year.
In many meetings I've had with you, many of you on the phone today, I know there has been some confusion relating to CSC's fiscal year '12 baseline of profitability. And as a result, our plans for improvement off of that baseline. Paul is going to go through that in a little more detail today and then, if necessary, again when we get together on September 10. But I just wanted to reiterate that we are continuing to target a 200 to 300 basis point improvement to our operating margin before corporate G&A. So no change to that target.
And then, finally, from a financial standpoint, our earnings per share were $0.26, which we were pleased to see and largely a result of the aforementioned items.
The second key message I wanted to leave you with today is that we are taking some very strident, strong actions that we're beginning to execute on against our turnaround plan. One is our troubled contracts or our focused contracts. I think, as we've spoken in the past, we identified 35 to 40 contracts that were underperforming and that we were focused on. And since that time, our focus has really resulted in significant improvement across many of these accounts. We've implemented remediation actions for all the accounts. And in some instances, these actions include new leadership, transition controls, stronger program management disciplines. And as I said before, this is monitored on a weekly basis. And there has not been a lot of change to that list, which is good news. So we're still focused on the same ones and don't have a lot of new ones coming on to that list. And additionally, a lot of the new contracts that we have signed, or all the new contracts that we've signed in the first quarter, were beginning to follow the same disciplined program management approach. So we're getting comfortable that the new contracts that we are signing are adhering to the disciplines that we are applying to those contracts that we are focused on as underperforming.
We made good progress with NHS. We're continuing to work with NHS. And during the quarter, CSC achieved a key milestone with Lorenzo care management software. We delivered this new software to 3 trusts in the United Kingdom. And as a result of making that milestone, NHS has agreed to pay us for that milestone. So that's very good news as we continue to move forward with NHS.
The billion dollar cost takeout program that we have talked about in the past, we have initiated this cost takeout plan. We expect to realize this $1 billion over roughly an 18-month period of time. And this plan includes not only the contract performance, which I just mentioned, but also a whole series of other cost and expense actions. And Paul will take you through that in a little more detail.
We've also, as part of our turnaround efforts, simplified our operating model and have brought a lot of new leadership into CSC. So we have now begun the initial implementation phases of a much simpler and clear operating model that will allow us to respond much more quickly to market change and client needs, make decisions faster, as well as reduce costs and inefficiencies that were in the previous operating model.
On, I think, our previous earnings call, I'd indicated that you could expect more management changes. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to attract some fantastic talent to our top leadership team. As you know, Paul Saleh's joined us as CFO; Sunita Holzer is our Chief Human Resource Officer; Gary Budzinski is the Head of our infrastructure business. Earlier this week, we announced that Tom Hogan is the new President of our application services. And we promoted Dave Zolet to be the President of our NPS segment. So significant changes to the top leadership team here, and very, very pleased with the level of talent that we have been able to attract to CSC.
When we get together on September 10, I'm going to share more details about the new operating model, what our intentions are in terms of standardizing many of our services' offerings and our ability to scale those on a more global basis, as well as our transition to cloud computing, our investment efforts around cyber security and the standardized global processes and support functions that will drive greater efficiency, help us take cost out of the business and also improve our go-to-market model. So we will go in much greater detail on some of these turnaround actions when we get together on September 10.
The final message is, as I said, we still -- or not the final message, but we still have a lot of work to do here. We've taken some strong actions on many fronts. I think the first quarter reflects some of those early returns. There's a lot to be done, but I am encouraged by the improvements. And I am most encouraged by the enthusiasm and the passion and the energy that the CSC employees are putting behind this collective effort to get our business on a different trajectory. So we're executing with urgency. We do continue to see some headwinds out there, most notably Europe. And in the federal government, in Europe, we are beginning to see some impact, particularly to our consulting business. As you know, we've taken steps to restructure our business operations in the U.K., in the Nordics and in Germany to reflect some of the headwinds that we anticipate as we go through this fiscal year.
On the federal side of our business, we clearly are seeing delays in award decisions, as are many of our competitors and other participants in this industry. And we expect that this continuing resolution and the potential impact of sequestration will continue to create an environment of uncertainty for many of our federal customers, and that will cause some delays in contract signing.
So those are the 2 primary headwinds we see as we go through this fiscal year.
The final message before I turn this over to Paul is that we want to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and about our accounting and about our business.
With respect to the audit committee's independent investigation into our accounting errors, the committee has determined that independent investigation is complete. Since the filing of our fiscal 2012 10-K, the independent investigation did not identify any new accounting errors, although our 10-Q will identify certain items that management believes could result in immaterial changes in the amount and allocation of period adjustments for fiscal 2013 in prior years. So the independent investigation has been completed. We'll continue, of course, to work with the SEC investigation and are cooperating fully as that goes forward.
Paul will, when I turn this over to him in a couple seconds here, will articulate our baseline performance for fiscal '12 results. There was some confusion over that. And I think this will provide a much clearer starting point so that you can measure and track our financial performance as we go through this year.
I think the baseline will be important as we describe the financial targets for each of the stages of our turnaround program when we get together at our Investor Day in New York in September.
But again, our goal here is to be clear and as transparent as possible so that you have a full understanding of our plan and can track our progress and challenges as we go forward. So with that, Paul, I will turn it over to you."

And I'm pleased to be part of CSC during a time of significant transition. We have great assets to build on. We have a strong and loyal customer base and unique intellectual property across many of our businesses. As Mike mentioned, in the coming months, we'll be sharing with you more details about our plans to reduce the company's cost structure, improve our performance and strengthen our financial position. But today, my comments will focus on the first quarter results, and I'll also discuss our liquidity and our cash flow position. And I will comment on our $1 billion cost takeout program and provide greater clarity around our fiscal 2012 baseline EPS and margins and provide some fiscal 2013 outlook.
So on the next slide, let me begin with our first quarter results. They're summarized on Slide 10. We reported revenues of approximately $4 billion, which is up 1% on a constant currency basis. Our operating margins in the quarter were 4.6%, relatively in line with the prior year but up strongly sequentially. EPS was $0.26 per share compared with $0.41 last year. Last year was adjusted to exclude a one-time tax benefit.
Now, our tax rate in the quarter was close to 43% due to our mix of earnings and the impact of foreign earnings coming from jurisdictions where we have a valuation allowance. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%.
Our free cash flow was negative $25 million in the quarter, but that is $378 million better than last year. And I'll have more to say on that later.
On the next slide, let me turn to our segment results, starting with our public sector business. Our total NPS revenues were $1.37 billion for the quarter and represent 34% of our total company revenues.
Revenues from Department of Defense contracts accounted for 67% of NPS revenues in the quarter and were down 9% year-over-year, primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year.
Revenue from civil agencies accounted for 29% of NPS revenues. Civil revenues declined 4%, primarily due to reduced scope on existing contracts and the timing of certain contractual milestones. But for the full year, we still expect NPS to be down mid-single digits, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets.
NPS operating income was $101 million in the quarter and operating margins was 7.4%.
Net NPS bookings of $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, and about 43% of those bookings came through our IDIQ contract vehicles.
Turning now to our Managed Services segment, which is on the next slide. Revenues were $1.64 billion and accounted for 41% of the company's total revenues. Revenues in MSS were up 1% year-over-year, but up nearly 5% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the acquisition of AppLabs, which helped offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income of $95 million increased by $86 million compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by significant improvement in the performance of our focused list of contracts, which partially offset a workforce restructuring charge of $13 million in the quarter.
Operating margin rebounded to 5.8%. MSS bookings of $2.2 billion were substantially better than a year ago due to new contracts such as Alstom, and Mike mentioned that, as well as contract awards from leading financial service providers in the U.S. and an important contract award in Europe.
Turning to our Business Solutions & Services segment. Our BSS revenues were $985 million in the quarter, or 25% of the total company's revenues. BSS revenues increased 2.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant currency, as a result of the iSOFT acquisition and revenue growth from NHS. iSOFT contributed $54 million during the quarter. And CSC successfully deployed, as Mike mentioned, the Lorenzo care management software at 3 NHS trusts.
BSS operating income was $16 million. That was a decline of $41 million year-over-year. That was due to a iSOFT dilution of $28 million and a workforce restructuring charge of $14 million. Operating margin was 1.6% in the quarter.
Our BSS bookings of about $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, where virtually all of these contracts came from new customers.
Let me move on to our cash flow performance in the quarter. On the next slide, you see that our free cash flow was negative $25 million compared with a negative $403 million in the prior year. Free cash flow improved primarily due to better working capital performance. CapEx was down $123 million year-over-year, as a result of tighter discipline around capital spending.
On the next slide, we have highlighted a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3.2 billion, down about $700 million from a year ago. As a result, our DSOs were 72 days, an improvement of 15 days year-over-year. About half the improvement was due to a settlement of claims with the U.S. government, with the remainder stemming from operational improvements across the company, including better collections.
Now our DSO, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 42 days. Our debt maturity schedule is also shown on the slide. We have $300 million of term notes coming due in February and $700 million maturing in March of 2013. We have $1 billion of cash on hand, as I mentioned earlier. $316 million of that cash is in the U.S. $684 million is in -- is offshore.
I want to stress that a substantial amount of the cash held outside the U.S. can be made available to us in the U.S. through the settlement of intercompany loans in a tax-effective manner.
Now, we also have access to the capital market, as well as access to our $1.5 billion credit facility, which is undrawn, which all of these, then, gives us ample financial flexibility to address the upcoming debt maturities.
Next, on the following slide, I will comment briefly on our progress to take $1 billion out of our cost structure over the next 18 months. Now, we're focusing on a number of areas, which we've listed on the slide. First, we expect continued improvement from our focused list contracts. We'll develop an economic plan for each of these contracts to improve the performance. Our results in the first quarter clearly shows that we're off to a great start. Our objective is to achieve $100 million to $200 million improvement in profitability in fiscal 2013.
Another area of opportunity is in sourcing and procurement. We are following a two-pronged approach to extract greater savings there. We're consolidating our procurement spending with fewer vendors, and we're negotiating better terms with those vendors. We are also instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors. And we're ensuring that purchases are only made when needed or required contractually.
Third, we have efforts underway to optimize our workforce utilization. We've taken actions already in the quarter in select markets to restructure our workforce. And we're looking at opportunities to better leverage our low-cost, offshore resources.
Now, IT rationalization should also lead to cost savings as we standardize our IT tools and systems. And we believe that greater G&A efficiencies are there and should contribute to our savings targets as we implement efforts to consolidate our real estate footprint also across the company.
Now the collective impact of these activities should be $500 million to $600 million reductions to our cost structure in 2013 -- fiscal 2013. And most of these savings should fall to the bottom line.
Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to clarify CSC's baseline performance for 2012. So on the current slide, we've adjusted fiscal 2012 results for special items. On that basis, EPS for fiscal 2012 would have been $0.67 with an operating margin of 3.4% and an EBIT margin of 2%. Now, you can refer to the appendix for a reconciliation of those -- for those numbers.
For fiscal 2013, we expect an improvement of 200 to 300 basis points to operating and EBIT margins, consistent with what we shared with you previously.
The improvement is driven by our $500 million to $600 million cost takeout program, and will be partially offset by a combination of customer-committed savings and reinvestments in the business.
As a result, we're targeting an EPS of $2.10 to $2.30 for the year. And we're assuming a tax rate of 32% to 36%. We're also targeting free cash flow in the range of $300 million to $350 million.
So in summary, we're off to a good start for the year. We have a number of actions underway to improve our profitability and cash flow. We still have a challenging road ahead, but we're encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing on our transformation journey. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments."

We are making sure that we have qualified project managers and account executives on these big deals before we get started. If we're doing a contract that is somewhat new to us in our new geography, we are supplementing the local team with experts from around the company that have had that experience. So all of that is what I sum up around the whole contracting and delivery discipline process. And as a result of that, we are beginning to tackle some of these issues before they become issues.

And I ask that, Mike, because I understand the operational root cause is the problem deals.

I mean, the truth is, from my perspective, CSC had very good processes and procedures in place. And my analysis is, for whatever reason, they stopped following those processes and procedures in a disciplined way. And I think that occurred, Rod, when we began to move from a global delivery approach to a regional delivery approach. We fractured that, and not only did we not follow those same disciplined processes, but the information that was flowing more on this fragmented basis was much more difficult to collate and get together quickly so that you could respond before you had problems. So as I've said, we've made substantial changes in how we manage this stuff. So we have a deal qualification process now. It requires very strict approvals from our industry people, our salespeople, as well as the offerings people. And we are absolutely enforcing that discipline. There's a pre-bid review and approval. So we're not getting into bids that we just are not comfortable that we have the skills or the capability to deliver against, or we just don't like the margins. And then, once we are successful on closing business, and we, as you saw this quarter, we closed quite a bit of business, then we immediately move into the contract execution process. So the people that were part of the capture team, the people who were part of the contract negotiation now will stay with that contract as we begin to move into the execution phase. So it's not one thing that caused these problems. It was a number of things that got out of sync that needed to be brought back in, needed to have a full transparency, put sunshine on them and make sure that we manage them with a much greater sense of discipline. That answer your question?"

First of all, I have said from the very beginning that most of the problems that I saw at CSC, I have seen before in my career and were fixable. And I still absolutely believe in that. I will say that there are a lot of issues. As I just said with Rod, there was discipline that was lost in the system, and that showed up in deteriorating performance over a period of time. And this did not happen in 1 year or 1 quarter. As Paul and I went back and we looked at CSC over the last 5 or 6 years, I mean, there was a deteriorating performance along the way, not only in terms of margins but free cash flow. I mean, our return on capital, there was just a steady deterioration. And then CSC got to a tipping point last year when a couple of really bad things came to life all at the same time, most notably NHS. So we have embarked on this program to get these issues fixed. I am encouraged, but I would caution that there is a lot of work to do here. We have just gotten comfortable that we've identified most of the problems. I am -- and I'm very confident and optimistic that we've got our arms around what those problems and those issues are. I need more time, and that will be measured in quarters, not in weeks or months, before I get confident that we have got the right execution plans in place that we can deliver consistent performance over time. That is work, candidly, that is still ahead of us. But I feel very good about the people we have in this company, the skills we have, the passion, the willingness to adjust the business model so that we can provide better service to the client and better returns to our investors. Does that answer the question?"

In some cases, it doesn't. I mean, I'll give you an example here where we had a bid that came in. I'm not going to name the client, but they wanted to bid this at x%. We said, ""Well, there's no way we're going to bid at",354,"Well, it does impact in some cases. In some cases, it doesn't. I mean, I'll give you an example here where we had a bid that came in. I'm not going to name the client, but they wanted to bid this at x%. We said, ""Well, there's no way we're going to bid at that operating margin. Forget it."" And then you get all the emotional arguments. Well, the CEO is going to call you and the world is going to end. And I said, ""Fine, have the CEO call me because I'm not going to bid something that doesn't return my cost of capital."" And if he would do that to his board, I'm going to ask him to come down and have that discussion with my board. So we went back out, and we bid at the higher level we want. So part of this is just sticking to your guns and feeling confident that you understand your cost and you understand what your cost of capital is and you articulate that in the bid and why you're bidding what you're bidding, and making sure that you have the right cost recovery plans in place in the contract, in the execution of the delivery, so that you can deliver against that economic game plan. So I think there are cases where we're probably not bidding or where we're losing because we are not as competitive right now. But over time, as we take these costs out and we improve this margin, this allows us more pricing flexibility. And that will then allow us to compete for more deals in the marketplace. This quarter, we had a very good signs, but a lot of that was carryovers from some large deals that did not close last year that happened to close this year. So these booking numbers are notoriously lumpy as you go through the year. But the most important thing is that we're much more focused on booking business that we're comfortable we can execute on and we can make an adequate return, as opposed to just chasing revenue for revenue's sake."

So with these cost actions, with the disciplines we're trying to put in place around the contracts, we could get to a 200 or 300 basis point improvement basically just by managing our book of business that we have today more efficiently, more effectively. Ultimately, go back to an earlier question that was asked, ""Gee, what do you think the steady state returns are in this company?"" Well, in order to get to a much more competitive position with some of the key leaders in the industry, yes, we will need revenue growth. So you can't save your weight of prosperity. But where we are in the first phase of this turnaround, we can make some significant improvements in our operating performance just by managing ourselves more effectively. But ultimately, you must get revenue growth. I'm a big believer that until you have a foundation in place that you've got confidence in, that you can execute and you can deliver against, it doesn't do you any good to grow, grow, grow, if you're not on a strong foundation. Because all you do is create bigger and bigger problems.

I don't have as much confidence that we'll be able to get all that done because that revolves around negotiating with vendors. It requires putting new processes in place where you consolidate buying, et cetera, et cetera. So we've identified it. I have a little less confidence in that.

So think of that as the cabinet office and so on and so forth in the U.K. government. And let me be clear, we do not have any approval at that level. But we have been working very, very hard, making sure we've got definition on what the offering is going to be, definition on what the pricing for that offering will be, definition on all of the outstanding puts and takes so that each side has been claiming and talking about. We've got very good agreement on that. We've got a lot of work that we've done on the forward approval process. So when trusts come into the NHS to get approval on their projects so they can be funded by NHS, that requires approval process. We've made a great deal of progress on that. So I think we are making very good progress on this. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able, at some point in time, to conclude. But we have not concluded as of today. Currently, we've got about 200 people or so in the U.K. that are an expense to us, that we do not have revenue to offset that expense. And we're running that through the P&L. We are not capitalizing on that. That's in our results this quarter. And yes, there is a certain period of time where you say, ""Gee, if you can't get to a contract, what are you going to do with those people?"" We have use for those people. We have good demand for our iSOFT software in other parts of the world. We have -- I have been reluctant to disband that U.K. team until we get to some conclusion because once you disband them, you don't get them back together. So once some go here or there to support other projects, you don't get them back. But I am quite comfortable that those people can be quickly deployed against revenue-producing opportunities. So either we get to a contract here. We can utilize those people. We begin to actively sell in the U.K. market. We begin to generate revenue. We begin to make money or we don't. And as you know, we took most of those charges last year. So I don't anticipate that we have any large cash charges associated with disbanding those people if that would be the point that we got to."

Finally, I'd like to remind our listeners that CSC assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call, except, of course, as required by law.
Moving to the next slide, I'd like to introduce Mike Lawrie."

Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for your interest in CSC, and joining us this morning. As Steve said, I am joined here by Paul Saleh. I really have 4 messages that I would like to leave you with this morning. And then I'll develop each of those messages in a little more detail. But first, we are beginning to see some early signs of an improving financial performance. The second key message is that we are putting some very strong turnaround actions in place and are beginning to execute against those actions. The third message is we still have, as I've said many time, a lot of work ahead of us to be done, and we do see some market uncertainties. And the fourth key message I'd like to leave you with this morning is that we are trying to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and to try to clear up as much of the ambiguity around our performance as we possibly can.
So I'm going to delve into a little more detail on those messages, and then I will turn it over to Paul, who will go through a little more detail of the first quarter results. And then as always, we'll open it up for some questions and answers.
So let me just develop the first key message here, that we are beginning to see some early signs of improving financial performance. One, our sales were very good in the first quarter. We had new business awards of $4 billion, which were significantly better than the same period a year ago, up 74%, with very strong signings in our MSS business, $2.2 billion, and that included 20 new logos or 20 new customers.
One of the major contracts we signed was with Alstom, which is a world leader in power generation. And this is -- I'm singling this out because this was a very large cloud and global infrastructure services win for us. And I think it begins to validate our increasing strength in cloud computing.
Revenue was up around 1% in constant currency to about $3.96 billion. As we had anticipated, the commercial growth that we saw in the quarter was offset by a decline in our NPS segment. For the full year, I continue to expect NPS revenue will probably decline by mid-single digits, as we've talked about before. And on the commercial side, we expect sort of flattish revenues, primarily due to some of the market headwinds, but also resulting from our increased focus on profitability and our increased focus on our portfolio of contracts.
We also reported very strong improvements to our cash flow. Free cash flow was a negative $25 million, which is about a $378 million improvement year-on-year. This improvement came primarily through a higher cash flow from operations, improved working capital, but also reflected the fact that we made substantially less bonus payments in the first quarter.
Profitability was solid. We really are beginning to realize some improvements from our focus on contract management discipline, as well as some early initial returns from our cost takeout program. Operating margins of 4.6% showed a strong sequential increase and a slight year-over-year increase.
MSS margins showed a marked improvement, again primarily due to our contract discipline on many of our focus contracts. NPS margins were slightly down, and the BSS margins declined year-on-year.
In many meetings I've had with you, many of you on the phone today, I know there has been some confusion relating to CSC's fiscal year '12 baseline of profitability. And as a result, our plans for improvement off of that baseline. Paul is going to go through that in a little more detail today and then, if necessary, again when we get together on September 10. But I just wanted to reiterate that we are continuing to target a 200 to 300 basis point improvement to our operating margin before corporate G&A. So no change to that target.
And then, finally, from a financial standpoint, our earnings per share were $0.26, which we were pleased to see and largely a result of the aforementioned items.
The second key message I wanted to leave you with today is that we are taking some very strident, strong actions that we're beginning to execute on against our turnaround plan. One is our troubled contracts or our focused contracts. I think, as we've spoken in the past, we identified 35 to 40 contracts that were underperforming and that we were focused on. And since that time, our focus has really resulted in significant improvement across many of these accounts. We've implemented remediation actions for all the accounts. And in some instances, these actions include new leadership, transition controls, stronger program management disciplines. And as I said before, this is monitored on a weekly basis. And there has not been a lot of change to that list, which is good news. So we're still focused on the same ones and don't have a lot of new ones coming on to that list. And additionally, a lot of the new contracts that we have signed, or all the new contracts that we've signed in the first quarter, were beginning to follow the same disciplined program management approach. So we're getting comfortable that the new contracts that we are signing are adhering to the disciplines that we are applying to those contracts that we are focused on as underperforming.
We made good progress with NHS. We're continuing to work with NHS. And during the quarter, CSC achieved a key milestone with Lorenzo care management software. We delivered this new software to 3 trusts in the United Kingdom. And as a result of making that milestone, NHS has agreed to pay us for that milestone. So that's very good news as we continue to move forward with NHS.
The billion dollar cost takeout program that we have talked about in the past, we have initiated this cost takeout plan. We expect to realize this $1 billion over roughly an 18-month period of time. And this plan includes not only the contract performance, which I just mentioned, but also a whole series of other cost and expense actions. And Paul will take you through that in a little more detail.
We've also, as part of our turnaround efforts, simplified our operating model and have brought a lot of new leadership into CSC. So we have now begun the initial implementation phases of a much simpler and clear operating model that will allow us to respond much more quickly to market change and client needs, make decisions faster, as well as reduce costs and inefficiencies that were in the previous operating model.
On, I think, our previous earnings call, I'd indicated that you could expect more management changes. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to attract some fantastic talent to our top leadership team. As you know, Paul Saleh's joined us as CFO; Sunita Holzer is our Chief Human Resource Officer; Gary Budzinski is the Head of our infrastructure business. Earlier this week, we announced that Tom Hogan is the new President of our application services. And we promoted Dave Zolet to be the President of our NPS segment. So significant changes to the top leadership team here, and very, very pleased with the level of talent that we have been able to attract to CSC.
When we get together on September 10, I'm going to share more details about the new operating model, what our intentions are in terms of standardizing many of our services' offerings and our ability to scale those on a more global basis, as well as our transition to cloud computing, our investment efforts around cyber security and the standardized global processes and support functions that will drive greater efficiency, help us take cost out of the business and also improve our go-to-market model. So we will go in much greater detail on some of these turnaround actions when we get together on September 10.
The final message is, as I said, we still -- or not the final message, but we still have a lot of work to do here. We've taken some strong actions on many fronts. I think the first quarter reflects some of those early returns. There's a lot to be done, but I am encouraged by the improvements. And I am most encouraged by the enthusiasm and the passion and the energy that the CSC employees are putting behind this collective effort to get our business on a different trajectory. So we're executing with urgency. We do continue to see some headwinds out there, most notably Europe. And in the federal government, in Europe, we are beginning to see some impact, particularly to our consulting business. As you know, we've taken steps to restructure our business operations in the U.K., in the Nordics and in Germany to reflect some of the headwinds that we anticipate as we go through this fiscal year.
On the federal side of our business, we clearly are seeing delays in award decisions, as are many of our competitors and other participants in this industry. And we expect that this continuing resolution and the potential impact of sequestration will continue to create an environment of uncertainty for many of our federal customers, and that will cause some delays in contract signing.
So those are the 2 primary headwinds we see as we go through this fiscal year.
The final message before I turn this over to Paul is that we want to be very clear and very transparent about our performance and about our accounting and about our business.
With respect to the audit committee's independent investigation into our accounting errors, the committee has determined that independent investigation is complete. Since the filing of our fiscal 2012 10-K, the independent investigation did not identify any new accounting errors, although our 10-Q will identify certain items that management believes could result in immaterial changes in the amount and allocation of period adjustments for fiscal 2013 in prior years. So the independent investigation has been completed. We'll continue, of course, to work with the SEC investigation and are cooperating fully as that goes forward.
Paul will, when I turn this over to him in a couple seconds here, will articulate our baseline performance for fiscal '12 results. There was some confusion over that. And I think this will provide a much clearer starting point so that you can measure and track our financial performance as we go through this year.
I think the baseline will be important as we describe the financial targets for each of the stages of our turnaround program when we get together at our Investor Day in New York in September.
But again, our goal here is to be clear and as transparent as possible so that you have a full understanding of our plan and can track our progress and challenges as we go forward. So with that, Paul, I will turn it over to you."

And I'm pleased to be part of CSC during a time of significant transition. We have great assets to build on.

And I'm pleased to be part of CSC during a time of significant transition. We have great assets to build on. We have a strong and loyal customer base and unique intellectual property across many of our businesses. As Mike mentioned, in the coming months, we'll be sharing with you more details about our plans to reduce the company's cost structure, improve our performance and strengthen our financial position. But today, my comments will focus on the first quarter results, and I'll also discuss our liquidity and our cash flow position. And I will comment on our $1 billion cost takeout program and provide greater clarity around our fiscal 2012 baseline EPS and margins and provide some fiscal 2013 outlook.
So on the next slide, let me begin with our first quarter results. They're summarized on Slide 10. We reported revenues of approximately $4 billion, which is up 1% on a constant currency basis. Our operating margins in the quarter were 4.6%, relatively in line with the prior year but up strongly sequentially. EPS was $0.26 per share compared with $0.41 last year. Last year was adjusted to exclude a one-time tax benefit.
Now, our tax rate in the quarter was close to 43% due to our mix of earnings and the impact of foreign earnings coming from jurisdictions where we have a valuation allowance. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%.
Our free cash flow was negative $25 million in the quarter, but that is $378 million better than last year. And I'll have more to say on that later.
On the next slide, let me turn to our segment results, starting with our public sector business. Our total NPS revenues were $1.37 billion for the quarter and represent 34% of our total company revenues.
Revenues from Department of Defense contracts accounted for 67% of NPS revenues in the quarter and were down 9% year-over-year, primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year.
Revenue from civil agencies accounted for 29% of NPS revenues. Civil revenues declined 4%, primarily due to reduced scope on existing contracts and the timing of certain contractual milestones. But for the full year, we still expect NPS to be down mid-single digits, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets.
NPS operating income was $101 million in the quarter and operating margins was 7.4%.
Net NPS bookings of $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, and about 43% of those bookings came through our IDIQ contract vehicles.
Turning now to our Managed Services segment, which is on the next slide. Revenues were $1.64 billion and accounted for 41% of the company's total revenues. Revenues in MSS were up 1% year-over-year, but up nearly 5% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the acquisition of AppLabs, which helped offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income of $95 million increased by $86 million compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by significant improvement in the performance of our focused list of contracts, which partially offset a workforce restructuring charge of $13 million in the quarter.
Operating margin rebounded to 5.8%. MSS bookings of $2.2 billion were substantially better than a year ago due to new contracts such as Alstom, and Mike mentioned that, as well as contract awards from leading financial service providers in the U.S. and an important contract award in Europe.
Turning to our Business Solutions & Services segment. Our BSS revenues were $985 million in the quarter, or 25% of the total company's revenues. BSS revenues increased 2.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant currency, as a result of the iSOFT acquisition and revenue growth from NHS. iSOFT contributed $54 million during the quarter. And CSC successfully deployed, as Mike mentioned, the Lorenzo care management software at 3 NHS trusts.
BSS operating income was $16 million. That was a decline of $41 million year-over-year. That was due to a iSOFT dilution of $28 million and a workforce restructuring charge of $14 million. Operating margin was 1.6% in the quarter.
Our BSS bookings of about $900 million were in line with the year-ago period, where virtually all of these contracts came from new customers.
Let me move on to our cash flow performance in the quarter. On the next slide, you see that our free cash flow was negative $25 million compared with a negative $403 million in the prior year. Free cash flow improved primarily due to better working capital performance. CapEx was down $123 million year-over-year, as a result of tighter discipline around capital spending.
On the next slide, we have highlighted a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3.2 billion, down about $700 million from a year ago. As a result, our DSOs were 72 days, an improvement of 15 days year-over-year. About half the improvement was due to a settlement of claims with the U.S. government, with the remainder stemming from operational improvements across the company, including better collections.
Now our DSO, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 42 days. Our debt maturity schedule is also shown on the slide. We have $300 million of term notes coming due in February and $700 million maturing in March of 2013. We have $1 billion of cash on hand, as I mentioned earlier. $316 million of that cash is in the U.S. $684 million is in -- is offshore.
I want to stress that a substantial amount of the cash held outside the U.S. can be made available to us in the U.S. through the settlement of intercompany loans in a tax-effective manner.
Now, we also have access to the capital market, as well as access to our $1.5 billion credit facility, which is undrawn, which all of these, then, gives us ample financial flexibility to address the upcoming debt maturities.
Next, on the following slide, I will comment briefly on our progress to take $1 billion out of our cost structure over the next 18 months. Now, we're focusing on a number of areas, which we've listed on the slide. First, we expect continued improvement from our focused list contracts. We'll develop an economic plan for each of these contracts to improve the performance. Our results in the first quarter clearly shows that we're off to a great start. Our objective is to achieve $100 million to $200 million improvement in profitability in fiscal 2013.
Another area of opportunity is in sourcing and procurement. We are following a two-pronged approach to extract greater savings there. We're consolidating our procurement spending with fewer vendors, and we're negotiating better terms with those vendors. We are also instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors. And we're ensuring that purchases are only made when needed or required contractually.
Third, we have efforts underway to optimize our workforce utilization. We've taken actions already in the quarter in select markets to restructure our workforce. And we're looking at opportunities to better leverage our low-cost, offshore resources.
Now, IT rationalization should also lead to cost savings as we standardize our IT tools and systems. And we believe that greater G&A efficiencies are there and should contribute to our savings targets as we implement efforts to consolidate our real estate footprint also across the company.
Now the collective impact of these activities should be $500 million to $600 million reductions to our cost structure in 2013 -- fiscal 2013. And most of these savings should fall to the bottom line.
Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to clarify CSC's baseline performance for 2012. So on the current slide, we've adjusted fiscal 2012 results for special items. On that basis, EPS for fiscal 2012 would have been $0.67 with an operating margin of 3.4% and an EBIT margin of 2%. Now, you can refer to the appendix for a reconciliation of those -- for those numbers.
For fiscal 2013, we expect an improvement of 200 to 300 basis points to operating and EBIT margins, consistent with what we shared with you previously.
The improvement is driven by our $500 million to $600 million cost takeout program, and will be partially offset by a combination of customer-committed savings and reinvestments in the business.
As a result, we're targeting an EPS of $2.10 to $2.30 for the year. And we're assuming a tax rate of 32% to 36%. We're also targeting free cash flow in the range of $300 million to $350 million.
So in summary, we're off to a good start for the year. We have a number of actions underway to improve our profitability and cash flow. We still have a challenging road ahead, but we're encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing on our transformation journey. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments."

They figured out how to get a better return on investment capital and they figured out how to run their operations more efficiently, though they can expand their margins. And I think we, at CSC, aspire to be more like those winning competitors in the market rather than try to continually explain why we are different. We do have a federal business, as you know. There's a top end to what you can do from a profitability standpoint before you attract a lot of attention. But yes, that's all real.

So we are not seeing a lot of new ones. And I attribute that primarily to the fact that we are managing these much more diligently from the very beginning. So a lot of the transition services that we provide, for example, we're spending a lot more time and focus on understanding what the risk factors are and mitigating those risks before we start the contract. We are making sure that we have qualified project managers and account executives on these big deals before we get started. If we're doing a contract that is somewhat new to us in our new geography, we are supplementing the local team with experts from around the company that have had that experience. So all of that is what I sum up around the whole contracting and delivery discipline process. And as a result of that, we are beginning to tackle some of these issues before they become issues. In terms of the total numbers, 35 or 40, what does that represent in terms of total revenue to the company? It's somewhere in the neighborhood of probably $3 billion, Rod. Think of it and that's roughly the zip code of the revenue there.

And we've probably added 3 or 4 to that list as we've gotten in and looked at these earlier on, we've said, ""Wait a second, we see some risks here. Let's get on this now."" So over time, what I'm hopeful is this list, if you will, begins to morph from troubled contracts, if you will, to contracts that we want to focus on because of their risk level or because of some other unique things that we want to manage upfront rather than wait until they become troubled and go on a troubled contract list. So it becomes more of a proactive approach, Rod, as opposed to a reactive approach. And to be quite candid, we're still more in the reactive mode than the proactive mode."

Or was it a situation where the company just literally didn't have enough information to know the underlying performance on these deals? And I ask that, Mike, because I understand the operational root cause is the problem deals.

I mean, the truth is, from my perspective, CSC had very good processes and procedures in place. And my analysis is, for whatever reason, they stopped following those processes and procedures in a disciplined way. And I think that occurred, Rod, when we began to move from a global delivery approach to a regional delivery approach. We fractured that, and not only did we not follow those same disciplined processes, but the information that was flowing more on this fragmented basis was much more difficult to collate and get together quickly so that you could respond before you had problems. So as I've said, we've made substantial changes in how we manage this stuff. So we have a deal qualification process now. It requires very strict approvals from our industry people, our salespeople, as well as the offerings people. And we are absolutely enforcing that discipline. There's a pre-bid review and approval. So we're not getting into bids that we just are not comfortable that we have the skills or the capability to deliver against, or we just don't like the margins. And then, once we are successful on closing business, and we, as you saw this quarter, we closed quite a bit of business, then we immediately move into the contract execution process. So the people that were part of the capture team, the people who were part of the contract negotiation now will stay with that contract as we begin to move into the execution phase. So it's not one thing that caused these problems. It was a number of things that got out of sync that needed to be brought back in, needed to have a full transparency, put sunshine on them and make sure that we manage them with a much greater sense of discipline.

I will say that there are a lot of issues. As I just said with Rod, there was discipline that was lost in the system, and that showed up in deteriorating performance over a period of time. And this did not happen in 1 year or 1 quarter. As Paul and I went back and we looked at CSC over the last 5 or 6 years, I mean, there was a deteriorating performance along the way, not only in terms of margins but free cash flow. I mean, our return on capital, there was just a steady deterioration. And then CSC got to a tipping point last year when a couple of really bad things came to life all at the same time, most notably NHS. So we have embarked on this program to get these issues fixed. I am encouraged, but I would caution that there is a lot of work to do here. We have just gotten comfortable that we've identified most of the problems.

And then you get all the emotional arguments. Well, the CEO is going to call you and the world is going to end. And I said, ""Fine, have the CEO call me because I'm not going to bid something that doesn't return my cost of capital."" And if he would do that to his board, I'm going to ask him to come down and have that discussion with my board. So we went back out, and we bid at the higher level we want. So part of this is just sticking to your guns and feeling confident that you understand your cost and you understand what your cost of capital is and you articulate that in the bid and why you're bidding what you're bidding, and making sure that you have the right cost recovery plans in place in the contract, in the execution of the delivery, so that you can deliver against that economic game plan. So I think there are cases where we're probably not bidding or where we're losing because we are not as competitive right now. But over time, as we take these costs out and we improve this margin, this allows us more pricing flexibility. And that will then allow us to compete for more deals in the marketplace. This quarter, we had a very good signs, but a lot of that was carryovers from some large deals that did not close last year that happened to close this year. So these booking numbers are notoriously lumpy as you go through the year. But the most important thing is that we're much more focused on booking business that we're comfortable we can execute on and we can make an adequate return, as opposed to just chasing revenue for revenue's sake."

Well, in order to get to a much more competitive position with some of the key leaders in the industry, yes, we will need revenue growth. So you can't save your weight of prosperity. But where we are in the first phase of this turnaround, we can make some significant improvements in our operating performance just by managing ourselves more effectively. But ultimately, you must get revenue growth. I'm a big believer that until you have a foundation in place that you've got confidence in, that you can execute and you can deliver against, it doesn't do you any good to grow, grow, grow, if you're not on a strong foundation. Because all you do is create bigger and bigger problems. And to some extent, that is what has happened to CSC, is chasing TCV and chasing revenue without the firm foundation in place to deliver against that."

We have very good visibility on that. And I have a high, high degree of confidence that, that will be executed. We've got pretty good line of sight against what we want to do from procurement. I don't have as much confidence that we'll be able to get all that done because that revolves around negotiating with vendors. It requires putting new processes in place where you consolidate buying, et cetera, et cetera. So we've identified it. I have a little less confidence in that. In terms of the goals that we've set for profit improvement on our contracts, I've got great visibility into what contracts there are and what we're trying to do. And over time, I will develop some confidence that we'll be able to execute against that. So I think it's a balanced view. I feel pretty good about that we've identified what we need to identify.

And we are, I think, pretty close to getting towards a tenant agreement with NHS. Now once that gets done, we still have to have the government approval. So think of that as the cabinet office and so on and so forth in the U.K. government. And let me be clear, we do not have any approval at that level. But we have been working very, very hard, making sure we've got definition on what the offering is going to be, definition on what the pricing for that offering will be, definition on all of the outstanding puts and takes so that each side has been claiming and talking about. We've got very good agreement on that. We've got a lot of work that we've done on the forward approval process. So when trusts come into the NHS to get approval on their projects so they can be funded by NHS, that requires approval process. We've made a great deal of progress on that. So I think we are making very good progress on this. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able, at some point in time, to conclude. But we have not concluded as of today. Currently, we've got about 200 people or so in the U.K. that are an expense to us, that we do not have revenue to offset that expense. And we're running that through the P&L. We are not capitalizing on that. That's in our results this quarter. And yes, there is a certain period of time where you say, ""Gee, if you can't get to a contract, what are you going to do with those people?"" We have use for those people. We have good demand for our iSOFT software in other parts of the world. We have -- I have been reluctant to disband that U.K. team until we get to some conclusion because once you disband them, you don't get them back together. So once some go here or there to support other projects, you don't get them back. But I am quite comfortable that those people can be quickly deployed against revenue-producing opportunities. So either we get to a contract here. We can utilize those people. We begin to actively sell in the U.K. market. We begin to generate revenue. We begin to make money or we don't. And as you know, we took most of those charges last year. So I don't anticipate that we have any large cash charges associated with disbanding those people if that would be the point that we got to."

So it's just a calculation issue that makes a quarter like this one artificially high.

Hello to everyone on the call. Thanks for your interest in CSC. As you know, we issued our second quarter results earlier this morning, and I'm joined by Paul Saleh, and he and I will take you through those results",2280,"Okay, thank you Steve, and good morning. Hello to everyone on the call. Thanks for your interest in CSC. As you know, we issued our second quarter results earlier this morning, and I'm joined by Paul Saleh, and he and I will take you through those results and also provide a quick update on some of the other key initiatives that we're executing against to continue to drive improvement in CSC's financial performance. 
I really want to leave you with 4 key messages today, and then I'll develop each of those messages a little bit. But the first message is our solid Q2 results reflect continuing financial improvement, primarily driven by our cost takeout efforts and better contract management. The second message is, we had strong commercial bookings in the quarter, but a lot of the uncertainty in the federal market was a drag on our total bookings and that certainly impacted our NPS bookings. The third message is our turnaround activities that we talked about in September when we were together are gathering pace and we are beginning to see tangible results of this throughout the business. And as a result of that, we are raising our fiscal year 2013 EPS target to a range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And then the final message is, not dissimilar from what we talked about in September. We do see some market uncertainties, most notably around the federal government and sequestration and also continued macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, and we do have sort of the mid case reflected in the numbers and the targets that we've talked about. 
So let me just going to little more detail on each of those, and then I'll turn the call over to Paul. In terms of our improved financial performance, we reported a 7.7% operating margin, which is significantly better than the same period last year, 289 points better, and this included a restructuring charge of $58 million, which we took as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the company and get us to a stronger financial base with our new operating model. 
The margins before restructuring were 9.2% for the company, 11% for NPS, 8.5% for MSS and 8% for BSS. The earnings per share were $0.83 per share. And again, that's after restructuring. Before restructuring, it was $1.09, and this was much better than a year ago, again, due primarily to our cost takeout efforts, our improved contract focus and, frankly, some favorable comparisons with a year ago. And Paul will go into a little greater detail on the EPS walk-through because there were some items that affected the EPS number. We also delivered $237 million of free cash flow, which represents a year-over-year improvement of $505 million. And this improvement can be attributed to higher net income, reduced capital spending and the $110 million net settlement payment resulting from the Interim Agreement with NHS and of course, the absence of a $265 million repayment that we had to make in the prior year. Total revenue declined about 1% in constant currency from a year ago. We reported a 2% constant currency revenue growth from our commercial segments and a 4% decline in constant currency in our NPS segment. 
Let me move now to a little more detail on the bookings. Bookings for the quarter of $4.2 billion reflected commercial awards of $3.1 billion. And as I said, the total bookings were offset by slow federal awards of $1.1 billion. We had some very significant commercial wins in the quarter, including our applications renewal with Zurich Financial Services. And we've just recently, in early October, we have secured a task order to provide full IT infrastructure support to the FDIC. We were awarded this in early October for $475 million and this will go into the third quarter NPS bookings. 
On a first half basis, our first half commercial awards were $6.2 billion and this is 27% more than the $4.9 billion reported in the first half of our fiscal year 2012. And what is particularly noteworthy is approximately 80% of these awards are either applications, business process outsourcing consulting or Industry Solutions. And this is a result very much consistent with our strategy of trying to move to higher margin offerings. 
As I said, the NPS awards of $2 billion were 50% lower than the $4 billion we reported in the first half of 2012, largely a result of the uncertainty and indecision or lack of decisions regarding where we are from a fiscal standpoint with the government. And our current contract backlog is $34.8 billion and this compares to about $37.5 billion from a year ago. The MSS backlog increased by $1.1 billion. NPS decreased by $1.5 billion and BSS decreased by a little over $2 billion, largely reflecting taking out some of the guarantee backlog associated with NHS. 
My third message here was around our continuing execution of our turnaround strategy and I am very pleased to report that we're seeing tangible improvements to profitability, particularly around our focused accounts. Several accounts are coming off that list and we're adding some new accounts to that. But overall, the profitability is clearly better than it was a year ago. 
As I've said, we've got some accounts coming off that list due to really intense management focus and the use of our economic game plan discipline so that we get closer to achieving the bid models around those contracts. There are some new accounts that we're putting on that watch list. These are accounts where we're delivering fine, we're meeting our service level agreements, but some of these accounts are not on track to meet some of our internal financial targets, so that's why we've put them on the watch list. We are working -- the issues, establishing remediation plans, monitoring the progress. This is really now coming a business discipline and business as usual within CSC as we tighten up how we bid and then how we manage contracts throughout their duration. 
In terms of cost takeout, on a year-to-date basis, we are running ahead of our cost takeout plans. And as you know, those cost takeout plans include improved contract management, which I just talked about, but also workforce optimizations, supply chain and demand management and overhead reductions throughout the enterprise. 
A key focus of that cost takeout work is our workforce optimization and our operating model design work, which is put in place to help streamline CSC as we begin to move from to some places 13 layers of management to 7 or 8 layers of management. And we've got a very disciplined process going layer by layer to align roles and resources and we expect most of this work will be completed by the early part of calendar year 2013. 
The cost takeout work also involves centralizing our key global functions such as HR, finance and marketing, all designed to get better efficiencies and drive unnecessary cost out. And frankly, because we are a little bit ahead of schedule here, this really gives us the confidence to raise our EPS targets for the balance of this fiscal year. 
We continue to strengthen the leadership with experienced proven executives in a lot of our key offerings in sales and staff positions. We named Sashi Reddi to lead our big data and analytics offering. As you may know, Sashi was the founder the CDO of AppLabs. And then in our solutions business, we brought in several new leaders. Roy King leads now our consulting business. Roy's got an extensive background in consulting and PriceWaterhouse and IBM. David now leads our industry software and solutions organization and he has a lot of experience in Oracle, vignette, Siemens and HP. And Peter Espinoza is our new head of sales for our solutions business. And Pete joins us from guide wire, where he previously led sales. And we've also appointed a new head of our Americas region. This is the first time we've had someone focused on this important market for us, and Blake Soleil has joined us to take that position. In our infrastructure business, we've added a couple of new leaders since we last spoke. Al Spencer [ph] leads our client program management and Sal Como [ph] is the new head of our global delivery capability. And from our NPS business, John DeSimone's been hired to lead our mission services unit and he will report to Dave Zolet. And John was formally in public sector with IBM. 
All of these individuals have significant experience and success in the key areas of our business. They know what it means and what it takes to scale a business and create demand and we're really pleased that they joined us. 
In some of our staff functions, we continue to reengineer those staff functions and bring in some extraordinary talent. Tom Colan is our new controller which we're very pleased to have with us; and Charlie Adel is our new Treasurer. And Bryan Robbins, former CFO of VeriSign, has also joined us as Vice President for BSS; and Chris Criner is joining us and will be our new Vice President of finance for our global industries. So we're really bringing a lot of talent in with fantastic credentials. And I think it, from my point of view, is a great sign the CSC is able to attract some of the best talent in the world and we'll need that best talent as we continue to transform the business going forward. 
We're also rationalizing and strengthening our portfolio to try to get us better positioned for next gen infrastructure business, as well as technology solutions and services. We acquired in this period 426 Solutions, which is a big data processing advanced applications firm, which serves the U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Defense. And we're also reshaping our portfolio by divesting of non-core assets. And a week or so ago, we announced the divestiture of the consulting systems integration in certain product-based business in Italy, and we can now focus on bringing CSC's global solutions and services to multinational companies within operations in Italy, so all, again, steps to reposition and fortify our offerings portfolio. 
And as you know, after we did our Analyst Meeting early September, we raised nearly $700 million in senior notes and received commitments for $250 million from a new bank term loan and we have used these proceeds to refinance upcoming maturities. And our actions have resulted in a much smoother debt maturity schedule and a lower cost of debt while improving our credit profile and liquidity position. 
So before I turn this over to Paul, let me just talk a little bit about some of the uncertainty we see, not terribly dissimilar from what we talked about in September. We certainly have the threat of sequestration and the outcome of today's election. All of this has led to significant delays in new business awards in our NPS business. We have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award. It's almost double the amount we had at the same period of time last year. So far, there've been no significant cancellations, but we have had a number of, what I'll call, contract extensions and bridges as we wait for some of this uncertainty around sequestration to lift. And approximately 20% of our bookings in the quarter were these contracts bridges and extensions. 
But even in this current environment, there's an opportunity for CSC as the government mandate for commercial best practices is at a level we just haven't seen before. Cloud, data centers, cyber, big data are all very key things. We had a significant wind with our BizCloud offering in the government this quarter, so there are great opportunities even within this period of uncertainty. 
In terms of Europe, I was in Europe all last week. I was in Germany and France and Switzerland and the U.K., and I can tell you firsthand that there's still a high degree of uncertainty in that market as well. Not only do we see some currency headwinds, but there's a lot of uncertainties, particularly within the financial sector. And I don't think these conditions are unique to CSC, but they do temper our outlook as we go forward here in the second half of the year. 
But all these uncertainties notwithstanding, we are pleased with the results in the quarter and the early progress of our turnaround plans. So we are maintaining our sort of top line outlook here, which was flat to slightly down. And as I said, we are trending ahead of our plan and operating margin EPS and free cash flow, and therefore, we feel it appropriate to raise our target range from the $2.10 to $2.30 to $2.30 to $2.50. 
So our execution of the turnaround plans sort of continues here. We're shaping and streamlining the organizational structure, following through on the cost takeout initiatives, divesting non-core businesses and taking what we think are constructive steps to move up the value chain within our chosen markets. And overall, we are encouraged with this incremental step that we took this quarter. We have a lot to do as we go forward, and the third quarter's always a little weaker quarter sequentially than our second quarter and we've got some issues around the NHS accounting and uncertainty, as I said, in Europe within the federal government. But given our takeout, we feel very confident in raising our full year EPS targets. 
So now, with that, I'll turn it over to Paul, and then we'll open it up for any questions that you may have. Paul?"

On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program and I will just give you some comments -- I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year. On Slide",2096,"Yes, thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program and I will just give you some comments -- I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year. 
On Slide 9, our second quarter results were reported as revenues of approximately $3.85 billion, represent a 3% decline year-over-year, but only a 1% decline in constant currency. Our operating income in the quarter was $298 million and included a workforce restructuring charge of $58 million. Operating margins, as Mike mentioned, were 7.7% in the quarter and were sequentially ahead of our first quarter margin of 4.6% and that reflects the benefit of our cost takeout actions. Year-to-date margins of 6.2% are running at the high end of the range which we provided for the full year. Operating margins improved by 150 basis points year-over-year after adjusting for the U.S. Claims settlement charges in the prior year. 
If you look at diluted EPS, while results were $0.83 per share in the quarter, which compares favorably with the prior year loss of $18.56, in the second quarter of last year, CSC's result included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.21 and a claims charge of $1.20 and those were partially offset by a tax settlement benefit of $0.72 per share. Adjusting for these items, EPS last year would've been $0.14. 
Speaking of taxes, our tax rate in the quarter was 31.7% and 34.8% for the first half of the year. And for the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%. Free cash flow was $237 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $505 million. 
Now let me turn to segment results, starting with our Public Sector business. NPS revenues were $1,038,000,000 in the quarter or approximately 35% of total company revenues. Revenues in NPS declined by 4% year-over-year but were flat on a sequential basis. Revenue from Department of Defense contracts, which accounted for 68% of NPS revenues in the quarter, were down 3% year-over-year. Now it is primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year. Middle agencies accounted for 28% of NPS revenues and declined by nearly 10% year-over-year due primarily to reduced scope on existing contracts and the winding down of other contracts. 
Our NPS revenue's trending in line with our expectations. We continue to expect NPS revenues to be down mid-single digits in fiscal year 2013, reflecting the continued uncertainties surrounding government budgets. NPS operating income was $150 million in the quarter and the operating margins was 10.9%. Second quarter margins are seasonally a high point for our fiscal year. And adjusting for the claims settlement charge in the prior year, margins improved by 160 basis points. 
Our NPS bookings of $1.1 billion were significantly lower than our year-ago period, reflecting delays of new government awards. CSC was awarded a number of smaller contract extensions in the quarter, which in normal time, would have been part of larger, multiyear awards and which would've contributed to much higher bookings. About 58% of our bookings came through our ID/IQ contract vehicles. It was slightly higher than the first quarter and the year-ago quarter. And year-to-date, bookings were $2 billion. 
Now turning now to Slide 11, our Managed Services Sector's revenue were $1.58 billion and accounted for 41% of total company revenues. MSS revenues declined by 2% year-over-year on a reported basis but were up 1% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the Apps acquisitions, which contributed about $25 million of revenue in the quarter. Now this benefit help offset contract completions and modifications. 
MSS operating income was $88 million on a reported basis and $135 million when adjusted for restructuring charges. Operating profit results were driven by strong year-over-year improvement in the profitability of our focus accounts and the benefit of our cost takeout initiatives. Operating margins increased by 280 basis points over the prior year on a reported basis and 570 basis points, excluding restructuring. 
Now for the remainder of the year, we expect MSS to continue to benefit from better contract management discipline, as well as cost takeout actions. And these benefits will be partially offset by investments in new contract startups, investment in offshoring of service delivery and knowledge transfer to low-cost markets. 
Our MSS bookings were $2.2 billion in the quarter, substantially better than a year ago, primarily due to our applications contract with Zurich Financial. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were up 42%. 
So turning to Business Solutions & Services, revenue was $921 million in the quarter or 24% of total company revenues. BSS revenues decreased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis but were up 1% in constant currency. iSOFT contributed $49 million of revenue during the quarter and represented a year-over-year increase of a $17 million. BSS operating income was $64 million before restructuring -- in part from our cost takeout actions. Operating margin improved to 6.9% in the quarter from 3.6% 1 year ago and 1.6% in the first quarter of this year. Our BSS bookings were $900 million in line with the year-ago period, and virtually all of these contracts came from new customers or new scope of work. And on a year-to-date basis, our BSS bookings were unchanged. 
During the quarter, we signed an Interim Agreement with NHS, which established a framework for selling our standardized Lorenzo software modules to all trusts in England. In conjunction with the Interim Agreement, CSC received a payment of $110 million. Now this payment is being amortized over the term of the new agreement, and as a result, the impact on our P&L for this quarter was minimal. 
Now the company has determined that the new NHS agreement should be accounted for under service accounting, which we firmly believe is the most appropriate and the more conservative accounting approach than alternative methods. Now under service accounting, future Lorenzo deployments will impact the P&L when the software is deployed. Now at that time, the revenue and profit will be amortized over the hosting period of the contract, which is expected to be 5 years. 
Now given the history of the NHS program and the complexity of this agreement, we submitted a preclearance letter to the SEC and they are in their final stages of review. Now since we are on this topic, let me update you on the SEC investigation. The SEC is continuing its investigation regarding their concern over prior NHS accounting and related disclosures. Now the company, the audit committee and its independent counsel are investigating these matters and are continuing to cooperate with this investigation, and we will keep you updated on this matter. 
Now let me turn to Slide 13 and talk about our cash flow performance in the quarter. As you can see, free cash flow was $237 million for the quarter compared with an outflow of $268 million in the prior year. Now this represents a $505 million year-over-year improvement in cash flow. Now this turnaround can be attributed to improved operating profitability, better working capital management and the benefit of the $110 million payment received from NHS. 
Capital expenditures declined by $55 million year-over-year, reflecting our new capital allocation discipline. On a year-to-date basis, CapEx was $365 million, a decline of 30% from the prior year. And year-to-date CapEx and capital lease payments were 6.2% of revenue as compared to 8% for the prior year. 
On Slide 15, we highlight a few balance sheet item. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.85 billion, which includes $700 million from our refinancing activities in September. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3 billion. DSOs, days sales outstanding, were 72 days, an improvement of 14 days year-over-year. And the DSOs excluding unbilled receivables were approximately 41 days, in line with our first quarter results at 7 days better than the prior year. 
Also shown on this slide is our revised maturity schedule which was updated to reflect the redemption of our maturing debt, which took place in October. As previously announced, CSC raised $350 million of 3-year notes with a coupon of 2.5%, $350 million of 10-year notes at 4.45% and those are shown on the purple bars on the graph. Subsequent to the quarter, we raised $250 million from a new 4-year bank term loan, which had a floating-rate interest of LIBOR plus 187 basis points or 2.2% currently. Now this is part of our strategy of diversifying our funding sources. Now we use the proceeds of these offerings to redeem early the $1 billion of debt coming due in 2013. By taking these actions, we're smoothing out our debt maturities, lowering our cost of debt and strengthening our credit profile while maintaining ample access to liquidity. 
The P&L impact of redeeming the maturing notes early will result in a $19 million pretax charge in the third quarter, which will be partially offset by lower average interest expenses for the remainder of the year. Our refinancing actions will lower interest expense by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. 
Now let me update you on our cost takeout program. Without any plan to take $1 billion to $1.2 billion of costs out of our cost structures by 2014, with $500 million to $600 million coming in the current fiscal year. Now we expect the savings to come from 4 areas, which are shown on the slide. First, in supply chain and procurements, we're implementing category sourcing plans for key procurement activities. We're consolidating our process with fewer vendors and we're instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors. 
Now you should know that we recently entered into a strategic sourcing arrangement with 2 partners to purchase their products and solution under a utility or consumption-based model. Now these types of agreements are in line with our stated objective of reducing the capital intensity of our business. 
Second, we are making progress on our workforce optimization which completed the restructuring plan which were initiated late last year for the U.K., Germany and the Nordics. Now we're going through a process now of eliminating layers of management as we roll out our new operating model. We're about halfway through this process. As discussed at our Investor Day meeting, our aim is to reduce managerial layers from 13 to 8 and expand managerial span of control to an average of 8 direct reports. 
The third area of opportunity for cost takeout is reducing enterprise overheads or streamlining our corporate and business unit functions for 0 basing activities at corporate and across business sectors and geographies and we are going to be benchmarking our cost against best-in-class companies. 
And fourth, we continue to make significant progress in contract management. Mike alluded to that in his remarks. We have a tighter bid review process and we're tracking results against did models and timelines. And for the first half of the year, the profitability of our focus accounts has improved by approximately $110 million so we are well on our way to our goal of $100 million to $200 million for uptake cost of cost improvement or profitability improvement for fiscal year 2013. 
Now halfway through our fiscal year, we've realized approximately $280 million of the $500 million to $600 million in cost takeouts. So we're making good progress and we're trending toward the high-end of our target. These savings are helping us fund reinvestments, which include customer-committed savings, enterprise tools and systems, sales and go-to-market initiatives and workforce restructuring, as well as the investments associated with knowledge transfers to low-cost markets. Now we expect our reinvestments to be at the high-end of our $200 million to $250 million range of fiscal year 2013. 
So based on our first half results, our operating performance is steadily improving and we're making good progress on our cost takeout initiatives. As their results, we are raising our target earnings per share to $2.30 to $2.50 for fiscal year 2013, up from our prior range of $2.10 to $2.30. As Mike mentioned, we expect Q3 to be impacted sequentially by seasonal trends, NHS accounting and the timing of some of our reinvestments. We're still assuming an effective tax rate of 32% to 36% for the year and our target now for free cash flow is $400 million to $450 million, an increase from our previous range of $300 million to $350 million. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

I mean, the biggest expense we had reinvestment, if you will, in the second quarter was the restructuring charge of $58 million, if I remember correctly. So that was the biggest single investment, and that's obviously helping us then achieve an operating expense run rate lower than we had in the first quarter. I still think we're, as Paul said, we're sort of are at the high-end range here of the cost takeout for the full year, so I don't want to declare anything more than that. We are slightly ahead, but a lot of this as a result of some actions we took at the end of last fiscal year around the restructuring, particularly of the U.K. and Germany and the Nordics. And those teams did a great job executing that part and we're seeing the benefits in our run rate now. I would also say we've made some good early gains in procurement as we've centralized procurement and got some standardized contracts in place and some standardized buying around the world. So you get sort of an initial blip in terms of cost reduction when you put that in place. And then that begins to moderate as you move forward and get to a more of a steady-state run rate. So I think Paul's calling it right here. I think we're at the high-end here of the cost takeout this fiscal year and we're at the high-end of the reinvestment. Most of that reinvestment has come around restructuring charges today. We will be making some reinvestment, particularly in our systems, our financial systems. We are going to begin to invest in some go-to-market or demand generation activities, particularly salespeople, as we see that demand pick up in areas like cloud and cyber, for example, and even some geographic areas. So I think we've got this call pretty much the way we see it right now."

There's a lot of, what I'll call, hype, but a lot of discussion around cloud. And what Paul and I wanted to get comfortable with is the economic model that supports cloud. Because the hypothesis here is, that as we begin to deliver infrastructure services more as a service or from the cloud, we want to make sure there is an existent -- that says we will get higher margins, higher contribution and we do from our existing infrastructure business. And we boil this down to 2 fundamental things. One is the capacity to of the compute and storage facility in the cloud, and we understand that now, we understand where we break even. It is a geometric progression as you begin to get more capacity utilized. And then the second thing is the labor to support that capacity. It's a very important that, that labor cost come from lower-cost areas around the world. And if you manage those 2 variables well, then there is an opportunity to have significant higher contribution to profit from the revenue associated with that. So where we are now is we are much more now in the mode of demand generation. So we're comfortable with the economic model, we've got a lot of this infrastructure in place and now it comes time to begin to sell. Gartner just put us in the leader's quadrant for our cloud infrastructure offerings, so we're really going to begin to try to push the accelerator here on the demand generation side."

But that all pretty balances out. I think the way you characterize it is how I think about it. From an operational standpoint, it's roughly $100 million improvement and the rest was NHS and the fact that we didn't have to make a repayment this quarter as we did in the previous quarter in 2012."

And we'll probably have some restructuring as we finish up this year and do our delayering rework. Yes, you always have some restructuring. You have contracts that expire and people go off of that, but we're fundamentally trying to get to a more streamlined organization. We have more overhead than we need in this company at every level, at our regional level, at our headquarters level, and that is coming out. We have got -- I just don't think we need 13 layers of management between the client and me, and that's coming out. So those actions do contribute to a higher restructuring run rate right now and I don't see those things repeating unless we get sloppy in our discipline in the years ahead and build that overhead structure back in, which I've got no intention of doing because we're going to benchmark ourselves against the best-of-breed in our industry and stay on those benchmarks. So again, the run rate on restructuring expenses is higher than I expected to be on an ongoing basis, but I do expect that higher-than-normal run rate on restructuring to continue for several more quarters as we clean up the business."

One, the reason we're seeing a fair amount of improvement early on here is just flat-out discipline and focus. That's all it is, just focus. I'm on this stuff every other week. We've got a management system in place now, you ask questions, you put actions in place, you follow up to make sure those actions are taken. This is just good old-fashioned business 101 discipline, and that gives you a real bump. Now in order to make that sustainable, you then need to make systemic changes and that revolves around our bid models. So we've just rolled out a whole new delegation of authority throughout the business, so we understand at what levels of the business we're going to take what risks and those are all more systemic changes to the model that will allow us a more consistent disciplined approach to contract management as we go forward. In terms of conversations with our clients, they range the gamut. Sometimes we amend the contract for a little less revenue but more profitability. Other times, we get an agreement to expand the scope, or in some cases, as we've gone through these contracts, we found that we haven't built all of the scope changes that we should've built. So then when go to the customers and say, gee, we haven't built these, we're going to build them now. So those conversations run the gamut of the different levers that we have to improve profitability. But it's not just about improving profitability. It's about improving value, the value that we delivered to the client. So this isn't about, let me just go figure out how to make more money, this is about how do we add more value to our clients and then in the process be more profitable. So that's the genesis of the discussion with the clients, is what can we do to help them, and in helping our clients, we drive more profitability for our shareholders at the same time. So it's a 2-way street."

And then you have to have a management team that is proactive, recognizes those early warning signals and then goes out and does something about it as opposed to just watching it happen, sort of like defensive driving. You need to proactively deal with these things, but the key thing is around trying to maintain client goodwill, doing what's right for them and in turn doing what's right for CSC.

And so I would suspect that will just have a slight benefit from that in the second half of the year on a net basis. We will do better on our cost takeout net of the reinvestments that we are making. Some of the headwinds that we would have is there's some seasonality in our MSS business in the third quarter, then it kind of comes back in the fourth quarter. The other thing is our NHS new accounting. As what I mentioned to you, this is now going to be accounted under service accounting. And as a result of that, if I were to look at the entire contribution from NHS in the first quarter, this is Lorenzo, a non-Lorenzo part, that would be a -- we were slightly positive in the first half of the year. If we include again all of the business that we do with the NHS in the second half of the year, we will be operating closer to breakeven. And so when you net all of these things out, you get back to what we gave you as the guidance, which is sequentially third quarter would be a little weaker than it was in the second quarter figure and then it will pick up again in the fourth quarter. And for the total year, we will be at the $2.30 to $2.50 range in EPS."

So we're beginning to go out and recruit people into our cloud offerings, likewise with cyber, where we're seeing some success in demand and also with big data. The other area's cross-sell. I think I mentioned when we were together in September, with all of our global 1,000 accounts, we only cross-sell into about 12% of those. So we're changing how we approach that because if you have a happy client that you're delivering value to, it's an easier place to go sell additional services and capability to. Zurich Financial Services would be an example of that. And then there's certain geographic regions that we see growth. We see good growth right now in the commercial sector in the United States. We see growth opportunities in parts of Asia. But we're going to target these investments in sales in particular in those areas where we see and are very comfortable with the trend line, and we have factored that into the projections that we have communicated today."

Hello to everyone on the call. Thanks for your interest in CSC. As you know, we issued our second quarter results earlier this morning, and I'm joined by Paul Saleh, and he and I will take you through those results and also provide a quick update on some of the other key initiatives that we're executing against to continue to drive improvement in CSC's financial performance.
I really want to leave you with 4 key messages today, and then I'll develop each of those messages a little bit. But the first message is our solid Q2 results reflect continuing financial improvement, primarily driven by our cost takeout efforts and better contract management.
The second message is we had strong commercial bookings in the quarter, but a lot of the uncertainty in the federal market was a drag on our total bookings and that certainly impacted our NPS bookings.
The third message is our turnaround activities that we talked about in September when we were together are gathering pace, and we are beginning to see tangible results of this throughout the business. And as a result of that, we are raising our fiscal year 2013 EPS target to a range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share.
And then, the final message is, not dissimilar from what we talked about in September, we do see some market uncertainties, most notably around the federal government and sequestration and also continued macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, and we do have sort of the mid case reflected in the numbers and the targets that we've talked about.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those, and then I'll turn the call over to Paul. In terms of our improved financial performance, we reported a 7.7% operating margin, which is significantly better than the same period last year, 289 points better. And this included a restructuring charge of $58 million, which we took as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the company and get us to a stronger financial base with our new operating model.
The margins before restructuring were 9.2% for the company, 11% for NPS, 8.5% for MSS and 8% for BSS. The earnings per share were $0.83 per share. And again, if you -- that's after restructuring. Before restructuring, it was $1.09, and this was much better than a year ago, again, due primarily to our cost takeout efforts, our improved contract focus and, frankly, some favorable comparisons with a year ago. And Paul will go into a little greater detail on the EPS walk-through because there were some items that affected the EPS number.
We also delivered $237 million of free cash flow, which represents a year-over-year improvement of $505 million. And this improvement can be attributed to higher net income, reduced capital spending and the $110 million net settlement payment resulting from the interim agreement with NHS and, of course, the absence of a $265 million repayment that we had to make in the prior year. Total revenue declined about 1% in constant currency from a year ago. We reported a 2% constant currency revenue growth from our commercial segments and a 4% decline in constant currency in our NPS segment.
Let me move now to a little more detail on the bookings. Bookings for the quarter of $4.2 billion reflected commercial awards of $3.1 billion. And as I said, the total bookings were offset by slow federal awards of $1.1 billion. We had some very significant commercial wins in the quarter, including our applications renewal with Zurich Financial Services. And we've just recently -- in early October, we have secured a task order to provide full IT infrastructure support to the FDIC. We were awarded this in early October for $475 million, and this will go into the third quarter NPS bookings.
On a first half basis, our first half commercial awards were $6.2 billion, and this is 27% more than the $4.9 billion we reported in the first half of our fiscal year 2012. And what is particularly noteworthy is approximately 80% of these awards are either applications, business process outsourcing, consulting or industry solutions. And this is a result and very much consistent with our strategy of trying to move to higher margin offerings.
As I said, the NPS awards of $2 billion were 50% lower than the $4 billion we reported in the first half of 2012, largely a result of the uncertainty and indecision -- or lack of decisions regarding where we are from a fiscal standpoint with the government. And our current contract backlog is $34.8 billion, and this compares to about $37.5 billion from a year ago. The MSS backlog increased by $1.1 billion. NPS decreased by $1.5 billion, and BSS decreased by a little over $2 billion, largely reflecting taking out some of the guarantee backlog associated with NHS.
My third message here was around our continuing execution of our turnaround strategy, and I am very pleased to report that we're seeing tangible improvements to profitability, particularly around our focused accounts. Several accounts are coming off that list, and we're adding some new accounts to that. But overall, the profitability is clearly better than it was a year ago. As I said, we've got some accounts coming off that list due to really intense management focus and the use of our economic game plan discipline, so that we get closer to achieving the bid models around those contracts.
There are some new accounts that we're putting on that watch list. These are accounts where we're delivering fine, we're meeting our service level agreements, but some of these accounts are not on track to meet some of our internal financial targets. So that's why we put them on the watch list. We're working the issues, establishing remediation plans, monitoring the progress. This is really now becoming a business discipline and business as usual within CSC, as we tighten up how we bid and then how we manage contracts throughout their duration.
In terms of cost takeout, on a year-to-date basis, we are running ahead of our cost takeout plans. And as you know, those cost takeout plans include improved contract management, which I just talked about; but also workforce optimizations, supply chain and demand management; and overhead reductions throughout the enterprise.
A key focus of that cost takeout work is our workforce optimization and our operating model design work, which is put in place to help streamline CSC as we begin to move from, in some places, 13 layers of management to 7 or 8 layers of management. And we've got a very disciplined process, going layer by layer to align roles and resources, and we expect most of this work will be completed by the early part of calendar year 2013. The cost takeout work also involves centralizing our key global functions such as HR, finance and marketing, all designed to get better efficiencies and drive unnecessary costs out. And frankly, because we are a little bit ahead of schedule here, this really gives us the confidence to raise our EPS targets for the balance of this fiscal year.
We continue to strengthen the leadership with experienced proven executives in a lot of our key offerings in sales and staff positions. We named Sashi Reddi to lead our big data and analytics offering. As you may know, Sashi was the founder and the CEO of AppLabs. And in our solutions business, we brought in several new leaders. Roy King leads now our consulting business. Roy's got an extensive background in consulting in Pricewaterhouse and IBM. Dave Shirk now leads our industry software and solutions organization, and he's -- has a lot of experience in Oracle, Vignette, Siemens and HP. And Peter Espinosa is our new head of sales for our solutions business. And Pete joins us from Guidewire, where he previously led sales. And we've also appointed a new head of our Americas region. This is the first time we've had someone focused on this important market for us, and Blake Soley [ph] has joined us to take that position.
In our infrastructure business, we've added a couple of new leaders since we last spoke. Al Spencer [ph] leads our client program management, and Sal Como is the new head of our global delivery capability. And from our NPS business, John DeSimone has been hired to lead our mission services unit, and he will report to Dave Zolet. John was formally in public sector with IBM. All of these individuals have significant experience and success in the key areas of our business. They know what it means and what it takes to scale a business and create demand, and we're really pleased that they joined us.
In some of our staff functions, we continue to reengineer those staff functions and bring in some extraordinary talent. Tom Colan is our new controller, which we're very pleased to have with us. And Charlie Adel [ph] is our new treasurer. And Brian Robins, former CFO of VeriSign, has also joined us as the vice president for BSS; and Chris Criner [ph] is joining us and will be our new vice president of finance for our global industries. So we're really bringing a lot of talent in with fantastic credentials. And I think it's -- from my point of view, is a great sign the CSC is able to attract some of the best talent in the world, and we'll need that best talent as we continue to transform the business going forward.
We're also rationalizing and strengthening our portfolio to try to get us better positioned for next gen infrastructure business, as well as technology solutions and services. We acquired in this period 42Six Solutions, which is a big data processing and advanced applications firm, which serves the U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Defense. And we're also reshaping our portfolio by divesting of non-core assets. In a week or so ago, we announced the divestiture of the consulting systems integration in certain product-based businesses in Italy, and we can now focus on bringing CSC's global solutions and services to multi-national companies within operations in Italy, so all, again, steps to reposition and fortify our offerings portfolio.
And as you know, after we did our Analyst Meeting in early September, we raised nearly $700 million in senior notes and received commitments for $250 million from a new bank term loan, and we have used these proceeds to refinance upcoming maturities. And our actions have resulted in a much smoother debt maturity schedule and a lower cost of debt, while improving our credit profile and liquidity position.
So before I turn this over to Paul, let me just talk a little bit about some of the uncertainty we see. Not terribly dissimilar from what we talked about in September, we certainly have the threat of sequestration and the outcome of today's election, all of this has led to significant delays in new business awards in our NPS business. We have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award. It's almost double the amount we had at the same period of time last year. So far, there've been no significant cancellations, but we have had a number of, what I'll call, contract extensions and bridges as we wait for some of this uncertainty around sequestration to lift, and approximately 20% of our bookings in the quarter were these contract bridges and extensions.
But even in this current environment, there's an opportunity for CSC as the government mandate for commercial best practices at a level we just haven't seen before. Cloud, data centers, Cyber, Big Data are all very key things. We had some significant -- a significant win with our BizCloud offering in the government this quarter. So there are great opportunities even within this period of uncertainty.
In terms of Europe, I was in Europe all last week. I was in Germany and France and Switzerland and the U.K., and I can tell you firsthand that there's still a high degree of uncertainty in that market as well. Not only do we see some currency headwinds, but there's a lot of uncertainties, particularly within the financial sector. And I don't think these conditions are unique to CSC, but they do temper our outlook as we go forward here in the second half of the year.
But all these uncertainties notwithstanding, we are pleased with the results in the quarter and the early progress of our turnaround plans. So we were maintaining our, sort of, top line outlook here, which was flat to slightly down. And as I said, we are trending ahead of our plan on operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. And therefore, we feel it appropriate to raise our target range from the $2.10 to $2.30, to $2.30 to $2.50.
So our execution of the turnaround plans sort of continues here. We're shaping and streamlining the organizational structure, following through on the cost takeout initiatives, divesting non-core businesses and taking what we think are constructive steps to move up the value chain within our chosen markets. And overall, we are encouraged with this incremental step that we took this quarter. We have a lot to do as we go forward, and the third quarter is always a little weaker quarter sequentially than our second quarter. And we've got some issues around the NHS accounting and uncertainty, as I said, in Europe and within the federal government. But given our takeout work, we feel very confident in raising our full year EPS targets.
So now, with that, I'll turn it over to Paul, and then we'll open it up for any questions that you may have. Paul?"

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program, and I will just give you some comment. I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year.On Slide 9,",2107,"Yes. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program, and I will just give you some comment. I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year.
On Slide 9, our second quarter results were reported as revenues of approximately $3.85 billion, representing a 3% decline year-over-year, but only a 1% decline in constant currency. Our operating income in the quarter was $298 million and included a workforce restructuring charge of $58 million. Operating margins, as Mike mentioned, were 7.7% in the quarter and were sequentially ahead of our first quarter margin of 4.6%, and that reflects the benefit of our cost takeout actions. Year-to-date margins of 6.2% are running at the high end of the range, which we provided for the full year. Operating margins improved by 150 basis points year-over-year after adjusting for the U.S. claims settlement charges in the prior year.
If you look at diluted EPS, our results were $0.83 per share in the quarter, which compares favorably with the prior year loss of $18.56. In the second quarter of last year, CSC's results included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.21 and a claims charge of $1.20, and those were partially offset by a tax settlement benefit of $0.72 per share. Adjusting for these items, EPS last year would have been $0.14.
Speaking of taxes, our tax rate in the quarter was 31.7% and 34.8% for the first half of the year. And for the full year, we continue to expect of an effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%. Free cash flow was $237 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $505 million.
Now let me turn to segment results, starting with our Public Sector business. NPS revenues were $1,038,000,000 in the quarter or approximately 35% of total company revenues. Revenues in NPS declined by 4% year-over-year, but were flat on a sequential basis. Revenue from Department of Defense contracts, which accounted for 68% of NPS revenues in the quarter, were down 3% year-over-year. Now it is primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year. Middle [ph] agencies accounted for 28% of NPS revenues and declined by nearly 10% year-over-year due primarily to reduced scope on existing contracts and the winding down of other contracts.
Our NPS revenue is trending in line with our expectations. Now we continue to expect NPS revenues to be down mid-single digits in fiscal year 2013, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets. NPS operating income was $150 million in the quarter, and the operating margins was 10.9%. Second quarter margins are seasonally a high point for our fiscal year. And adjusting for the claims settlement charge in the prior year, margins improved by 160 basis points.
Our NPS bookings of $1.1 billion were significantly lower than a year-ago period, reflecting delays of new government awards. CSC was awarded a number of smaller contract extensions in the quarter, which in normal time, would have been part of larger, multi-year awards and which would have contributed to much higher bookings. About 58% of our bookings came through our ID/IQ contract vehicles, which was slightly higher than the first quarter and the year-ago quarter, and year-to-date bookings were $2 billion.
Now turning now to Slide 11, our Managed Services Sector's revenue were $1.58 billion and accounted for 41% of total company revenues. MSS revenues declined by 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, but were up 1% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the AppLabs acquisitions, which contributed about $25 million of revenue in the quarter. Now this benefit helped offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income was $88 million on a reported basis and $135 million when adjusted for restructuring charges. Operating profit results were driven by strong year-over-year improvement in the profitability of our focus accounts and the benefit of our cost takeout initiatives. Operating margins increased by 280 basis points over the prior year on a reported basis and 570 basis points, excluding restructuring.
Now for the remainder of the year, we expect MSS to continue to benefit from better contract management discipline, as well as cost takeout actions. And these benefits will be partially offset by investments in new contract startups, investment in off-shoring of service delivery and knowledge transfer to low-cost markets. Our MSS bookings were $2.2 billion in the quarter, substantially better than a year ago, primarily due to our applications contract with Zurich Financial. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were up 42%.
Now turning to Business Solutions & Services, revenue was $921 million in the quarter or 24% of total company revenues. BSS revenues decreased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, but were up 1% in constant currency. iSOFT contributed $49 million of revenue during the quarter and represented a year-over-year increase of a $17 million. BSS operating income was $64 million before restructuring, benefiting in part from our cost takeout actions. Operating margin improved to 6.9% in the quarter from 3.6% 1 year ago and 1.6% in the first quarter of this year. Our BSS bookings were $900 million, in line with the year-ago period. And virtually, all of these contracts came from new customers or new scope of work. And on a year-to-date basis, our BSS bookings were unchanged.
During the quarter, we signed an interim agreement with NHS, which established a framework for selling [ph] our standardized Lorenzo software modules to all trusts in England. In conjunction with the interim agreement, CSC received a payment of $110 million. Now this payment is being amortized over the term of the new agreement. And as a result, the impact on our P&L for this quarter was minimal.
Now the company has determined that the new NHS agreement should be accounted for under service accounting, which we firmly believe is the most appropriate and the more conservative accounting approach than alternative methods. Now under service accounting, future Lorenzo deployments will impact the P&L when the software is deployed. Now at that time, the revenue and profit will be amortized over the hosting period of the contract, which is expected to be 5 years.
Now given the history of the NHS program and the complexity of this agreement, we submitted a pre-clearance letter to the SEC, and they are in their final stages of review. Now since we're on this topic, let me update you on the SEC investigation. The SEC is continuing its investigation regarding their concern over prior NHS accounting and related disclosures. Now the company, the audit committee and its independent council are investigating these matters and are continuing to cooperate with this investigation. And we will keep you updated on this matter.
Now let me turn to Slide 13 and talk about our cash flow performance in the quarter. As you can see, free cash flow was $237 million for the quarter compared with an outflow of $268 million in the prior year. Now this represents a $505 million year-over-year improvement in cash flow. Now this turnaround can be attributed to improved operating profitability, better working capital management and the benefit of the $110 million payment received from NHS.
Capital expenditures declined by $55 million year-over-year, reflecting our new capital allocation discipline. On a year-to-date basis, CapEx was $365 million, a decline of 30% from the prior year. And year-to-date CapEx and capital lease payments were 6.2% of revenue as compared to 8% for the prior year.
On Slide 15 (sic) [ Slide 14], we highlight a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.85 billion, which includes $700 million from our refinancing activities in September. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3 billion. DSOs, days sales outstanding, were 72 days, an improvement of 14 days year-over-year. And the DSOs, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 41 days, in line with our first quarter results at 7 days better than the prior year. Also shown on this slide is our revised maturity schedule, which was updated to reflect the redemption of our maturing debt, which took place in October.
As previously announced, CSC raised $350 million of 3-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $350 million of 10-year notes at 4.45%, and those are shown on the purple bars on the graph. Subsequent to the quarter, we raised $350 [ph] million from a new 4-year bank term loan, which had a floating-rate interest of LIBOR plus 187 basis points or 2.2% currently. Now this is part of our strategy of diversifying our funding sources. Now we used the proceeds of these offerings to redeem early the $1 billion of debt coming due in 2013. By taking these actions, we're smoothing out our debt maturities, lowering our cost of debt and strengthening our credit profile while maintaining ample access to liquidity. The P&L impact of redeeming the maturing notes early will result in a $19 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter, which will be partially offset by lower average interest expenses for the remainder of the year. Our refinancing actions will lower interest expense by approximately $20 million on an annual basis.
Now let me update you on our cost takeout program. We've outlined a plan to take $1 billion to $1.2 billion of costs out of our cost structures by 2014, with $500 million to $600 million coming in the current fiscal year. Now we expect the savings to come from 4 areas, which are shown on the slide. First, in supply chain and procurement, we're implementing category sourcing plans for key procurement activities. We're consolidating our purchases with fewer vendors, and we're instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors.
Now you should know that we recently entered into a strategic sourcing arrangement with 2 partners to purchase their products and solution under a utility or consumption-based model. Now these types of agreements are aligned with our stated objective of reducing the capital intensity of our business.
Second, we're making progress on our workforce optimization which completed the restructuring plan, which were initiated late last year for the U.K., Germany and the Nordics. And we're going through a process now of eliminating layers of management as we roll out our new operating model. We're about halfway through this process. As discussed at our Investor Day meeting, our aim is to reduce managerial layers from 13 to 8 and expand managerial span of control to an average of 8 direct reports.
The third area of opportunity for cost takeout is reducing enterprise overheads or streamlining our corporate and business unit functions, we're zero-basing activities at corporate and across business sectors and geographies and we are going to be benchmarking our cost against best-in-class companies.
And fourth, we continue to make significant progress in contract management. Mike alluded to that in his remarks. We have a tighter bid review process, and we're tracking results against bid models and timelines. And for the first half of the year, the profitability of our focus accounts has improved by approximately $110 million, so we're well on our way to our goal of $100 million to $200 million for uptake cost -- of cost improvement -- or profitability improvement for fiscal year 2013.
Now halfway through our fiscal year, we've realized approximately $280 million of the $500 million to $600 million in cost takeout. So we're making good progress, and we're trending toward the high end of our target. These savings are helping us fund reinvestments, which include customer-committed savings, enterprise tools and systems, sales and go-to-market initiatives and workforce restructuring, as well as the investment associated with knowledge transfers to low-cost markets. Now we expect our reinvestments to be at the high-end of our $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal year 2013.
So based on our first half results, our operating performance is steadily improving, and we're making good progress on our cost takeout initiatives. As a result, we are raising our target earnings per share to $2.30 to $2.50 for fiscal year 2013, up from a prior range of $2.10 to $2.30. As Mike mentioned, we expect Q3 to be impacted sequentially by seasonal trends, NHS accounting and the timing of some of our reinvestments. We're still assuming an effective tax rate of 32% to 36% for the year. And our target now for free cash flow is $400 million to $450 million, an increase from our previous range of $300 million to $350 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

Are we going to move into the more of that $1 billion to $1.2 billion this year? Secondly, I know that during the Investor Day, Mike, you had mentioned reinvesting, I think, was around 75% of that 25% passing through. I know you again mentioned you did see around $200 million, $250 million reinvested, but how much actually was reinvested in this quarter because based on the margin expansion, it looks like a lot of it passed through to the bottom line?"

I mean, the biggest expense we had in reinvestment, if you will, in the second quarter was the restructuring charge of $58 million, if I remember it correctly. So that was the biggest single investment, and that's obviously helping us then achieve an operating expense run rate lower than we had in the first quarter. I still think we're -- as Paul said, we're sort of are at the high range here of the cost takeout for the full year, so I don't want to declare anything more than that. We are slightly ahead, but a lot of that is a result of some actions we took at the end of last fiscal year around the restructuring, particularly at the U.K. and Germany and the Nordics. And those teams did a great job executing that part, and we're seeing the benefits in our run rate now. I would also say we've made some good early gains in procurement as we've centralized procurement and got some standardized contracts in place and some standardized buying around the world. So you get sort of an initial blip in terms of cost reduction when you put that in place, and then that begins to moderate as you move forward and get to a more of a steady-state run rate. So I think Paul has called it right here. I think we're at the high end here of the cost takeout this fiscal year, and we're at the high end of the reinvestment. Most of that reinvestment has come around restructuring charges to date. We will be making some reinvestment, particularly in our systems, our financial systems. We are going to begin to invest in some go-to-market or demand generation activities, particularly sales people, as we see that demand pick up in areas like cloud and Cyber, for example, and even some geographic areas. So I think we've got this called pretty much the way we see it right now."

There's a lot of -- I won't call it hype, but a lot of discussion around cloud. And what Paul and I want to get comfortable with is the economic model that supports cloud. Because the hypothesis here is that as we begin to deliver infrastructure services more as a service or from the cloud, we want to make sure there is an existence theorem that says we will get higher margins, higher contribution that we do from our existing infrastructure business. And we boil this down to 2 fundamental things: One is the capacity of the compute and storage facility in the cloud, and we understand that now. We understand where we breakeven. It is a geometric progression as you begin to get more capacity utilized. And then the second thing is the labor to support that compute capacity. It's very important that, that labor cost come from lower-cost areas around the world. And if you manage those 2 variables well, then there is an opportunity to have significant higher contribution to profit from the revenue associated with that. So where we are now is we are much more now in the mode of demand generation. So we're comfortable with the economic model. We've got a lot of this infrastructure in place. And now, it comes time to begin to sell. Gartner just put us in the leaders' quadrant for our cloud infrastructure offerings, so we're really going to begin to try to push the accelerator here on the demand generation side."

We have got -- I just don't think we need 13 layers of management between the client and me, and that's coming out. So that -- those actions do contribute to a higher restructuring run rate right now, and I don't see those things repeating unless we get sloppy in our discipline in the years ahead and build that overhead structure back in, which I've got no intention of doing because we're going to benchmark ourselves against the best-of-breed in our industry and stay on those benchmarks.

One, the reason we're seeing a fair amount of improvement early on here is just flat-out discipline and focus. It's all it is, just focus. I'm on this stuff every other week. We've got a management system in place now. You ask questions. You put actions in place. You follow up to make sure those actions are taken. This is just good old-fashioned business 101 discipline, and that gives you a real bump. Now in order to make that sustainable, you then need to make systemic changes, and that revolves around our bid models. So we've just rolled out a whole new delegation of authority throughout the business, so we understand at what levels of the business we're going to take what risks, and those are all more systemic changes to the model that will allow us a more consistent disciplined approach to contract management as we go forward. In terms of conversations with our clients, they range to gamuts. Sometimes, we amend the contract for a little less revenue, but more profitability. Other times, we get an agreement to expand the scope or, in some cases, as we've gone through these contracts, we found that we haven't built all of the scope changes that we should have built. So then, we go to the customers and say, ""Gee, we haven't built these. We're going to build them now."" So those conversations run the gamut of the different levers that we have to improve profitability. But it's not just about improving profitability, it's about improving value, the value that we deliver to the client. So this isn't about, ""Let me just go figure out how to make more money,"" this is about how do we add more value to our clients and in the process be more profitable. So that's the genesis of the discussion with the clients is what can we do to help them. And in helping our clients, we drive more profitability for our shareholders at the same time. So it's a two-way street."

And then, you have to have a management team that is proactive, recognizes those early warning signals and then goes out and does something about it as opposed to just watching it happen. Sort of, like defensive driving, you need to proactively deal with these things.

The other thing is our NHS new accounting. As I mentioned to you, this is going to be now accounted under service accounting. And as a result of that, if I were to look at the entire contribution from NHS in the first quarter, this is Lorenzo, a non-Lorenzo part, that would be a -- we were slightly positive in the first half of the year. If we include again all of the business that we do with the NHS in the second half of the year, we will be operating closer to breakeven.

So we're beginning to go out and recruit people into our cloud offerings, likewise with Cyber, where we're seeing some success in demand and also with Big Data. The other area is cross-sell. I think I mentioned, when we were together in September, of all of our global 1,000 accounts, we only cross-sell into about 12% of those. So we're changing how we approach that because if you have a happy client that you're delivering value to, it's an easier place to go sell additional services and capability to. Zurich Financial Services would be an example of that. And then, there's certain theaters [ph], the geographic regions that we see growth. We see good growth right now in the commercial sector in the United States. We see growth opportunities in parts of Asia. So we're going to target these investments in sales, in particular, in those areas where we see and are very comfortable with the trend line, and we have factored that into the projections that we have communicated today."

Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Hello to everyone on the call. Thanks for your interest in CSC. As you know, we issued our second quarter results earlier this morning, and I'm joined by Paul Saleh, and he and I will take you through those result",2299,"Okay. Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Hello to everyone on the call. Thanks for your interest in CSC. As you know, we issued our second quarter results earlier this morning, and I'm joined by Paul Saleh, and he and I will take you through those results and also provide a quick update on some of the other key initiatives that we're executing against to continue to drive improvement in CSC's financial performance.
I really want to leave you with 4 key messages today, and then I'll develop each of those messages a little bit. But the first message is our solid Q2 results reflect continuing financial improvement, primarily driven by our cost takeout efforts and better contract management.
The second message is we had strong commercial bookings in the quarter, but a lot of the uncertainty in the federal market was a drag on our total bookings and that certainly impacted our NPS bookings.
The third message is our turnaround activities that we talked about in September when we were together are gathering pace, and we are beginning to see tangible results of this throughout the business. And as a result of that, we are raising our fiscal year 2013 EPS target to a range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share.
And then the final message is, not dissimilar from what we talked about in September, we do see some market uncertainties, most notably around the federal government and sequestration and also continued macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, and we do have sort of the mid case reflected in the numbers and the targets that we've talked about.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those, and then I'll turn the call over to Paul. In terms of our improved financial performance, we reported a 7.7% operating margin, which is significantly better than the same period last year, 289 points better. And this included a restructuring charge of $58 million, which we took as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the company and get us to a stronger financial base with our new operating model.
The margins before restructuring were 9.2% for the company, 11% for NPS, 8.5% for MSS and 8% for BSS. The earnings per share were $0.83 per share. And again, if you -- that's after restructuring. Before restructuring, it was $1.09, and this was much better than a year ago, again, due primarily to our cost takeout efforts, our improved contract focus and, frankly, some favorable comparisons with a year ago. And Paul will go into a little greater detail on the EPS walk-through because there were some items that affected the EPS number.
We also delivered $237 million of free cash flow, which represents a year-over-year improvement of $505 million. And this improvement can be attributed to higher net income, reduced capital spending and the $110 million net settlement payment resulting from the interim agreement with NHS and, of course, the absence of a $265 million repayment that we had to make in the prior year. Total revenue declined about 1% in constant currency from a year ago. We reported a 2% constant currency revenue growth from our commercial segments and a 4% decline in constant currency in our NPS segment.
Let me move now to a little more detail on the bookings. Bookings for the quarter of $4.2 billion reflected commercial awards of $3.1 billion. And as I said, the total bookings were offset by slow federal awards of $1.1 billion. We had some very significant commercial wins in the quarter, including our applications renewal with Zurich Financial Services. And we've just recently -- in early October, we have secured a task order to provide full IT infrastructure support to the FDIC. We were awarded this in early October for $475 million, and this will go into the third quarter NPS bookings.
On a first half basis, our first half commercial awards were $6.2 billion, and this is 27% more than the $4.9 billion we reported in the first half of our fiscal year 2012. And what is particularly noteworthy is approximately 80% of these awards are either applications, business process outsourcing, consulting or industry solutions. And this is a result and very much consistent with our strategy of trying to move to higher margin offerings.
As I said, the NPS awards of $2 billion were 50% lower than the $4 billion we reported in the first half of 2012, largely a result of the uncertainty and indecisions -- or lack of decisions regarding where we are from a fiscal standpoint with the government. And our current contract backlog is $34.8 billion, and this compares to about $37.5 billion from a year ago. The MSS backlog increased by $1.1 billion. NPS decreased by $1.5 billion, and BSS decreased by a little over $2 billion, largely reflecting taking out some of the guarantee backlog associated with NHS.
My third message here was around our continuing execution of our turnaround strategy, and I am very pleased to report that we're seeing tangible improvements to profitability, particularly around our focused accounts. Several accounts are coming off that list, and we're adding some new accounts to that. But overall, the profitability is clearly better than it was a year ago. As I said, we've got some accounts coming off that list due to really intense management focus and the use of our economic game plan discipline, so that we get closer to achieving the bid models around those contracts.
There are some new accounts that we're putting on that watch list. These are accounts where we're delivering fine, we're meeting our service level agreements, but some of these accounts are not on track to meet some of our internal financial targets. So that's why we put them on the watch list. We're working the issues, establishing remediation plans, monitoring the progress. This is really now becoming a business discipline and business as usual within CSC, as we tighten up how we bid and then how we manage contracts throughout their duration.
In terms of cost takeout, on a year-to-date basis, we are running ahead of our cost takeout plans. And as you know, those cost takeout plans include improved contract management, which I just talked about; but also workforce optimizations, supply chain and demand management; and overhead reductions throughout the enterprise.
A key focus of that cost takeout work is our workforce optimization and our operating model design work, which is put in place to help streamline CSC as we begin to move from, in some places, 13 layers of management to 7 or 8 layers of management. And we've got a very disciplined process, going layer by layer to align roles and resources, and we expect most of this work will be completed by the early part of calendar year 2013. The cost takeout work also involves centralizing our key global functions such as HR, finance and marketing, all designed to get better efficiencies and drive unnecessary costs out. And frankly, because we are a little bit ahead of schedule here, this really gives us the confidence to raise our EPS targets for the balance of this fiscal year.
We continue to strengthen the leadership with experienced proven executives in a lot of our key offerings in sales and staff positions. We named Sashi Reddi to lead our big data and analytics offering. As you may know, Sashi was the founder and the CEO of AppLabs. And in our solutions business, we brought in several new leaders. Roy King now leads our consulting business. Roy's got an extensive background in consulting in Pricewaterhouse and IBM. Dave Shirk now leads our industry software and solutions organization, and he's -- has a lot of experience in Oracle, Vignette, Siemens and HP. And Peter Espinosa is our new head of sales for our solutions business. And Pete joins us from Guidewire, where he previously led sales. And we've also appointed a new head of our Americas region. This is the first time we've had someone focused on this important market for us, and Blake Saleh [ph] has joined us to take that position.
In our infrastructure business, we've added a couple of new leaders since we last spoke. Kyle Spencer [ph] leads our client program management, and Sal Como is the new head of our global delivery capability. And from our NPS business, John DeSimone has been hired to lead our mission services unit, and he will report to Dave Zolet. John was formally in public sector with IBM. All these individuals have significant experience and success in the key areas of our business. They know what it means and what it takes to scale a business and create demand, and we're really pleased that they joined us.
In some of our staff functions, we continue to reengineer those staff functions and bring in some extraordinary talent. Tom Colan is our new controller, which we're very pleased to have with us. And Charlie Adel [ph] is our new treasurer. And Brian Robins, former CFO of VeriSign, has also joined us as the vice president for BSS; and Chris Greiner [ph] is joining us and will be our new vice president of finance for our global industries. So we're really bringing a lot of talent in with fantastic credentials. And I think it's -- from my point of view, is a great sign that CSC is able to attract some of the best talent in the world, and we'll need that best talent as we continue to transform the business going forward.
We're also rationalizing and strengthening our portfolio to try to get us better positioned for our next gen infrastructure business, as well as technology solutions and services. We acquired in this period 42Six Solutions, which is a big data processing and advanced applications firm, which serves the U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Defense. And we're also reshaping our portfolio by divesting of non-core assets. And a week or so ago, we announced the divestiture of the consulting systems integration and certain product-based businesses in Italy, and we can now focus on bringing CSC's global solutions and services to multi-national companies within operations in Italy, so all, again, steps to reposition and fortify our offerings portfolio.
And as you know, after we did our Analyst Meeting in early September, we raised nearly $700 million in senior notes and received commitments for $250 million from a new bank term loan, and we have used these proceeds to refinance upcoming maturities. And our actions have resulted in a much smoother debt maturity schedule and a lower cost of debt, while improving our credit profile and liquidity position.
So before I turn this over to Paul, let me just talk a little bit about some of the uncertainty we see. Not terribly dissimilar from what we talked about in September, we certainly have the threat of sequestration and the outcome of today's election, all of this has led to significant delays in new business awards in our NPS business. We have more than $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting award. It's almost double the amount we had at the same period of time last year. So far, there have been no significant cancellations, but we have had a number of, what I'll call, contract extensions and bridges as we wait for some of this uncertainty around sequestration to lift, and approximately 20% of our bookings in the quarter were these contract bridges and extensions.
But even in this current environment, there's an opportunity for CSC as the government mandate for commercial best practices is at a level we just haven't seen before. Cloud, data centers, Cyber, Big Data are all very key things. We had some significant -- a significant win with our BizCloud offering in the government this quarter. So there are great opportunities even within this period of uncertainty.
In terms of Europe, I was in Europe all last week. I was in Germany and France and Switzerland and the U.K., and I can tell you firsthand that there's still a high degree of uncertainty in that market as well. Not only do we see some currency headwinds, but there's a lot of uncertainties, particularly within the financial sector. And I don't think these conditions are unique to CSC, but they do temper our outlook as we go forward here in the second half of the year.
But all these uncertainties notwithstanding, we are pleased with the results in the quarter and the early progress of our turnaround plans. So we're maintaining our, sort of, top line outlook here, which was flat to slightly down. And as I said, we are trending ahead of our plan on operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. And therefore, we feel it appropriate to raise our target range from the $2.10 to $2.30, to $2.30 to $2.50.
So our execution of the turnaround plan sort of continues here. We're shaping and streamlining the organizational structure, following through on the cost takeout initiatives, divesting non-core businesses and taking what we think are constructive steps to move up the value chain within our chosen markets. And overall, we are encouraged with this incremental step that we took this quarter. We have a lot to do as we go forward, and the third quarter is always a little weaker quarter sequentially than our second quarter. And we've got some issues around the NHS accounting and uncertainty, as I said, in Europe and within the federal government. But given our takeout work, we feel very confident in raising our full year EPS targets.
So now with that, I'll turn it over to Paul, and then we'll open it up for any questions that you may have. Paul?"

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program, and I will just give you some comment. I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year.On Slide 9,",2106,"Yes. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On this call, I'll comment on our quarterly results. I'll update you on our cost takeout program, and I will just give you some comment. I'll comment also on the revised targets for the year.
On Slide 9, our second quarter results were reported as revenues of approximately $3.85 billion, represent a 3% decline year-over-year, but only a 1% decline in constant currency. Our operating income in the quarter was $298 million and included a workforce restructuring charge of $58 million. Operating margins, as Mike mentioned, were 7.7% in the quarter and were sequentially ahead of our first quarter margin of 4.6%, and that reflects the benefit of our cost takeout actions. Year-to-date margins of 6.2% are running at the high end of the range which we provided for the full year. Operating margins improved by 150 basis points year-over-year after adjusting for the U.S. claims settlement charges in the prior year.
If you look at diluted EPS, our results were $0.83 per share in the quarter, which compares favorably with the prior year loss of $18.56. In the second quarter of last year, CSC's results included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.21 and a claims charge of $1.20, and those were partially offset by a tax settlement benefit of $0.72 per share. Adjusting for these items, EPS last year would have been $0.14.
Speaking of taxes, our tax rate in the quarter was 31.7% and 34.8% for the first half of the year. And for the full year, we continue to expect of an effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 36%. Free cash flow was $237 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $505 million.
Now let me turn to segment results, starting with our Public Sector business. NPS revenues were $1,038,000,000 in the quarter or approximately 35% of total company revenues. Revenues in NPS declined by 4% year-over-year but were flat on a sequential basis. Revenue from Department of Defense contracts, which accounted for 68% of NPS revenues in the quarter, were down 3% year-over-year. That is primarily due to contract and task order completions during the past year. Federal agencies accounted for 28% of NPS revenues and declined by nearly 10% year-over-year due primarily to reduced scope on existing contracts and the winding down of other contracts.
Our NPS revenue is trending in line with our expectations and we continue to expect NPS revenues to be down mid-single digits in fiscal year 2013, reflecting the continued uncertainty surrounding government budgets. NPS operating income was $150 million in the quarter, and the operating margins was 10.9%. Second quarter margins are seasonally a high point for our fiscal year. And adjusting for the claims settlement charge in the prior year, margins improved by 160 basis points.
Now NPS bookings of $1.1 billion were significantly lower than a year-ago period, reflecting delays of new government awards. CSC was awarded a number of smaller contract extensions in the quarter, which in normal time, would have been part of larger, multi-year awards and which would have contributed to much higher bookings. About 58% of our bookings came through our ID/IQ contract vehicles, which was slightly higher than the first quarter and the year-ago quarter, and year-to-date bookings were $2 billion.
Now turning now to Slide 11, our Managed Services Sector's revenue were $1.58 billion and accounted for 41% of total company revenues. MSS revenues declined by 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, but were up 1% in constant currency. We benefited from new client engagements and the AppLabs acquisitions, which contributed about $25 million of revenue in the quarter. Now this benefit helped offset contract completions and modifications.
MSS operating income was $88 million on a reported basis and $135 million when adjusted for restructuring charges. Operating profit results were driven by strong year-over-year improvement in the profitability of our focus accounts and the benefit of our cost takeout initiatives. Operating margins increased by 280 basis points over the prior year on a reported basis and 570 basis points, excluding restructuring.
Now for the remainder of the year, we expect MSS to continue to benefit from better contract management discipline, as well as cost takeout actions. And these benefits will be partially offset by investments in new contract start-ups, investment in off-shoring of service delivery and knowledge transfer to low-cost markets. Now MSS bookings were $2.2 billion in the quarter, substantially better than a year ago, primarily due to our applications contract with Zurich Financial. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were up 42%.
Now turning to Business Solutions & Services, revenue was $921 million in the quarter or 24% of total company revenues. BSS revenues decreased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, but were up 1% in constant currency. iSOFT contributed $49 million of revenue during the quarter and represented a year-over-year increase of a $17 million. BSS operating income was $64 million before restructuring, benefiting in part from our cost takeout actions. Operating margin improved to 6.9% in the quarter from 3.6% 1 year ago and 1.6% in the first quarter of this year. Our BSS bookings were $900 million, in line with the year-ago period. And virtually all of these contracts came from new customers or new scope of work. And on a year-to-date basis, our BSS bookings were unchanged.
During the quarter, we signed an interim agreement with NHS, which established a framework for selling [ph] our standardized Lorenzo software modules to all trusts in England. In conjunction with the interim agreement, CSC received a payment of $110 million. Now this payment is being amortized over the term of the new agreement. And as a result, the impact on our P&L for this quarter was minimal.
Now the company has determined that the new NHS agreement should be accounted for under service accounting, which we firmly believe is the most appropriate and the more conservative accounting approach than alternative methods. Now under service accounting, future Lorenzo deployments will impact the P&L when the software is deployed. Now at that time, the revenue and profit will be amortized over the hosting period of the contract, which is expected to be 5 years.
Now given the history of the NHS program and the complexity of this agreement, we've submitted a pre-clearance letter to the SEC, and they are in their final stages of review. Now since we're on this topic, let me update you on the SEC investigation. The SEC is continuing its investigation regarding their concern over prior NHS accounting and related disclosures. Now the company, the audit committee and its independent council are investigating these matters and are continuing to cooperate with this investigation. And we will keep you updated on this matter.
Now let me turn to Slide 13 and talk about our cash flow performance in the quarter. As you can see, free cash flow was $237 million for the quarter compared with an outflow of $268 million in the prior year. Now this represents a $505 million year-over-year improvement in cash flow. Now this turnaround can be attributed to improved operating profitability, better working capital management and the benefit of the $110 million payment received from NHS.
Capital expenditures declined by $55 million year-over-year, reflecting our new capital allocation discipline. On a year-to-date basis, CapEx was $365 million, a decline of 30% from the prior year. And year-to-date CapEx and capital lease payments were 6.2% of revenue as compared to 8% for the prior year.
On Slide 15 (sic) [Slide 14], we highlight a few balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.85 billion, which includes $700 million from our refinancing activities in September. Accounts receivables, excluding tax receivables, were $3 billion. DSOs, days sales outstanding, were 72 days, an improvement of 14 days year-over-year. And the DSOs, excluding unbilled receivables, were approximately 41 days, in line with our first quarter results, but 7 days better than the prior year. Also shown on this slide is our revised maturity schedule, which was updated to reflect the redemption of our maturing debt, which took place in October.
As previously announced, CSC raised $350 million of 3-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $350 million of 10-year notes at 4.45%, and those are shown on the purple bars on the graph. Subsequent to the quarter, we raised $250 [ph] million from a new 4-year bank term loan, which had a floating-rate interest of LIBOR plus 187 basis points or 2.2% currently. Now this is part of our strategy of diversifying our funding sources. Now we used the proceeds of these offerings to redeem early the $1 billion of debt coming due in 2013. By taking these actions, we're smoothing out our debt maturities, lowering our cost of debt and strengthening our credit profile while maintaining ample access to liquidity. The P&L impact of redeeming the maturing notes early will result in a $19 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter, which will be partially offset by lower average interest expenses for the remainder of the year. Our refinancing actions will lower interest expense by approximately $20 million on an annual basis.
Now let me update you on our cost takeout program. We've outlined a plan to take $1 billion to $1.2 billion of costs out of our cost structures by 2014, with $500 million to $600 million coming in the current fiscal year. Now we expect the savings to come from 4 areas, which are shown on the slide. First, in supply chain and procurement, we're implementing category sourcing plans for key procurement activities. We're consolidating our purchases with fewer vendors, and we're instituting a demand management program across the company to ensure compliance with our preferred vendors.
Now you should know that we recently entered into a strategic sourcing arrangement with 2 partners to purchase their products and solution under a utility or consumption-based model. Now these types of agreements are aligned with our stated objective of reducing the capital intensity of our business.
Second, we're making progress on our workforce optimization. We've completed the restructuring plan, which were initiated late last year for the U.K., Germany and the Nordics. And we're going through a process now of eliminating layers of management as we roll out our new operating model. We're about halfway through this process. As discussed at our Investor Day meeting, our aim is to reduce managerial layers from 13 to 8 and expand managerial span of control to an average of 8 direct reports.
A third area of opportunity for cost takeout is reducing enterprise overheads. We're streamlining our corporate and business unit functions, we're zero-basing activities at corporate and across business sectors and geographies and we are going to be benchmarking our cost against best-in-class companies.
And fourth, we continue to make significant progress in contract management. Mike alluded to that in his remarks. We have a tighter bid review process, and we're tracking results against bid models and time lines. And for the first half of the year, the profitability of our focus accounts has improved by approximately $110 million, so we're well on our way to our goal of $100 million to $200 million for uptake cost -- of cost improvement -- or profitability improvement for fiscal year 2013.
Now halfway through our fiscal year, we've realized approximately $280 million of the $500 million to $600 million in cost takeout. So we're making good progress, and we're trending toward the high end of our target. These savings are helping us fund reinvestments, which include customer-committed savings, enterprise tools and systems, sales and go-to-market initiatives and workforce restructuring, as well as the investment associated with knowledge transfers to low-cost markets. Now we expect our reinvestments to be at the high end of our $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal year 2013.
So based on our first half results, our operating performance is steadily improving, and we're making good progress on our cost takeout initiatives. As a result, we are raising our target earnings per share to $2.30 to $2.50 for fiscal year 2013, up from a prior range of $2.10 to $2.30. As Mike mentioned, we expect Q3 to be impacted sequentially by seasonal trends, NHS accounting and the timing of some of our reinvestments. We're still assuming an effective tax rate of 32% to 36% for the year. And our target now for free cash flow is $400 million to $450 million, an increase from our previous range of $300 million to $350 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

Are we going to move into more of that $1 billion to $1.2 billion this year? Secondly, I know during the Investor Day, Mike, you had mentioned reinvesting, I think, it was around 75% of that 25% passing through. I know you again mentioned you'd see around $200 million to $250 million reinvested, but how much actually was reinvested in this quarter because based on the margin expansion, it looks like a lot of it passed through to the bottom line?"

I mean, the biggest expense we had, reinvestment, if you will, in the second quarter was the restructuring charge of $58 million, if I remember correctly. So that was the biggest single investment, and that's obviously helping us then achieve an operating expense run rate lower than we had in the first quarter. I still think we're -- as Paul said, we're sort of at the high range here of the cost takeout for the full year, so I don't want to declare anything more than that. We are slightly ahead, but a lot of that is a result of some actions we took at the end of last fiscal year around the restructuring, particularly at the U.K. and Germany and the Nordics. And those teams did a great job executing that part, and we're seeing the benefits in our run rate now. I would also say we've made some good early gains in procurement as we've centralized procurement and got some standardized contracts in place and some standardized buying around the world. So you get sort of an initial blip in terms of cost reduction when you put that in place, and then that begins to moderate as you move forward and get to a more of a steady-state run rate. So I think Paul's called it right here. I think we're at the high end here of the cost takeout this fiscal year, and we're at the high end of the reinvestment. Most of that reinvestment has come around restructuring charges to date. We will be making some reinvestment, particularly in our systems, our financial systems. We are going to begin to invest in some go-to-market or demand generation activities, particularly sales people, as we see that demand pick up in areas like cloud and Cyber, for example, and even some geographic areas. So I think we've got this called pretty much the way we see it right now."

There's a lot of -- I won't call it hype, but a lot of discussion around cloud. And what Paul and I want to get comfortable with is the economic model that supports cloud. Because the hypothesis here is that as we begin to deliver infrastructure services more as a service or from the cloud, we want to make sure there is an existence theorem that says we will get higher margins, higher contribution than we do from our existing infrastructure business. And we boil this down to 2 fundamental things: One is the capacity of the compute and storage facility in the cloud, and we understand that now. We understand where we break even. It is a geometric progression as you begin to get more capacity utilized. And then the second thing is the labor to support that compute capacity. It's very important that, that labor cost come from lower-cost areas around the world. And if you manage those 2 variables well, then there is an opportunity to have significant higher contribution to profit from the revenue associated with that. So where we are now is we are much more now in the mode of demand generation. So we're comfortable with the economic model. We've got a lot of this infrastructure in place. And now, it comes time to begin to sell. Gartner just put us in the leaders' quadrant for our cloud infrastructure offerings, so we're really going to begin to try to push the accelerator here on the demand generation side."

This is just good old-fashioned business 101 discipline, and that gives you a real bump. Now in order to make that sustainable, you then need to make systemic changes, and that revolves around our bid models. We've just rolled out a whole new delegation of authority throughout the business, so we understand at what levels of the business we're going to take what risks, and those are all more systemic changes to the model that will allow us a more consistent disciplined approach to contract management as we go forward. In terms of conversations with our clients, they range the gamut. Sometimes, we amend the contract for a little less revenue, but more profitability. Other times, we get an agreement to expand the scope or, in some cases, as we've gone through these contracts, we've found that we haven't billed all of the scope changes that we should have billed. So then we go to the customer and say, ""Gee, we haven't billed these. We're going to bill them now."" So those conversations run the gamut of the different levers that we have to improve profitability. But it's not just about improving profitability, it's about improving value, the value that we deliver to the client. So this isn't about, ""Let me just go figure out how to make more money,"" this is about how do we add more value to our clients and in the process be more profitable. So that's the genesis of the discussion with the clients is what can we do to help them. And in helping our clients, we drive more profitability for our shareholders at the same time.

And as a result of that, I think we'll benefit from the lower interest expense in the fourth quarter. It'll be benefiting to us in the second quarter. But net-net, you'll see interest expense up sequentially, then back down. And we'll..."

So those 2 things give us a little more certainty and a little more clear visibility as we go forward."

So perhaps to simplify things, can you guys just maybe help us understand some of the specifics that will impact margins in the second half of the year, perhaps that we didn't see in the first half? I think you just mentioned the $19 million for refinancing and there were several other items noted, but perhaps you could just review those quickly, so we have an idea of what some of the items that are going to happen in the second half of the year that we didn't see in the margin structure in the first half?"

So we said that our cost takeout is progressing well at the high end of the range. And so I would suspect that we'll have just a slight benefit from that in the second half of the year on a net basis. We will do better on our cost takeout net of the reinvestments that we are making. Some of the headwinds that we would have is there's some seasonality in our MSS business in the third quarter, then it kind of comes back in the fourth quarter. The other thing is our NHS new accounting. As I mentioned to you, this is going to be now accounted under service accounting. And as a result of that, if I were to look at the entire contribution from NHS in the first quarter, this is Lorenzo and non-Lorenzo part, that would be a -- we were slightly positive in the first half of the year. If we include again all of the business that we do with the NHS, in the second half of the year we will be operating closer to breakeven. And so when you net all of these things out, you get back to what we gave you as a guidance, which is, sequentially, third quarter would be a little weaker than it was in the second quarter, and then it will pick up again in the fourth quarter. And for the total year, we will be at the $2.30 to $2.50 range in EPS."

So, one, I want to see our continued execution; and, two, I'm -- like any business leader right now, I'm trying to understand what's going to happen here, particularly in the U.S. with our federal business, that's very important and then the continued commercial business in Europe.

I mentioned Blake [ph], I mentioned Pete Espinosa, but we've got some others. These are proven sales leaders. They understand how to drive technology solutions into the marketplace. So we're trying to move from we respond to RFPs to we actually create demand for our offerings in the marketplace. So that's one, is that it starts with -- always starts with people and it starts with sales leaders. We are beginning to ramp up some of our sales people in cloud, for example. So I talked about the fact that Paul and I are reasonably comfortable with the economic model now under cloud. So we're beginning to go out and recruit people into our cloud offerings, likewise with Cyber, where we're seeing some success in demand and also with Big Data. The other area is cross-sell. I think I mentioned, when we were together in September, of all of our global 1,000 accounts, we only cross-sell into about 12% of those. So we're changing how we approach that because if you have a happy client that you're delivering value to, it's an easier place to go sell additional services and capability to. Zurich Financial Services would be an example of that. And then there's certain theaters, geographic regions that we see growth. We see good growth right now in the commercial sector in the United States. We see growth opportunities in parts of Asia. So we're going to target these investments in sales, in particular, in those areas where we see and are very comfortable with the trend line, and we have factored that into the projections that we have communicated today."
