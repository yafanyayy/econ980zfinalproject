With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions.We are p",474,"Thank you for joining us this evening, where we will report our third quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions.
We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue grew 7.9% from last year's third quarter to revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million, and earnings per share were $0.58, a 41.5% increase over last year.
I would like to make a few comments on this quarter's revenue growth. This year's third quarter had one more work day than last year's third quarter, which benefits our overall revenue growth. On a same work day basis, our revenue growth was 6.3% over last year's third quarter. 
Our organic growth, which accounts for both work day adjustments and the impact of acquisitions, was 5.9%. Keep in mind that the recycled paper prices remained at approximately $150 per ton throughout the quarter, and this lower price negatively impacted our consolidated revenue growth over last year's third quarter by 6/10 of 1%.
Our operating margin continues to reflect our focus on high quality growth. The operating margin of 13.6% was an improvement over both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from lower than expected energy-related costs and medical costs. Energy-related costs for the third quarter were 3.3% of revenue, which is slightly better than expected level of 3.5% assumed in our guidance. In addition, medical-related expenses were 30 basis points lower than last year due to better than expected experience.
As a result of the better-than-expected results in the third quarter, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.24 to $2.27.  This guidance assumes no deterioration in the current U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, and recycled paper prices to continue to be approximately $150 per ton. It also assumes that energy-related costs will increase to approximately 3.5% of revenue and medical expenses to increase to normalized levels.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the third quarter last year, with total company organic growth being 5.9%. 
Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.1%, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.8% despite a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, please let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter, which is one more than last year, and there are 66 work days in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is 1 less than fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the phase of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other restroom products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter Rental revenue was $721 million, which is up 8.4% compared to last year's third quarter, and up 6.5% organically over last year. All areas of our Rental business grew in the third quarter, and we continue to focus on selling profitable business.
Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.8%, primarily due to lower energy-related costs. The impact of cotton continued to be at the expected level.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to Rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Third quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The increase is mainly due to better capacity utilization from the higher volume, slightly offset by the expected cotton impact.  The gross margin of 30.5% was an improvement over the second quarter gross margin of 29.6%, mainly due to a better mix of higher margin products.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenues in the third quarter.  Revenues were $101.4 million, an increase of 11.2% versus last year's third quarter, and organic growth was 9.1%. We continue to see good revenue performance out of this segment, as both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection grew nicely for the quarter.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the third quarter compared to 41.5% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related expenses were 10 basis points lower this year compared to last year. However, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes was the driver of the gross margin expansion. The third quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was roughly consistent with the second quarter gross margin of 43.1%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 2% over last year's third quarter. Revenue decreased organically though by 1.3% compared to last year. As we mentioned in the press release, our third quarter Document Management revenue growth was adversely affected by lower recycled paper prices. The recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter, which is the same level we saw at the end of our second fiscal quarter. This results in a paper price that is roughly 30% lower than last year's third quarter and closed to 50% less than the first quarter of this fiscal year.  While it is difficult to predict this price for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, as Bill mentioned, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The document management gross margin is also adversely affected by the drop in recycled paper prices, as the change in the prices generally drops to the bottom line. The third quarter gross margin was 47% compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 49.4%. The negative impact of lower recycled paper prices was somewhat offset by better capacity utilization from higher service volumes.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses, we are pleased with our continued leveraging of the consolidated selling and administrative expenses. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses were 28.5% of revenue, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter of 30.2%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. And administrative expenses continued to be lower as a percent of revenue due to lower medical expenses and administrative labor.
Third quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.5% of revenue were also lower than the 29.2% in this year's second quarter. Although payroll taxes increased due to resetting at the beginning of the calendar year, decreases in medical expenses and workers comp related expenses and continued cost control initiatives more than offset that increase.
Our effective tax rate was 37% for the quarter compared to 38.9% last year. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $353 million at February 29, up $15 million from the $338 million at November 30. Please note that about $170 million of this cash and marketable securities is located outside of the U.S.
Accounts receivable decreased by $8 million since November 30. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 29 was $276 million, down $12 million from November 30. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized.
Accrued liabilities decreased $95 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the December payments of the annual dividend and accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at February 29 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. We intend to pay this off -- pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount.  The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1% and total debt-to-EBITDA is roughly 2x.
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $131.8 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $98.7 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory doing this year's third quarter added to the improvement over last year.
CapEx for the third quarter was $37.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $26.8 million in Rental; $1.9 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $5.8 million in Document Management.  We expect CapEx for the fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

We are a -- we tend to be a bit conservative, but I also think a few things deserve mention that Mike brought up in his comments. We did see our medical expenses being lower in the third quarter than what this typical, so we expect those to rise to more normalized levels and thus impact SG&A. We do expect energy cost to be back up 20 to 30 basis points from what we saw in third quarter. We still have some concerns about the economy in terms of job growth and just overall confidence. The paper price has a big impact on us, and we continue to expect that to be low. And keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter, we were seeing rising paper prices from the third quarter of last year, and therefore, if the paper prices do not increase, which we don't really expect them to do at this point, the impact of the lower paper prices this year is going to have a bigger impact than what Mike talked about for the third quarter. And then, finally, I think another thing to, that's worth some mention here is that we have seen a pickup of our turn over in our sales force to more normalized levels over the last few months. And as we replace these more productive salespeople with newer salespeople, we tend to think that the impact on new business might be impacted a bit. So that's why the guidance was as we provided it."

So we're able to streamline a number of our processes.

So there's not a lot of additional capacity for new stops. There's capacity for additional business on existing stops, especially in the Rental division when you have additional wearers at the stop, the effort to take the uniforms and for the new wearer is really not that significant over what you were doing anywhere. So you get some nice revenue growth there. But generally speaking, the impact of new business does require us to continue to expand the routes. On the production side, I think we've been saying this for some time, and we continue to feel pretty confident that we have adequate production capacity in most areas of the country. Therefore, we will not need to invest in a lot more plant capacity as our revenues continue to increase. And then on the other businesses, the Document Management business is primarily route-based. We have a little bit of Storage business, and of course, the Storage revenue continues to increase. You got to make sure you have capacity and racking to put those boxes in storage. But since most of the bulk of our business is shredding, that's a route-based business, and again it depends on is it additional stops or is it just additional volume within the stop that determines what kind of capacity you need to have."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions.
We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue grew 7.9% from last year's third quarter to revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million, and earnings per share were $0.58, a 41.5% increase over last year.
I would like to make a few comments on this quarter's revenue growth. This year's third quarter had one more work day than last year's third quarter, which benefits our overall revenue growth. On a same-workday basis, our revenue growth was 6.3% over last year's third quarter. 
Our organic growth, which accounts for both workday adjustments and the impact of acquisitions, was 5.9%. Keep in mind that the recycled paper prices remained at approximately $150 per ton throughout the quarter, and this lower price negatively impacted our consolidated revenue growth over last year's third quarter by 0.6%.
Our operating margin continues to reflect our focus on high quality growth. The operating margin of 13.6% was an improvement over both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from lower-than-expected energy-related costs and medical costs. Energy-related costs for the third quarter were 3.3% of revenue, which is slightly better than the expected level of 3.5% assumed in our guidance. In addition, medical-related expenses were 30 basis points lower than last year due to better than expected experience.
As a result of the better-than-expected results in the third quarter, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.24 to $2.27.  This guidance assumes no deterioration in the current U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, and recycled paper prices to continue to be approximately $150 per ton. It also assumes that energy-related costs will increase to approximately 3.5% of revenue and medical expenses to increase to normalized levels.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the third quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 5.9%. 
Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.1%, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.8% despite a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, please let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter, which is one more than last year; and there are 66 work days in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter Rental revenue was $721 million, which is up 8.4% compared to last year's third quarter and up 6.5% organically over last year. All areas of our Rental business grew in the third quarter, and we continue to focus on selling profitable business.
Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.8%, primarily due to lower energy-related costs. The impact of cotton continued to be at the expected level.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to Rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter.  Third quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The increase is mainly due to better capacity utilization from the higher volume, slightly offset by the expected cotton impact.  The gross margin of 30.5% was an improvement over the second quarter gross margin of 29.6%, mainly due to a better mix of higher margin products.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenues in the third quarter.  Revenues were $101.4 million, an increase of 11.2% versus last year's third quarter, and organic growth was 9.1%. We continue to see good revenue performance out of this segment, as both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection grew nicely for the quarter.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the third quarter compared to 41.5% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related expenses were 10 basis points lower this year compared to last year. However, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes was the driver of the gross margin expansion. The third quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was roughly consistent with the second quarter gross margin of 43.1%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 2% over last year's third quarter. Revenue decreased organically though by 1.3% compared to last year. As we mentioned in the press release, our third quarter Document Management revenue growth was adversely affected by lower recycled paper prices. The recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter, which is the same level we saw at the end of our second fiscal quarter. This results in a paper price that is roughly 30% lower than last year's third quarter and close to 50% less than the first quarter of this fiscal year. While it is difficult to predict this price for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, as Bill mentioned, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The document management gross margin is also adversely affected by the drop in recycled paper prices as the change in the prices generally drops to the bottom line. The third quarter gross margin was 47% compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 49.4%. The negative impact of lower recycled paper prices was somewhat offset by better capacity utilization from higher service volumes.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses, we are pleased with our continued leveraging of the consolidated selling and administrative expenses. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses were 28.5% of revenue, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter of 30.2%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. And administrative expenses continued to be lower as a percent of revenue due to lower medical expenses and administrative labor.
Third quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.5% of revenue were also lower than the 29.2% in this year's second quarter. Although payroll taxes increased due to resetting at the beginning of the calendar year, decreases in medical expenses and workers comp related expenses and continued cost control initiatives more than offset that increase.
Our effective tax rate was 37% for the quarter compared to 38.9% last year. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $353 million at February 29, up $15 million from the $338 million at November 30. Please note that about $170 million of this cash and marketable securities is located outside of the U.S.
Accounts receivable decreased by $8 million since November 30. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 29 was $276 million, down $12 million from November 30. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized.
Accrued liabilities decreased $95 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the December payments of the annual dividend and accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at February 29 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay this off -- pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount.  The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1% and total debt-to-EBITDA is roughly 2x.
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $131.8 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $98.7 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory doing this year's third quarter added to the improvement over last year.
CapEx for the third quarter was $37.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $26.8 million in Rental; $1.9 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $5.8 million in Document Management.  We expect CapEx for the fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

We are a -- we tend to be a bit conservative, but I also think a few things deserve mention that Mike brought up in his comments. We did see our medical expenses be lower in the third quarter than what is typical, so we expect those to rise to more normalized levels and thus impact SG&A. We do expect energy cost to be back up about 20 to 30 basis points from what we saw in the third quarter. We still have some concerns about the economy in terms of job growth and just overall confidence. The paper price has a big impact on us, and we continue to expect that to be low. And keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter, we were seeing rising paper prices from the third quarter of last year. And therefore, if the paper prices do not increase, which we don't really expect them to do at this point, the impact of the lower paper prices this year is going to have a bigger impact than what Mike talked about for the third quarter. And then, finally, I think another thing to -- that's worth some mention here is that we have seen a pickup of our turnover in our sales force to more normalized levels over the last few months. And as we replace these more productive salespeople with newer salespeople, we tend to think that the impact on new business might be impacted a bit. So that's why the guidance was as we provided it."

And the fact that a significant number of our Rental routes and some of our other services routes have gone to 4-day workweeks instead of 5, and that's improved our fuel efficiency, as well as the productivity of our workforce. The G&A area has certainly been benefited by our CEO's initiative of looking -- making sure that everything we do is of value to our customers, and that they recognize it, and they're willing to pay for it. So we've been able to streamline a number of our processes.

So there's not a lot of additional capacity for new stops. There's capacity for additional business on existing stops, especially in the Rental division when you have additional wearers at the stop, the effort to take the uniforms and for the new wearer are really not that significant over what you were doing anyway. So we get some nice revenue growth there. But generally speaking, the impact of new business does require us to continue to expand the routes. On the production side, I think we've been saying this for some time, and we continue to feel pretty confident that we have adequate production capacity in most areas of the country. Therefore, we will not need to invest in a lot more plant capacity as our revenues continue to increase. And then on the other businesses, the Document Management business is primarily route-based. We have a little bit of Storage business. And of course, the Storage revenue continues to increase. You've got to make sure you have capacity and racking to put those boxes in storage. But since most of our -- the bulk of our business is shredding, that's a route-based business, and again it depends on is it additional stops or is it just additional volume within the stop that determines what kind of capacity you need to have."

And a lot of the revenue that we're adding like Hygiene Services, Chemical business, Tile and Carpet Cleaning does not require any laundry facility capacity. And so we still think that we can get leverage going forward from a gross margin standpoint. Now there may be ups and downs because of material costs ups and downs, maybe due to cotton, but we still think there is some leverage opportunity in our gross margin and in our production facilities. And if you think about the fact that we still haven't seen a significant amount of customer hiring, if our customers start to hire and we get a lot of adds at existing stops, we're going to see even better margin impact there. So keep in mind a lot of that hire -- some of the highest margin revenue left us during the recession and has yet to come back. So we still have some gross margin opportunity. In the SG&A, if you think about some of the cost that maybe we didn't have in the earlier part of the 2000s, which were stock option expensing, medical wasn't as high, there may be some reasons for not getting all the way back to the SG&A levels that we saw, but still some leverage over the next couple of years."

So the authorization, we've always completed our authorizations over time, and I would say that the board will direct us on what they think is in the best long-term interest of our shareholder."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions.
We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue grew 7.9% from last year's third quarter to revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million, and earnings per share were $0.58, a 41.5% increase over last year.
I would like to make a few comments on this quarter's revenue growth. This year's third quarter had one more work day than last year's third quarter, which benefits our overall revenue growth. On a same-workday basis, our revenue growth was 6.3% over last year's third quarter. 
Our organic growth, which accounts for both workday adjustments and the impact of acquisitions, was 5.9%. Keep in mind that the recycled paper prices remained at approximately $150 per ton throughout the quarter, and this lower price negatively impacted our consolidated revenue growth over last year's third quarter by 0.6%.
Our operating margin continues to reflect our focus on high quality growth. The operating margin of 13.6% was an improvement over both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from lower-than-expected energy-related costs and medical costs. Energy-related costs for the third quarter were 3.3% of revenue, which is slightly better than the expected level of 3.5% assumed in our guidance. In addition, medical-related expenses were 30 basis points lower than last year due to better than expected experience.
As a result of the better-than-expected results in the third quarter, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.24 to $2.27. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the current U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, and recycled paper prices to continue to be approximately $150 per ton. It also assumes that energy-related costs will increase to approximately 3.5% of revenue and medical expenses to increase to normalized levels.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the third quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 5.9%. 
Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.1%, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.8% despite a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.
Before doing so, please let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter, which is one more than last year; and there are 66 work days in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012.
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter rental revenue was $721 million, which is up 8.4% compared to last year's third quarter and up 6.5% organically over last year. All areas of our rental business grew in the third quarter, and we continue to focus on selling profitable business.
Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.8%, primarily due to lower energy-related costs. The impact of cotton continued to be at the expected level.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The increase is mainly due to better capacity utilization from the higher volume, slightly offset by the expected cotton impact. The gross margin of 30.5% was an improvement over the second quarter gross margin of 29.6%, mainly due to a better mix of higher margin products.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenues were $101.4 million, an increase of 11.2% versus last year's third quarter and organic growth was 9.1%. We continue to see good revenue performance out of this segment, as both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection grew nicely for the quarter.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the third quarter compared to 41.5% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related expenses were 10 basis points lower this year compared to last year. However, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes was the driver of the gross margin expansion. The third quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was roughly consistent with the second quarter gross margin of 43.1%.
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 2% over last year's third quarter. Revenue decreased organically, though, by 1.3% compared to last year. As we mentioned in the press release, our third quarter Document Management revenue growth was adversely affected by lower recycled paper prices. The recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter, which is the same level we saw at the end of our second fiscal quarter. This results in a paper price that is roughly 30% lower than last year's third quarter and close to 50% less than the first quarter of this fiscal year. While it is difficult to predict this price for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, as Bill mentioned, our updated guidance assumes the prices will stay at $150 per ton.
The Document Management gross margin is also adversely affected by the drop in recycled paper prices as the change in the prices generally drops to the bottom line. The third quarter gross margin was 47% compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 49.4%. The negative impact of lower recycled paper prices was somewhat offset by better capacity utilization from higher service volumes.
Moving to selling and administrative expenses, we are pleased with our continued leveraging of the consolidated selling and administrative expenses. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses were 28.5% of revenue, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter of 30.2%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. And administrative expenses continued to be lower as a percent of revenue due to lower medical expenses and administrative labor.
Third quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.5% of revenue were also lower than the 29.2% in this year's second quarter. Although payroll taxes increased due to resetting at the beginning of the calendar year, decreases in medical expenses and workers’ comp related expenses and continued cost control initiatives more than offset that increase.
Our effective tax rate was 37% for the quarter compared to 38.9% last year. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $353 million at February 29, up $15 million from the $338 million at November 30. Please note that about $170 million of this cash and marketable securities is located outside of the U.S.
Accounts receivable decreased by $8 million since November 30. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at November 30. 
New goods inventory at February 29 was $276 million, down $12 million from November 30. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized.
Accrued liabilities decreased $95 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the December payments of the annual dividend and accrued bond interest.
Long-term debt at February 29 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay this off -- pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1% and total debt-to-EBITDA is roughly 2x.
Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $131.8 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $98.7 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's third quarter added to the improvement over last year.
CapEx for the third quarter was $37.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $26.8 million in rental; $1.9 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $5.8 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

We did see our medical expenses be lower in the third quarter than what is typical, so we expect those to rise to more normalized levels and thus impact SG&A. We do expect energy costs to be back up about 20 to 30 basis points from what we saw in the third quarter. We still have some concerns about the economy in terms of job growth and just overall confidence. The paper price has a big impact on us, and we continue to expect that to be low. And keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter, we were seeing rising paper prices from the third quarter of last year. And therefore, if the paper prices do not increase, which we don't really expect them to do at this point, the impact of the lower paper prices this year is going to have a bigger impact than what Mike talked about for the third quarter. And then, finally, I think another thing to -- that's worth some mention here is that we have seen a pickup of our turnover in our sales force to more normalized levels over the last few months. And as we replace these more productive salespeople with newer salespeople, we tend to think that the impact on new business might be impacted a bit. So that's why the guidance was as we provided it."

So there's not a lot of additional capacity for new stops. There's capacity for additional business on existing stops, especially in the rental division when you have additional wearers at a stop, the effort to take the uniforms in for the new wearer are really not that significant over what you were doing anyway. So we -- you get some nice revenue growth there. But generally speaking, the impact of new business does require us to continue to expand the routes. On the production side, I think we've been saying this for some time, and we continue to feel pretty confident that we have adequate production capacity in most areas of the country. Therefore, we will not need to invest in a lot more plant capacity as our revenues continue to increase. And then on the other businesses, the Document Management business is primarily route-based. We have a little bit of storage business. And of course, the storage revenue continues to increase. You got to make sure you have capacity and racking to put those boxes in storage.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results and our fiscal 2013 guidance, we will be happy to answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $1,054,000,000. In an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, fourth quarter revenue grew 4.1% from last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 11.1% to $79 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 22.4% increase over last year. Mike will provide more details shortly on the fourth quarter performance. 
This fourth quarter concluded a very successful fiscal 2012 year for Cintas, in which our revenue topped the $4 billion mark for the first time at $4,102,000,000, and our earnings per diluted share hit a record level of $2.27. Our employees, who we call partners, did a great job of executing our game plan throughout these past 12 months. Congratulations to our partners on their achievements this year. We remain confident in our business' opportunities and our ability to execute our game plan. As such, during our fourth quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares of Cintas stock at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million. Since these purchases were made so late in the fiscal year, they had no impact on our fourth quarter results. However, we expect it will positively increase fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. This impact is incorporated into our fiscal 2013 guidance. 
Our board authorized a $500 million share buyback program in October 2011, so we now have $370.4 million remaining of that authorization. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."
260725,213708552,325994,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2012",2012-07-16,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 4%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 4%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.8%, mainly due to lower recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there are 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which was the same as last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter; 65 in the second quarter; 64 workdays in the third quarter; and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is 1 less than fiscal 2012. The difference occurs in the third quarter, where there were 65 workdays in fiscal 2012. The 1 less workday in fiscal 2013 will negatively impact fiscal 2013 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%; and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%. 
Fourth quarter rental revenue was $749 million, which is up 5.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.2%. Growth continued to come in the form of new business, as sales rep productivity continued to be good. However, just as we have seen worsening trends in U.S. employment and in the general U.S. economy, our net add starts trending worsened throughout the quarter. This worsening trend contributed to a slowing of the revenue growth rate from 6.5% organic growth in our third quarter. 
Our rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the fourth quarter, a 30-basis-point decrease from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. This benefit though was offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business during the year, as well as the expected higher cotton impact. The worsening trend of net add stops results in a greater percentage of revenue coming from new business, which requires injection of new inventory. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $111.2 million represents an increase of 2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.7% for the fourth quarter, which is down slightly from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. The gross margin of 30.7% was a slight improvement over the third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $108.9 million, an increase of 9.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9%. This segment had a very good fiscal year, growing 10.1% and topping $400 million for the full fiscal year. This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 41.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points lower this year compared to last year. In addition, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.2% compared to last year. Our Document Management fourth quarter performance was adversely affected by 3 things. First, the recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter. This resulted in a decrease of over 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This lower price negatively impacted revenue for the quarter by $7.4 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Bill will discuss our fiscal 2013 recycled paper price assumptions in his guidance discussion. 
The second item to negatively affect performance was continuing difficulty in Europe. We have made operational and efficiency improvements in our businesses during this fiscal year, but revenue growth in the current environment is a challenge. And the third item to negatively affect fourth quarter results is the performance of our imaging business. Imaging business is largely a project business and last year's fourth quarter benefited from several large onetime projects that did not reoccur this year. Despite the challenges of lower recycled paper prices, we continued to be pleased with the North American document shredding side of the business. We continue to move forward with our game plan of managing the business for the long-term benefit of our customers, selling profitable business and creating efficiencies from off-site shredding opportunities and from process improvements. Since the impact of lower recycled paper prices fall directly to the bottom line, Document Management gross margin dropped to 46.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 51.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. This is an improvement from last year's fourth quarter of 30.1%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to managing our cost structure while continuing to grow revenue. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.8% of revenue were higher than the 28.5% in this year's third quarter, due to a 50-basis-point increase in the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 39.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 36.8%, which is slightly lower than our expected rate of 37% due to the resolution of federal audits of our fiscal 2009 and 2010 years. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balance was $340 million at May 31, down $13 million from the $353 million in cash and marketable securities at February 29, primarily due to the share buyback of $130 million during the fourth quarter. Included in the $340 million at May 31 was $52 million of cash located outside of the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of a onetime opportunity to bring $110 million back into the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $11 million since February 29. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as of February 29. New goods inventory at May 31 was $251 million, down $25 million from February 29. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 29, primarily due to higher accrued bond interest and higher accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We repaid $225 million of 6% 10-year debt that matured on June 1, 2012, and we issued new tenure debt on June 5 with a coupon of 3.25%. We issued a new debt due to the attractiveness of the interest rate levels. As of May 31, our total debt to EBITDA is slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided the operating activities in the fourth quarter was $162 million, which is up from last year's fourth quarter amount of $133 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's fourth quarter added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $43.1 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.2 million in rental; $1.6 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $2.7 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection; and $7.6 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."

Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance",467,"Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. This guidance certainly considers the current economic climate, which is not healthy. We have had 3 consecutive months of poor job creation. In fact, only 225,000 jobs were created in that time, about 1/2 of which were professional and administrative positions. The Institute for Supply Management indicated in June that exports fell and new factory orders dropped at the fastest pace since 2001. We've seen numerous U.S. GDP forecasts that show growth of less than 2% during the next 18 months. As Mike mentioned, our net adds stops trending worsened during our fourth quarter, a reflection of our customers' concern and uncertainty at this time. Clearly, there is little momentum in the economy. 
Despite this lack of momentum though, we remain encouraged by our business' performance and continue to expect our revenue to grow organically in the mid-single digits in this type of environment. As we have discussed on the last few calls, recycled paper prices have been quite a headwind during the last 2 quarters. We expect it to remain this way for the next 2 quarters. We have assumed that recycled paper prices increase about $10 per ton each quarter in fiscal 2013 from the $150 a ton level at May 31. Last year's first quarter average price was roughly $275 per ton and the second quarter average price was roughly $225 per ton. Keep in mind that this pricing difference impacts both revenue and fall directly to operating income. Our energy-related expenses for fiscal 2012 were roughly 3.3% of sales. Our guidance assumes that fiscal 2013 energy-related expenses remain at this level. We recently issued $250 million of tenured debt with a 3.25% coupon that essentially replaced the $225 million of debt that matured on June 1. Including all fees and the impacts of interest rate locks, this new debt will reduce overall interest expense by about $3.5 million. However, much of this benefit will be offset by a higher effective tax rate. 
We expect our fiscal 2013 effective rate to be 37.3%, which is higher than the 36.8% in fiscal 2012. As Mike discussed, the fiscal 2012 effective rate benefited from the resolution of audits. And finally, keep in mind that the guidance incorporates the share buybacks from our fourth quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, this will benefit fiscal 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.06. Hopefully, this additional color adds perspective to our guidance. With that, we will now be glad to take any of your questions."

To date, we have not determined that it was beneficial for us to do so, but we'll continue to evaluate it. It is not a very robust hedging market, and as a result of that, you're really taking more of a gamble than really hedging anything based on what we're seeing so far.

So we're not going to take necessarily a lower return on one unit versus another. As far as synergies, it so much depends, John, on the nature of where the customers are coming from, the size of the customers. If we have a deal whereby we have capacity in existing facilities in a region and we buy a local competitor that perhaps serves multiple cities, we can get a lot of synergies because we can deploy that new volume pretty easily in multiple facilities. The more concentrated the volume is that we get, the more likely it will take a little longer to get those synergies because we'll have to maybe build some capacity or take over their capacity and then bring it up to our standards. So I will tell you that we really believe that when we use M&A capital, our shareholders are expecting a certain return and by and large, we stick to those requirements regardless of the business unit."

I think we're still a little early in the process. When we gave guidance back in March for our fourth quarter, I think several people thought that we were being overly conservative with what we thought the paper price was going to be. So the expectation in the market was that it was going to increase a little quicker. Well, it didn't turn out to do so, at least through our fourth quarter.

Thank you for joining us as we report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results and our fiscal 2013 guidance, we will be happy to answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $1,054,000,000. In an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, fourth quarter revenue grew 4.1% from last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 11.1% to $79 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 22.4% increase over last year. Mike will provide more details shortly on the fourth quarter performance. 
This fourth quarter concluded a very successful fiscal 2012 year for Cintas in which our revenue topped the $4 billion mark for the first time at $4,102,000,000 and our earnings per diluted share hit a record level of $2.27. Our employees, who we call partners, did a great job of executing our game plan throughout these past 12 months. Congratulations to our partners on their achievements this year. 
We remain confident in our business' opportunities and our ability to execute our game plan. As such, during our fourth quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares of Cintas stock at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million. Since these purchases were made so late in the fiscal year, they had no impact on our fourth quarter results. However, we expect it will positively increase fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. This impact is incorporated into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Our Board authorized a $500 million share buyback program in October 2011, so we now have $370.4 million remaining of that authorization. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."
260725,213708552,326015,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2012",2012-07-16,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.8% mainly due to lower recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there are 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which was the same as last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is 1 less than fiscal 2012. The difference occurs in the third quarter, where there were 65 workdays in fiscal 2012. The 1 less workday in fiscal 2013 will negatively impact fiscal 2013 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the revenue; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%; and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%. 
Fourth quarter rental revenue was $749 million, which is up 5.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.2%. Growth continued to come in the form of new business, and sales rep productivity continue to be good. However, just as we have seen worsening trends in U.S. employment and in the general U.S. economy, our net add/stops trending worsened throughout the quarter. This worsening trend contributed to a slowing of the revenue growth rate from 6.5% organic growth in our third quarter. 
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the fourth quarter, a 30-basis-point decrease from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. This benefit, though, was offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business during the year, as well as the expected higher cotton impact. The worsening trend of net add/stops resulted in a greater percentage of revenue coming from new business, which requires injection of new inventory. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $111.2 million represents an increase of 2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.7% for the fourth quarter, which is down slightly from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. The gross margin of 30.7% was a slight improvement over the third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $108.9 million, an increase of 9.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9%. This segment had a very good fiscal year, growing 10.1% and topping $400 million for the full fiscal year. 
This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 41.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points lower this year compared to last year. In addition, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue decreased 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.2% compared to last year. 
Our Document Management fourth quarter performance was adversely affected by 3 things. First, the recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter. This resulted in a decrease of over 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This lower price negatively impacted revenue for the quarter by $7.4 million, and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Bill will discuss our fiscal 2013 recycled paper price assumptions in his guidance discussion. 
The second item to negatively affect performance was continuing difficulty in Europe. We have made operational and efficiency improvements in our businesses during this fiscal year, but revenue growth in the current environment is a challenge. 
And the third item to negatively affect fourth quarter results is the performance of our imaging business. The imaging business is largely a project business, and last year's fourth quarter benefited from several large onetime projects that did not reoccur this year. 
Despite the challenges of lower recycled paper prices, we continue to be pleased with the North American document shredding side of the business. We continue to move forward with our game plan of managing the business for the long-term benefit of our customers, selling profitable business and creating efficiencies from off-site shredding opportunities and from process improvements. Since the impact of lower recycled paper prices falls directly to the bottom line, the Document Management gross margin dropped to 46.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 51.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. This is an improvement from last year's fourth quarter of 30.1%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to managing our cost structure while continuing to grow revenue. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.8% of revenue were higher than the 28.5% in this year's third quarter due to a 50-basis-point increase in the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 39.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 36.8%, which is slightly lower than our expected rate of 37% due to the resolution of federal audits of our fiscal 2009 and 2010 years. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balance was $340 million at May 31, down $13 million from the $353 million in cash and marketable securities at February 29 primarily due to the share buyback of $130 million during the fourth quarter. Included in the $340 million at May 31 was $52 million of cash located outside of the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of a onetime opportunity to bring $110 million back into the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $11 million since February 29. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as of February 29. New goods inventory at May 31 was $251 million, down $25 million from February 29. This decrease was expected as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 29 primarily due to higher accrued bond interest and higher accrued profit sharing. 
Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We repaid $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt that matured on June 1, 2012. And we issued new 10-year debt on June 5 with a coupon of 3.25%. We issued the new debt due to the attractiveness of the interest rate levels. As of May 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA is slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $162 million, which is up from last year's fourth quarter amount of $133 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's fourth quarter added to the improvement over last year. 
CapEx for the fourth quarter was $43.1 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.2 million in Rental; $1.6 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $2.7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7.6 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."

Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. 
Let me walk through a few assumptions so you could better understand the guidance. This guidance certainly considers the current economic climate, which is not healthy. We have had 3 consecutive months of poor job creation. In fact, only 225,000 jobs were created in that time, about half of which were professional and administrative positions. The Institute for Supply Management indicated in June that exports fell and new factory orders dropped at the fastest pace since 2001. We've seen numerous U.S. GDP forecasts that show growth of less than 2% during the next 18 months. As Mike mentioned, our net add/stops trending worsened during the -- our fourth quarter, a reflection of our customers' concern and uncertainty at this time. Clearly, there is little momentum in the economy. 
Despite this lack of momentum, though, we remain encouraged by our business' performance and continue to expect our revenue to grow organically in the mid-single digits in this type of environment. As we have discussed on the last few calls, recycled paper prices have been quite a headwind during the last 2 quarters. We expect it to remain this way for the next 2 quarters. We have assumed that recycled paper prices increase about $10 per ton each quarter in fiscal 2013 from the $150 a ton level at May 31. Last year's first quarter average price was roughly $275 per ton, and the second quarter average price was roughly $225 per ton. Keep in mind that this pricing difference impacts both revenues -- both revenue and falls directly to operating income. Our energy-related expenses for fiscal 2012 were roughly 3.3% of sales. Our guidance assumes that fiscal 2013 energy-related expenses remain at this level. 
We recently issued $250 million of 10-year debt with a 3.25% coupon that essentially replaced the $225 million of debt that matured on June 1. Including all fees and the impacts of interest rate locks, this new debt will reduce overall interest expense by about $3.5 million. However, much of this benefit will be offset by a higher effective tax rate. We expect our fiscal 2013 effective rate to be 37.3%, which is higher than the 36.8% in fiscal 2012. As Mike discussed, the fiscal 2012 effective rate benefited from the resolution of audits. 
And finally, keep in mind that the guidance incorporates the share buybacks from our fourth quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, this will benefit fiscal 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.06. Hopefully, this additional color adds perspective to our guidance. With that, we will now be glad to take any of your questions."

As far as synergies, it so much depends, John, on the nature of where the customers are coming from, the size of the customers. If we have a deal whereby we have capacity in existing facilities in a region and we buy a local competitor that perhaps serves multiple cities, we can get a lot of synergies because we can deploy that new volume pretty easily in multiple facilities. The more concentrated the volume is that we get, the more likely it'll take a little longer to get those synergies because we'll have to maybe build some capacity or take over their capacity and then bring it up to our standards.

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results and our fiscal 2013 guidance, we will be happy to answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $1,054,000,000. In an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, fourth quarter revenue grew 4.1% from last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 11.1% to $79 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 22.4% increase over last year. Mike will provide more details shortly on the fourth quarter performance. 
This fourth quarter concluded a very successful fiscal 2012 year for Cintas in which our revenue topped the $4 billion mark for the first time at $4,102,000,000 and our earnings per diluted share hit a record level of $2.27. Our employees, who we call partners, did a great job of executing our game plan throughout this past 12 months. Congratulations to our partners on their achievements this year. 
We remain confident in our business' opportunities and our ability to execute our game plan. As such, during our fourth quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares of Cintas stock at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million. Since these purchases were made so late in the fiscal year, they had no impact on our fourth quarter results. However, we expect it will positively increase fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. This impact is incorporated into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Our board authorized a $500 million share buyback program in October 2011, so we now have $370.4 million remaining of that authorization. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."
260725,213708552,326025,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2012",2012-07-16,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.8% mainly due to lower recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there are 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which was the same as last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012. The difference occurs in the third quarter, where there were 65 workdays in fiscal 2012. The one less workday in fiscal 2013 will negatively impact fiscal 2013 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the revenue; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%; and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%. 
Fourth quarter rental revenue was $749 million, which is up 5.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.2%. Growth continued to come in the form of new business, and sales rep productivity continued to be good. However, just as we have seen worsening trends in U.S. employment and in the general U.S. economy, our net add/stops trending worsened throughout the quarter. This worsening trend contributed to a slowing of the revenue growth rate from 6.5% organic growth in our third quarter. 
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the fourth quarter, a 30-basis-point decrease from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. This benefit, though, was offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business during the year, as well as the expected higher cotton impact. The worsening trend of net add/stops resulted in a greater percentage of revenue coming from new business, which requires injection of new inventory. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $111.2 million represents an increase of 2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.7% for the fourth quarter, which is down slightly from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. The gross margin of 30.7% was a slight improvement over the third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $108.9 million, an increase of 9.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9%. This segment had a very good fiscal year, growing 10.1% and topping $400 million for the full fiscal year. 
This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 41.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points lower this year compared to last year. In addition, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue decreased 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.2% compared to last year. 
Our Document Management fourth quarter performance was adversely affected by 3 things. First, the recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter. This resulted in a decrease of over 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This lower price negatively impacted revenue for the quarter by $7.4 million, and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Bill will discuss our fiscal 2013 recycled paper price assumptions in his guidance discussion. 
The second item to negatively affect performance was continuing difficulty in Europe. We have made operational and efficiency improvements in our businesses during this fiscal year, but revenue growth in the current environment is a challenge. 
And the third item to negatively affect fourth quarter results is the performance of our imaging business. The imaging business is largely a project business, and last year's fourth quarter benefited from several large onetime projects that did not reoccur this year. 
Despite the challenges of lower recycled paper prices, we continue to be pleased with the North American document shredding side of the business. We continue to move forward with our game plan of managing the business for the long-term benefit of our customers, selling profitable business and creating efficiencies from off-site shredding opportunities and from process improvements. Since the impact of lower recycled paper prices falls directly to the bottom line, the Document Management gross margin dropped to 46.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 51.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. This is an improvement from last year's fourth quarter of 30.1%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to managing our cost structure while continuing to grow revenue. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.8% of revenue were higher than the 28.5% in this year's third quarter due to a 50-basis-point increase in the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 39.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 36.8%, which is slightly lower than our expected rate of 37% due to the resolution of federal audits of our fiscal 2009 and 2010 years. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balance was $340 million at May 31, down $13 million from the $353 million in cash and marketable securities at February 29 primarily due to the share buyback of $130 million during the fourth quarter. Included in the $340 million at May 31 was $52 million of cash located outside of the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of a onetime opportunity to bring $110 million back into the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $11 million since February 29. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at February 29. New goods inventory at May 31 was $251 million, down $25 million from February 29. This decrease was expected as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 29 primarily due to higher accrued bond interest and higher accrued profit sharing. 
Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We repaid $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt that matured on June 1, 2012. And we issued new 10-year debt on June 5 with a coupon of 3.25%. We issued the new debt due to the attractiveness of the interest rate levels. As of May 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA is slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $162 million, which is up from last year's fourth quarter amount of $133 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's fourth quarter added to the improvement over last year. 
CapEx for the fourth quarter was $43.1 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.2 million in Rental; $1.6 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $2.7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7.6 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance."
260725,213708552,326025,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2012",2012-07-16,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidan",471,"Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. 
Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. This guidance certainly considers the current economic climate, which is not healthy. We have had 3 consecutive months of poor job creation. In fact, only 225,000 jobs were created in that time, about half of which were professional and administrative positions. The Institute for Supply Management indicated in June that exports fell and new factory orders dropped at the fastest pace since 2001. We've seen numerous U.S. GDP forecasts that show growth of less than 2% during the next 18 months. As Mike mentioned, our net add/stops trending worsened during the -- our fourth quarter, a reflection of our customers' concern and uncertainty at this time. Clearly, there is little momentum in the economy. 
Despite this lack of momentum, though, we remain encouraged by our business' performance and continue to expect our revenue to grow organically in the mid-single digits in this type of environment. As we have discussed on the last few calls, recycled paper prices have been quite a headwind during the last 2 quarters. We expect it to remain this way for the next 2 quarters. We have assumed that recycled paper prices increase about $10 per ton each quarter in fiscal 2013 from the $150 a ton level at May 31. Last year's first quarter average price was roughly $275 per ton, and the second quarter average price was roughly $225 per ton. Keep in mind that this pricing difference impacts both revenues -- both revenue and falls directly to operating income. Our energy-related expenses for fiscal 2012 were roughly 3.3% of sales. Our guidance assumes that fiscal 2013 energy-related expenses remain at this level. 
We recently issued $250 million of 10-year debt with a 3.25% coupon that essentially replaced the $225 million of debt that matured on June 1. Including all fees and the impacts of interest rate locks, this new debt will reduce overall interest expense by about $3.5 million. However, much of this benefit will be offset by a higher effective tax rate. We expect our fiscal 2013 effective rate to be 37.3%, which is higher than the 36.8% in fiscal 2012. As Mike discussed, the fiscal 2012 effective rate benefited from the resolution of audits. 
And finally, keep in mind that the guidance incorporates the share buybacks from our fourth quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, this will benefit fiscal 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.06. Hopefully, this additional color adds perspective to our guidance. With that, we will now be glad to take any of your questions."

If we have a deal whereby we have capacity in existing facilities in a region and we buy a local competitor that perhaps serves multiple cities, we can get a lot of synergies because we can deploy that new volume pretty easily in multiple facilities. The more concentrated the volume is that we get, the more likely it'll take a little longer to get those synergies because we'll have to maybe build some capacity or take over their capacity and then bring it up to our standards.

We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,051,000,000, which represents growth of 3.4% from last year's first quarter. First quarter net income increased by 11.8% to $77 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 15.4% increase over last year. Our operating margin for the first quarter improved to 13.2% from last year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower in last year's first quarter. However, this positive impact from energy was more than offset by the $8.3 million negative impact of lower recycled paper prices this year. Keep in mind that in addition to negatively impacting revenue, lower recycled paper prices directly impact operating income as well. Aside from these 2 items, the improvement in operating margin was mainly due to continued efforts to manage our cost structure. 
When we announced our fiscal 2013 guidance in July, we commented that the absence of momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as numerous sub-2% GDP forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 caused us to view fiscal 2013 with caution. Our assessment of the economic climate has not changed since then. The disappointing employment picture has continued and various reported economic data during the past 2 months have not been encouraging. However, despite this negative climate, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, and as a result, we reiterate our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. We are updating our fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share guidance for the impact of our first quarter share buyback. While the $1.8 millions share buyback had no impact on the first quarter results, it will benefit the remainder of the year by $0.03. As a result, we now expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. 
Let me make a few comments about this guidance. The guidance assumes no further deterioration in the U.S. economy. Mike generally comments on the workdays by quarter. The number of workdays does affect revenue and operating income levels. Keep in mind that our second quarter workdays are 65, 1 less than the first quarter, but the same as last year's second quarter. The third quarter however, has only 64 workdays, 2 less than this first quarter and 1 less than last year's third quarter. This third quarter workday impact, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding a fiscal cliff impact, may result in a difficult year-over-year comparison for the third quarter. 
While the first quarter recycled paper prices were significantly lower than last year, those prices were generally in line with our expectations. Our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed since July, roughly $170 per ton in the second quarter, followed by a $10 increase in the third and fourth quarters. And finally, as I mentioned, the guidance incorporates a share buyback from our first quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gr",1510,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.2% due to lower recycled paper prices and higher material cost. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you again that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The workdays in the second and fourth quarters are the same as last year but the third quarter has 1 less workday, as Bill mentioned, than last fiscal year, when there were 65 working days in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter rental revenue was $754.8 million, which is up 4.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 4.9%. 
We are pleased with our revenue performance for the quarter despite the sluggish economic environment. Our sales reps continued to perform at relatively high productivity levels and our lost business improved from last year's first quarter. During our July earnings release call to report fourth quarter results, we indicated that our net adds stops trend worsened in that fourth quarter. That trend did not continue to worsen through the first quarter. Historically, we have experienced a seasonal pickup in net adds stops from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we did in fact see that normal pickup during the third quarter. 
Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the first quarter, a 60-basis-point decrease from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.9%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. This benefit though was primarily offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business from the past several quarters and the expected greater cotton impact. High levels of new business require incremental injection of new inventory. The first quarter gross margin of 43.3% was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $100.3 million represents a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year's first quarter. We have seen some softening in our Rental catalog business which is consistent with the general cautiousness of our customers. But this revenue level was consistent with our internal plan. We are currently gearing up for several large rollouts scheduled for the second half of the fiscal year and expect this operating segment to have a good year. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter, which is up 80 basis points from last year's first quarter gross margin of 28.6%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. Revenue was $110.8 million, which is record quarterly revenue level for this operating segment. It was an increase of 6.8% versus last year's first quarter revenue, with organic growth being 6.6%. We're pleased with the performance of both the First Aid and safety business and the fire protection business. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the first quarter, which is about the same as last year's first quarter of 43.2%. Improvements in warehouse capacity utilization and lower energy related costs were offset by expanded rail capacity due to this operating segment's growth over the past year. 
The first quarter gross margin of 43.1% was an improvement over the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 7.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.3% compared to last year. Year-over-year Document Management results continue to be negatively affected by lower recycled paper prices and difficult operating conditions in Europe, including a weaker euro. The average recycled paper price during the first quarter was roughly $170 per ton, which was an improvement from last year's fourth quarter average of roughly $150 per ton. However, the first quarter average of $170 per ton was a significant drop from last year's first quarter average of $275 per ton. This lower year-over-year price negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter by $8.3 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. 
Europe continues to be a challenging operating environment. Revenue growth has been difficult and the weaker euro relative to last year's first quarter level negatively impacted the results. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.2% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter. This is an improvement from last year's first quarter of 34.5%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to improved worker's comp claims experienced and lower amortization of deferred charges related to prior year acquisitions. First quarter selling and administrative expenses of 29.2% of revenue were higher than the 28.8% in last year's fourth quarter, in part due to normal first quarter expenses as we begin our fiscal year. 
Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter compared to 38.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $330 million at August 31, down $10 million from the $340 million in cash at May 31, primarily due to the share buyback of $71 million during the first quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $330 million at August 31 was $49 million of cash located outside of the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since May 31. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at May 31. New goods inventory at August 31 was $242 million, down $9 million from May 31. Inventory continued to normalize during the quarter from higher post-SAP conversion levels. We're now seeing some efficiency gains from SAP. We do expect an increase in the remainder of the year due to the large rollouts in Uniform Direct Sales mentioned earlier. Accrued liabilities decreased to $43 million compared to May 31, primarily due to lower accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. We had $225 million of 6% 10-year debt mature on June 1 and we refinanced that with a new issue of $250 million 10-year debt on June 5, with a coupon of 3.25%. As of August 31, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $95 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $57 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's first quarter and an increase in accounts payable added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the first quarter was $47.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $32.1 million in Rental; $2.4 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.9 million in First Aid safety and fire protection; and $9 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

First off, it's the value of the program itself. We've talked a lot about that. The fact that you can get 5 changes each week of uniforms, no investment by the company or the employee in the uniforms and get them all taken care of for a relatively modest price is a phenomenal value. And I think that more and more companies continue to see that and that's why our business results, new business results, primarily the majority of it is the no programmers segment. I think the second reason is some of the product offerings that we have. We've talked a lot about our relationship with Carhartt. We continue to see very nice results in the FRC garment, the flame-resistant garment, especially in the energy sector, which is a growing sector in the U.S. economy. And then I'd say that next thing is in the Rental business, our facility services business, which is about 1/2 of that total rentals segment. We continue to have very nice offerings for resolving some of the problems that companies face and such things as the floor care solutions, which includes the tile and carpet cleaning, the hygiene solutions, the restroom supplies. And then the addition of the chemical cleaning systems that we have out there I think have all helped on that side of the business. So with all that said, I think our new business results continue to be good. Lost business continues to show some modest improvement year-over-year. We're just not getting the adds yet from existing customers. Maybe when the economy turns around after there's some certainty, we'll begin to really see that and see our growth accelerate."

We also have seen some better performance on the part of -- in our worker's comp and our medical expenses, which have helped the union bite is, for the most part, over. So that has certainly helped some of the legal expenses that we were incurring. So I think we're back to where we want to be with a growing top line and leveraging that G&A. On the sales side, we believe that we have staffed appropriately for all of our businesses in order to grow those businesses and I think our new business results have been very good over the last couple of years, reflecting this high productivity level we're getting from the salesforce. We continue to increase appropriately, in the correct markets, the number of salespeople we have. But I don't think we're going to need to do a significant step up in that in order to get our growth. We feel that where we're at is appropriate and it will be modest growth going forward.

First off, it will be -- we're pretty certain on the direct sale business, as Mike mentioned, that you're going to see an acceleration in that because we've got some large rollouts. And that's in the plan and embedded in the guidance. But to get to the top end of the guidance, what I would say you would see is a better economy. Therefore, an improvement in the confidence level on the part of business owners to either add employees or to make discretionary spend, as we've talked our catalog business was relatively flat. We think a lot of that is just caution on the part of the business owner. We could see getting to the top end of that range caused by the better-than-expected increase in paper prices than what we've embedded in there. And I would just say, employers just willing to add an employee here or there is going to have a positive impact on that. With all that said, I want to reiterate a point that Mike made and I try to make is, as you guys lay out your guidance, keep in mind this third quarter has these fewer number of workdays, and also I think the most difficult period we may have is right around the end of the calendar year. So our guidance anticipates that the fourth quarter should be pretty decent, third quarter is not going to be quite as good just because of all these other factors that are going on. But I'd say we have pretty good confidence in the guidance that we gave you and hopefully we'll be able to achieve that top end of the things that I've mentioned earlier happen."

And I'll tell you, last year's first quarter was a pretty good quarter. That 43.9 was a quarter we hadn't seen in the last 3 or in the previous couple. And part of that was due to we started to see an acceleration in our Rental business. We were getting a lot of leverage and the growth is causing us to now add some routes and to add some resources.

So that added impact on it. We're just not seeing much growth at all in storage and therefore, that's one of the reasons we've always said that our preference is more on the treading side. The European business is, we beat that quite a bit with the euro and with just the lack of growth over there. While it's only 1% of our overall company's revenue, it's a little bit bigger piece of the Document Management segment. And then I would say that in the shredding side, the focus has been selling good business. There were some aggressive companies out there in the business that we don't think are necessarily long-term committed to the business, that were getting pretty aggressive in the fourth quarter last year and even into a little bit of the first quarter this year. But that seems to be stabilizing a bit because they're seeing the result of the lower paper prices and it's impacting their profit margins. We've got some nice customer rollouts in place, are going to be in place here in the next couple of quarters that are really good wins for us.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,051,000,000, which represents growth of 3.4% from last year's first quarter. First quarter net income increased by 11.8% to $77 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 15.4% increase over last year. Our operating margin for the first quarter improved to 13.2% from last year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower in last year's first quarter. However, this positive impact from energy was more than offset by the $8.3 million negative impact of lower recycled paper prices this year. Keep in mind that in addition to negatively impacting revenue, lower recycled paper prices directly impact operating income as well. Aside from these 2 items, the improvement in operating margin was mainly due to continued efforts to manage our cost structure. 
When we announced our fiscal 2013 guidance in July, we commented that the absence of momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as numerous sub-2% GDP forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 caused us to view fiscal 2013 with caution. Our assessment of the economic climate has not changed since then. The disappointing employment picture has continued and various reported economic data during the past 2 months have not been encouraging. However, despite this negative climate, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, and as a result, we reiterate our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. We are updating our fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share guidance for the impact of our first quarter share buyback. While the 1.8 million share buyback had no impact on the first quarter results, it will benefit the remainder of the year by $0.03. As a result, we now expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. 
Let me make a few comments about this guidance. The guidance assumes no further deterioration in the U.S. economy. Mike generally comments on the workdays by quarter. The number of workdays does affect revenue and operating income levels. Keep in mind that our second quarter workdays are 65, 1 less than the first quarter, but the same as last year's second quarter. The third quarter however, has only 64 workdays, 2 less than this first quarter and 1 less than last year's third quarter. This third quarter workday impact, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding a fiscal cliff impact, may result in a difficult year-over-year comparison for the third quarter. 
While the first quarter recycled paper prices were significantly lower than last year, those prices were generally in line with our expectations. Our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed since July, roughly $170 per ton in the second quarter, followed by a $10 increase in the third and fourth quarters. And finally, as I mentioned, the guidance incorporates the share buyback from our first quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.2% due to lower recycled paper prices and higher material cost. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you again that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The workdays in the second and fourth quarters are the same as last year. The third quarter has 1 less workday, as Bill mentioned, than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter Rental revenue was $754.8 million, which is up 4.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 4.9%. 
We are pleased with our revenue performance for the quarter despite the sluggish economic environment. Our sales reps continued to perform at relatively high productivity levels and our lost business improved from last year's first quarter. During our July earnings release call to report fourth quarter results, we indicated that our net adds stops trend worsened in that fourth quarter. That trend did not continue to worsen through the first quarter. Historically, we have experienced a seasonal pickup in net adds stops from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we did, in fact, see that normal pickup during the third quarter. 
Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.3% for the first quarter, a 60-basis-point decrease from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.9%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. This benefit though, was primarily offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business from the past several quarters and the expected greater cotton impact. High levels of new business require incremental injection of new inventory. The first quarter gross margin of 43.3% was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $100.3 million represents a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year's first quarter. We have seen some softening in our Rental catalog business which is consistent with the general cautiousness of our customers but this revenue level was consistent with our internal plan. We are currently gearing up for several large rollouts scheduled for the second half of the fiscal year and expect this operating segment to have a good year. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter, which is up 80 basis points from last year's first quarter gross margin of 28.6%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. Revenue was $110.8 million, which is a record quarterly revenue level for this operating segment. It was an increase of 6.8% versus last year's first quarter revenue, with organic growth being 6.6%. We're pleased with the performance of both the First Aid and Safety business and the Fire Protection business. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the first quarter, which is about the same as last year's first quarter of 43.2%. Improvements in warehouse capacity utilization and lower energy related costs were offset by expanded route capacity due to this operating segment's growth over the past year. 
The first quarter gross margin of 43.1% was an improvement over the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 7.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.3% compared to last year. Year-over-year Document Management results continue to be negatively affected by lower recycled paper prices and difficult operating conditions in Europe, including a weaker euro. The average recycled paper price during the first quarter was roughly $170 per ton, which was an improvement from last year's fourth quarter average of roughly $150 per ton. However, the first quarter average of $170 per ton was a significant drop from last year's first quarter average of $275 per ton. This lower year-over-year price negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter by $8.3 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. 
Europe continues to be a challenging operating environment. Revenue growth has been difficult and the weaker euro relative to last year's first quarter level negatively impacted the results. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.2% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter. This is an improvement from last year's first quarter of 30.5%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to improved worker's comp claims experienced and lower amortization of deferred charges related to prior year acquisitions. First quarter selling and administrative expenses of 29.2% of revenue were higher than the 28.8% in last year's fourth quarter, in part due to normal first quarter expenses as we began our fiscal year. 
Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter compared to 38.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $330 million at August 31, down $10 million from the $340 million in cash at May 31, primarily due to the share buyback of $71 million during the first quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $330 million at August 31 was $49 million of cash located outside of the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since May 31. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at May 31. New goods inventory at August 31 was $242 million, down $9 million from May 31. Inventory continued to normalize during the quarter from higher post-SAP conversion levels. We're now seeing some efficiency gains from SAP. We do expect an increase in the remainder of the year due to the large rollouts in Uniform Direct Sales mentioned earlier. Accrued liabilities decreased to $43 million compared to May 31, primarily due to lower accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. We had $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt mature on June 1 and we refinanced that with a new issue of $250 million, 10-year debt on June 5, with a coupon of 3.25%. As of August 31, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $95 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $57 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's first quarter and an increase in accounts payable added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the first quarter was $47.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $32.1 million in Rental; $2.4 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.9 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

First off, it's the value of the program itself. We've talked a lot about that. The fact that you can get 5 changes each week of uniforms, no investment by the company or the employee in the uniforms and get them all taken care of for a relatively modest price is a phenomenal value. And I think that more and more companies continue to see that and that's why our business results, new business results, primarily the majority of it is the no programmer segment. I think the second reason is some of the product offerings that we have. We've talked a lot about our relationship with Carhartt. We continue to see very nice results in the FRC garment, the flame-resistant garment, especially in the energy sector, which is a growing sector in the U.S. economy. And then I'd say that next thing is in the Rental business, our Facility Services business, which is over 1/2 -- or which is about 1/2 of that total Rental segment. We continue to have very nice offerings for resolving some of the problems that companies face in such things as the floor care solutions, which includes the tile and carpet cleaning, the hygiene solutions, the restroom supplies and then the addition of the chemical cleaning systems that we have out there, I think, have all helped on that side of the business. So with all that said, I think our new business results continue to be good. Lost business continues to show some modest improvement year-over-year. We're just not getting the adds yet from existing customers. Maybe when the economy turns around after there's some certainty, we'll begin to really see that and see our growth accelerate."

On the sales side, we believe that we have staffed appropriately for all of our businesses in order to grow those businesses and I think our new business results have been very good over the last couple of years, reflecting this high productivity level we're getting from the salesforce.

First off, it will be -- we're pretty certain on the direct sale business, as Mike mentioned, that you're going to see an acceleration in that because we've got some large rollouts and that's in the plan and embedded in the guidance. But to get to the top end of the guidance, what I would say you would see is a better economy. Therefore, an improvement in the confidence level on the part of business owners to either add employees or to make discretionary spends. As we've talked, our catalog business was relatively flat. We think a lot of that is just caution on the part of the business owner. We could see getting to the top end of that range caused by the better-than-expected increase in paper prices than what we've embedded in there. And I would just say, employers just willing to add an employee here or there is going to have a positive impact on that. With all that said, I want to reiterate a point that Mike made and I try to make is, as you guys lay out your guidance, keep in mind this third quarter has these fewer number of workdays, and also I think the most difficult period we may have is right around the end of the calendar year. So our guidance anticipates that the fourth quarter should be pretty decent, third quarter is not going to be quite as good just because of all these other factors that are going on. But I'd say we have pretty good confidence in the guidance that we gave you and hopefully, we'll be able to achieve that top end of the things that I've mentioned earlier, happen."

And I'll tell you, last year's first quarter was a pretty good quarter. That 43.9% was a quarter we hadn't seen in the last 3 or in the previous couple.

So that added impact on it. We're just not seeing much growth at all in storage and therefore, that's one of the reasons we've always said that our preference is more on the treading side. The European businesses, we beat that quite a bit with the euro and with just the lack of growth over there. While it's only 1% of our overall company's revenue, it's a little bit bigger piece of the Document Management segment. And then I would say that in the shredding side, the focus has been selling good business. There has -- there were some aggressive companies out there in the business that we don't think are necessarily long-term committed to the business, that were getting pretty aggressive in the fourth quarter last year and even into a little bit of the first quarter this year. But that seems to be stabilizing a bit because they're seeing the result of the lower paper prices and it's impacting their profit margins. We've got some nice customer rollouts in place, are going to be in place here in the next couple of quarters that are really good wins for us.

The Private Securities",633,"Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our first quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,051,000,000, which represents growth of 3.4% from last year's first quarter. First quarter net income increased by 11.8% to $77 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 15.4% increase over last year. Our operating margin for the first quarter improved to 13.2% from last year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower in last year's first quarter. However, this positive impact from energy was more than offset by the $8.3 million negative impact of lower recycled paper prices this year. Keep in mind that in addition to negatively impacting revenue, lower recycled paper prices directly impact operating income as well. Aside from these 2 items, the improvement in operating margin was mainly due to continued efforts to manage our cost structure. 
When we announced our fiscal 2013 guidance in July, we commented that the absence of momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as numerous sub-2% GDP forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 caused us to view fiscal 2013 with caution. Our assessment of the economic climate has not changed since then. The disappointing employment picture has continued and various reported economic data during the past 2 months have not been encouraging. However, despite this negative climate, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, and as a result, we reiterate our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. We are updating our fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share guidance for the impact of our first quarter share buyback. While the 1.8 million share buyback had no impact on the first quarter results, it will benefit the remainder of the year by $0.03. As a result, we now expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. 
Let me make a few comments about this guidance. The guidance assumes no further deterioration in the U.S. economy. Mike generally comments on the workdays by quarter. The number of workdays does affect revenue and operating income levels. Keep in mind that our second quarter workdays are 65, 1 less than the first quarter, but the same as last year's second quarter. The third quarter however, has only 64 workdays, 2 less than this first quarter and 1 less than last year's third quarter. This third quarter workday impact, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding a fiscal cliff impact, may result in a difficult year-over-year comparison for the third quarter. 
While the first quarter recycled paper prices were significantly lower than last year, those prices were generally in line with our expectations. Our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed since July, roughly $170 per ton in the second quarter, followed by a $10 increase in the third and fourth quarters. And finally as I mentioned, the guidance incorporates the share buyback from our first quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter."
260725,216955769,360365,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Sep 20, 2012",2012-09-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gr",1509,"Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.2% due to lower recycled paper prices and higher material cost. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you again that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The workdays in the second and fourth quarters are the same as last year. The third quarter has 1 less workday, as Bill mentioned, than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter Rental revenue was $754.8 million, which is up 4.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 4.9%. 
We are pleased with our revenue performance for the quarter despite the sluggish economic environment. Our sales reps continued to perform at relatively high productivity levels and our lost business improved from last year's first quarter. During our July earnings release call to report fourth quarter results, we indicated that our net adds stops trend worsened in that fourth quarter. That trend did not continue to worsen through the first quarter. Historically, we have experienced a seasonal pickup in net adds stops from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we did, in fact, see that normal pickup during the third quarter. 
Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.3% for the first quarter, a 60-basis-point decrease from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.9%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. This benefit though, was primarily offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business from the past several quarters and the expected greater cotton impact. High levels of new business require incremental injection of new inventory. The first quarter gross margin of 43.3% was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $100.3 million represents a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year's first quarter. We have seen some softening in our Rental catalog business which is consistent with the general cautiousness of our customers, but this revenue level was consistent with our internal plan. We are currently gearing up for several large rollouts scheduled for the second half of the fiscal year and expect this operating segment to have a good year. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter, which is up 80 basis points from last year's first quarter gross margin of 28.6%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. Revenue was $110.8 million, which is a record quarterly revenue level for this operating segment. It was an increase of 6.8% versus last year's first quarter revenue, with organic growth being 6.6%. We're pleased with the performance of both the First Aid and Safety business and the Fire Protection business. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the first quarter, which is about the same as last year's first quarter of 43.2%. Improvements in warehouse capacity utilization and lower energy related costs were offset by expanded route capacity due to this operating segment's growth over the past year. 
The first quarter gross margin of 43.1% was an improvement over the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 7.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.3% compared to last year. Year-over-year Document Management results continue to be negatively affected by lower recycled paper prices and difficult operating conditions in Europe, including a weaker euro. The average recycled paper price during the first quarter was roughly $170 per ton, which was an improvement from last year's fourth quarter average of roughly $150 per ton. However, the first quarter average of $170 per ton was a significant drop from last year's first quarter average of $275 per ton. This lower year-over-year price negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter by $8.3 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. 
Europe continues to be a challenging operating environment. Revenue growth has been difficult and the weaker euro relative to last year's first quarter level negatively impacted the results. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.2% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter. This is an improvement from last year's first quarter of 30.5%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to improved worker's comp claims experienced and lower amortization of deferred charges related to prior year acquisitions. First quarter selling and administrative expenses of 29.2% of revenue were higher than the 28.8% in last year's fourth quarter, in part due to normal first quarter expenses as we began our fiscal year. 
Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter compared to 38.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $330 million at August 31, down $10 million from the $340 million in cash at May 31, primarily due to the share buyback of $71 million during the first quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $330 million at August 31 was $49 million of cash located outside of the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since May 31. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at May 31. New goods inventory at August 31 was $242 million, down $9 million from May 31. Inventory continued to normalize during the quarter from higher post-SAP conversion levels. We're now seeing some efficiency gains from SAP. We do expect an increase in the remainder of the year due to the large rollouts in Uniform Direct Sales mentioned earlier. Accrued liabilities decreased to $43 million compared to May 31, primarily due to lower accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. We had $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt mature on June 1 and we refinanced that with a new issue of $250 million, 10-year debt on June 5, with a coupon of 3.25%. As of August 31, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $95 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $57 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's first quarter and an increase in accounts payable added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the first quarter was $47.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $32.1 million in Rental; $2.4 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.9 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

First off, it's the value of the program itself. We've talked a lot about that. The fact that you can get 5 changes each week of uniforms, no investment by the company or the employee in the uniforms and get them all taken care of for a relatively modest price is a phenomenal value. And I think that more and more companies continue to see that and that's why our business results, new business results, primarily the majority of it is the no programmer segment. I think the second reason is some of the product offerings that we have. We've talked a lot about our relationship with Carhartt. We continue to see very nice results in the FRC garment, the flame-resistant garment, especially in the energy sector, which is a growing sector in the U.S. economy. And then I'd say that next thing is in the Rental business, our Facility Services business, which is over 1/2 -- or which is about 1/2 of that total Rental segment. We continue to have very nice offerings for resolving some of the problems that companies face in such things as the floor care solutions, which includes the tile and carpet cleaning, the hygiene solutions, the restroom supplies and then the addition of the chemical cleaning systems that we have out there I think have all helped on that side of the business. So with all that said, I think our new business results continue to be good. Lost business continues to show some modest improvement year-over-year. We're just not getting the adds yet from existing customers. Maybe when the economy turns around after there's some certainty, we'll begin to really see that and see our growth accelerate."

We also have seen some better performance on the part of our -- in our workman's comp and our medical expenses, which have helped. The union bite is, for the most part, over. So that has certainly helped some of the legal expenses that we were incurring. So I think that we're back to where we want to be with a growing top line and leveraging that G&A. On the sales side, we believe that we have staffed appropriately for all of our businesses in order to grow those businesses and I think our new business results have been very good over the last couple of years, reflecting this high productivity level we're getting from the salesforce. We continue to increase appropriately in the correct markets the number of salespeople we have, but I don't think we're going to need to do a significant step up in that in order to get our growth. We feel that where we're at is appropriate and it will be modest growth going forward. What we would like to see again, as Mike mentioned, is some existing customer growth when they add back employees. And if we can get that, then we'll return to double-digit company growth that we've been talking about for years."

I just want to maybe, Bill, to get a little perspective from you. What are some of the variables that could suggest what -- in what you're seeing today, what are some of the variables that could help you get to that high end of the guidance range?"

First off, it will be -- we're pretty certain on the direct sale business, as Mike mentioned, that you're going to see an acceleration in that because we've got some large rollouts and that's in the plan and embedded in the guidance. But to get to the top end of the guidance, what I would say you would see is a better economy. Therefore, an improvement in the confidence level on the part of business owners to either add employees or to make discretionary spends. As we've talked, our catalog business was relatively flat. We think a lot of that is just caution on the part of the business owner. We could see getting to the top end of that range caused by the better-than-expected increase in paper prices than what we've embedded in there. And I would just say, employers just willing to add an employee here or there is going to have a positive impact on that. With all that said, I want to reiterate a point that Mike made and I try to make is, as you guys lay out your guidance, keep in mind this third quarter has these fewer number of workdays, and also I think the most difficult period we may have is right around the end of the calendar year. So our guidance anticipates that the fourth quarter should be pretty decent, third quarter is not going to be quite as good just because of all these other factors that are going on. But I'd say we have pretty good confidence in the guidance that we gave you and hopefully, we'll be able to achieve that top end of the things that I've mentioned earlier, happen."

But generally speaking, we saw -- I think if you look at the rental gross margin in our first quarter, it was pretty consistent with the previous 3 quarters. And I'll tell you, last year's first quarter was a pretty good quarter. That 43.9% was a quarter we hadn't seen in the last 3 or in the previous couple. And part of that was due to we started to see an acceleration in our Rental business. We were getting a lot of leverage and the growth is causing us to now add some routes and to add some resources. And so, our first quarter was consistent with the previous 3. We just had a really nice quarter in the first quarter of '11."

And as we've mentioned last in the fourth quarter recall, one of our strategies is to get more recurring business there but we had a lot of kind of what I'd call onetime project, especially in the financial institutions. So that added impact on it. We're just not seeing much growth at all in storage and therefore, that's one of the reasons we've always said that our preference is more on the treading side. The European businesses, we beat that quite a bit with the euro and with just the lack of growth over there. While it's only 1% of our overall company's revenue, it's a little bit bigger piece of the Document Management segment. And then I would say that in the shredding side, the focus has been selling good business. There has -- there were some aggressive companies out there in the business that we don't think are necessarily long-term committed to the business that were getting pretty aggressive in the fourth quarter last year and even into a little bit of the first quarter this year. But that seems to be stabilizing a bit because they're seeing the result of the lower paper prices and it's impacting their profit margins. We've got some nice customer rollouts in place, are going to be in place here in the next couple of quarters that are really good wins for us. So we expect this growth rate, especially on the shredding side, to really start picking up. And then the comparables, of course in paper are going to become much easier as we go through the year."

In document shredding, there certainly are some big players there and I think most of you know who those are. Iron Mountain, Shred-It, Recall, all have very good sized shredding operations. There still are hundreds and hundreds of small and some moderate, regional-type players there that we continue to have some discussions with. So I think there'll be some opportunities presenting themselves there.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,051,000,000, which represents growth of 3.4% from last year's first quarter. First quarter net income increased by 11.8% to $77 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 15.4% increase over last year. Our operating margin for the first quarter improved to 13.2% from last year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower in last year's first quarter. However, this positive impact from energy was more than offset by the $8.3 million negative impact of lower recycled paper prices this year. Keep in mind that in addition to negatively impacting revenue, lower recycled paper prices directly impact operating income as well. Aside from these 2 items, the improvement in operating margin was mainly due to continued efforts to manage our cost structure. 
When we announced our fiscal 2013 guidance in July, we commented that the absence of momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as numerous sub-2% GDP forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 caused us to view fiscal 2013 with caution. Our assessment of the economic climate has not changed since then. The disappointing employment picture has continued and various reported economic data during the past 2 months have not been encouraging. However, despite this negative climate, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, and as a result, we reiterate our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. We are updating our fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share guidance for the impact of our first quarter share buyback. While the 1.8 million share buyback had no impact on the first quarter results, it will benefit the remainder of the year by $0.03. As a result, we now expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. 
Let me make a few comments about this guidance. The guidance assumes no further deterioration in the U.S. economy. Mike generally comments on the workdays by quarter. The number of workdays does affect revenue and operating income levels. Keep in mind that our second quarter workdays are 65, 1 less than the first quarter, but the same as last year's second quarter. The third quarter however, has only 64 workdays, 2 less than this first quarter and 1 less than last year's third quarter. This third quarter workday impact, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding a fiscal cliff impact, may result in a difficult year-over-year comparison for the third quarter. 
While the first quarter recycled paper prices were significantly lower than last year, those prices were generally in line with our expectations. Our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed since July, roughly $170 per ton in the second quarter, followed by a $10 increase in the third and fourth quarters. And finally as I mentioned, the guidance incorporates the share buyback from our first quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.2% due to lower recycled paper prices and higher material cost. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you again that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The workdays in the second and fourth quarters are the same as last year. The third quarter has 1 less workday, as Bill mentioned, than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter Rental revenue was $754.8 million, which is up 4.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 4.9%. 
We are pleased with our revenue performance for the quarter despite the sluggish economic environment. Our sales reps continued to perform at relatively high productivity levels and our lost business improved from last year's first quarter. During our July earnings release call to report fourth quarter results, we indicated that our net adds stops trend worsened in that fourth quarter. That trend did not continue to worsen through the first quarter. Historically, we have experienced a seasonal pickup in net adds stops from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we did, in fact, see that normal pickup during the third quarter. 
Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.3% for the first quarter, a 60-basis-point decrease from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.9%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. This benefit though, was primarily offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business from the past several quarters and the expected greater cotton impact. High levels of new business require incremental injection of new inventory. The first quarter gross margin of 43.3% was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $100.3 million represents a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year's first quarter. We have seen some softening in our Rental catalog business which is consistent with the general cautiousness of our customers, but this revenue level was consistent with our internal plan. We are currently gearing up for several large rollouts scheduled for the second half of the fiscal year and expect this operating segment to have a good year. 
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter, which is up 80 basis points from last year's first quarter gross margin of 28.6%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. 
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. Revenue was $110.8 million, which is a record quarterly revenue level for this operating segment. It was an increase of 6.8% versus last year's first quarter revenue, with organic growth being 6.6%. We're pleased with the performance of both the First Aid and Safety business and the Fire Protection business. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the first quarter, which is about the same as last year's first quarter of 43.2%. Improvements in warehouse capacity utilization and lower energy related costs were offset by expanded route capacity due to this operating segment's growth over the past year. 
The first quarter gross margin of 43.1% was an improvement over the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 7.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.3% compared to last year. Year-over-year Document Management results continue to be negatively affected by lower recycled paper prices and difficult operating conditions in Europe, including a weaker euro. The average recycled paper price during the first quarter was roughly $170 per ton, which was an improvement from last year's fourth quarter average of roughly $150 per ton. However, the first quarter average of $170 per ton was a significant drop from last year's first quarter average of $275 per ton. This lower year-over-year price negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter by $8.3 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. 
Europe continues to be a challenging operating environment. Revenue growth has been difficult and the weaker euro relative to last year's first quarter level negatively impacted the results. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.2% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter. This is an improvement from last year's first quarter of 30.5%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to improved worker's comp claims experienced and lower amortization of deferred charges related to prior year acquisitions. First quarter selling and administrative expenses of 29.2% of revenue were higher than the 28.8% in last year's fourth quarter, in part due to normal first quarter expenses as we began our fiscal year. 
Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter compared to 38.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $330 million at August 31, down $10 million from the $340 million in cash at May 31, primarily due to the share buyback of $71 million during the first quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $330 million at August 31 was $49 million of cash located outside of the U.S. 
Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since May 31. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at May 31. New goods inventory at August 31 was $242 million, down $9 million from May 31. Inventory continued to normalize during the quarter from higher post-SAP conversion levels. We're now seeing some efficiency gains from SAP. We do expect an increase in the remainder of the year due to the large rollouts in Uniform Direct Sales mentioned earlier. Accrued liabilities decreased to $43 million compared to May 31, primarily due to lower accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. We had $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt mature on June 1 and we refinanced that with a new issue of $250 million, 10-year debt on June 5, with a coupon of 3.25%. As of August 31, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $95 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $57 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's first quarter and an increase in accounts payable added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the first quarter was $47.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $32.1 million in Rental; $2.4 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.9 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions."

First off, it's the value of the program itself. We've talked a lot about that. The fact that you can get 5 changes each week of uniforms, no investment by the company or the employee in the uniforms and get them all taken care of for a relatively modest price is a phenomenal value. And I think that more and more companies continue to see that and that's why our business results, new business results, primarily the majority of it is the no programmer segment. I think the second reason is some of the product offerings that we have. We've talked a lot about our relationship with Carhartt. We continue to see very nice results in the FRC garment, the flame-resistant garment, especially in the energy sector, which is a growing sector in the U.S. economy. And then I'd say that next thing is in the Rental business, our Facility Services business, which is over 1/2 -- or which is about 1/2 of that total Rental segment. We continue to have very nice offerings for resolving some of the problems that companies face in such things as the floor care solutions, which includes the tile and carpet cleaning, the hygiene solutions, the restroom supplies and then the addition of the chemical cleaning systems that we have out there I think have all helped on that side of the business. So with all that said, I think our new business results continue to be good. Lost business continues to show some modest improvement year-over-year.

On the sales side, we believe that we have staffed appropriately for all of our businesses in order to grow those businesses and I think our new business results have been very good over the last couple of years, reflecting this high productivity level we're getting from the salesforce. We continue to increase appropriately in the correct markets the number of salespeople we have, but I don't think we're going to need to do a significant step up in that in order to get our growth.

First off, it will be -- we're pretty certain on the direct sale business, as Mike mentioned, that you're going to see an acceleration in that because we've got some large rollouts and that's in the plan and embedded in the guidance. But to get to the top end of the guidance, what I would say you would see is a better economy. Therefore, an improvement in the confidence level on the part of business owners to either add employees or to make discretionary spends. As we've talked, our catalog business was relatively flat. We think a lot of that is just caution on the part of the business owner. We could see getting to the top end of that range caused by the better-than-expected increase in paper prices than what we've embedded in there. And I would just say, employers just willing to add an employee here or there is going to have a positive impact on that. With all that said, I want to reiterate a point that Mike made and I try to make is, as you guys lay out your guidance, keep in mind this third quarter has these fewer number of workdays, and also I think the most difficult period we may have is right around the end of the calendar year. So our guidance anticipates that the fourth quarter should be pretty decent, third quarter is not going to be quite as good just because of all these other factors that are going on. But I'd say we have pretty good confidence in the guidance that we gave you and hopefully, we'll be able to achieve that top end of the things that I've mentioned earlier, happen."

And I'll tell you, last year's first quarter was a pretty good quarter. That 43.9% was a quarter we hadn't seen in the last 3 or in the previous couple.

So that added impact on it. We're just not seeing much growth at all in storage and therefore, that's one of the reasons we've always said that our preference is more on the treading side. The European businesses, we beat that quite a bit with the euro and with just the lack of growth over there. While it's only 1% of our overall company's revenue, it's a little bit bigger piece of the Document Management segment. And then I would say that in the shredding side, the focus has been selling good business. There has -- there were some aggressive companies out there in the business that we don't think are necessarily long-term committed to the business that were getting pretty aggressive in the fourth quarter last year and even into a little bit of the first quarter this year. But that seems to be stabilizing a bit because they're seeing the result of the lower paper prices and it's impacting their profit margins. We've got some nice customer rollouts in place, are going to be in place here in the next couple of quarters that are really good wins for us.

So one operation may have -- be able to put a lot more business and move it to a route without much margin impact than another operation. But generally, let me say this.  We have decided that it is necessary to have more route capacity in order to properly take care of our customers and to give our service providers incentive to continue to maintain their business, work with their customers, treat them in a way that Cintas wants to treat their customers. And so we think that while there might be a short-term margin impact in some operations, it will quickly be overcome by better lost business results and better improvement of growth with existing customers with other products and services."

After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reforms Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,060,000,000, which represents growth of 4% from last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income increased by 4.9% to $78 million; and earnings per diluted share were $0.63, a 10.5% increase over last year. 
Our operating income for the second quarter was $139 million or 13.1% of total second quarter revenue. The effects of Hurricane Sandy did have some adverse effect on our second quarter results, but the effect was not material. Our second quarter operating income included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of stock of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. 
The operating income was also negatively impacted by recycled paper prices. The average price for the second quarter was slightly over $150 per ton, representing a 32% decrease from last year's second quarter average price of just over $220 per ton. This year-over-year drop in paper prices resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter of $5.5 million. Keep in mind that this negative impact affects both revenue and operating income. We expect the second quarter recycled paper price to be $170 per ton, so the actual average second quarter price created a $1.5 million negative variance for the quarter versus our expectations. Mike will more details on the operating results by segment in a couple of minutes. 
Throughout our second quarter, our customers have continued to tell us -- that the economic uncertainty in the U.S. caused them to very cautious in spending, hiring and investment decision-making. Unknowns concerning U.S. tax policies and the impact of changing health care regulations have created a pause in many of their business activities. In addition to the feedback from our customers, we continue to see GDP forecast below 2% for calendar 2013. 
With these in mind, we are updating our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. We are not changing our earnings per diluted share guidance, which is an expectation of fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. We are bringing down our recycled paper price expectations for the remainder of the year to be approximately $160 per ton in the third quarter and $170 dollars per ton in the fourth quarter. And finally, this guidance incorporates the 1.9 million share buyback from our second quarter, but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the second quarter."

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.4%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.4%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 40.7%, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.2%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. 
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, we will have 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that the third quarter has 1 less workday than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms,  , towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue for the second quarter was $755.8 million, which is up 4.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.5%. 
As Bill mentioned, our customers continue to be affected by a business environment filled with uncertainties. And this showed in our second quarter net add stops, which was lower than each of the last 2 years. The pricing environment remains very competitive and the absence of rising energy and commodity prices made implementation of customer price increases very difficult. The productivity of our sales force though continued to be strong, and our lost business metric improved from last year. 
Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the second quarter, a 130 basis point decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 43.2%. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year's second quarter. As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during the quarter that totaled $1.6 million. This system represented new technology that did not provide the required operational improvements. In addition, material costs continued to rise as a percent of revenue due to garment injections associated with our new business. We have not been able to take advantage of our stockroom inventory due to the absence of any consistent customer hiring.  Finally, as we mentioned in our last call, we begin to expand our route capacity in the second quarter due to the new business and the number of new stops added over the past year.  The second quarter gross margin of 41.9% was lower than the 43.3% in this year's first quarter due to the garment processing system write-off, one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the cost of adding some route capacity. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Uniform direct sale revenue was $110.2 million, representing a decrease of 1.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Although our hospitality business continues to perform well, we saw weakening in our Fortune 1000 business. However, we expect that to change in the second half of the year due to several large rollouts scheduled to occur. 
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 27.4% for the second quarter, down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.6% and this year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. In addition, we did start incur some expenses associated with the scheduled rollouts just mentioned. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training in fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter. Revenue was $111.5 million, which is up 9.7% over last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.8%. Our first aid and safety business in particular continues to perform very well. 
This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the second quarter, which is down 70 basis points from the 43.1% in both last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a heavier mix of national account fire business in the second quarter compared to the other quarters, as well as the impact of some acquisition-related costs incurred during the quarter. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue was roughly flat compared to last year's second quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 1.8% compared to last year. As Bill mentioned, recycled paper prices had a negative $5.5 million impact on second quarter sales and gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. The average recycled paper price during the second quarter was roughly $150 per ton, which was down from last year's second quarter average of roughly $220 per ton and less than the first quarter average of roughly $170 per ton. This lower recycled paper price was one of the main drivers of the lower gross margin in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. In addition, energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year, and our shredding service labor was higher due to the addition of some route capacity in anticipation of several new national accounts.  Lastly, we also incurred some acquisition-related costs during the quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 27.6% as a percent of revenue in the second quarter. This is an improvement from last year's second quarter of 29.2%. As Bill mentioned, second quarter SG&A includes a gain on the sale of stock of an investment. Aside from this item, amortization of deferred charges relating the prior year acquisitions and medical expenses were both lower than last year. Second quarter SG&A of 27.6% of revenue was lower than the 29.2% in this year's first quarter due to the gain on the stock sale and lower payroll taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter compared to 35.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $276 million at November 30, down $54 million from the $330 million in cash and marketable securities at August 31, due to the share buyback of $81 million during the second quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $276 million at November 30 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S.  Accounts receivable increased by $20 million since August 31. We did experience some slowing of collection in the second quarter, but nothing that concerns us from an ultimate collection standpoint. 
New goods inventory at November 30 was $236 million down $6 million from August 31. We're pleased with our inventory performance since the implementation of SAP. Given the scheduled rollouts that will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, our new goods inventory levels will likely fluctuate in the next few quarters based on the specific timing of shipments to customers. 
Accrued liabilities increased $112 million compared to August 31 primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend, which was paid on December 12, and due to the increase in bond interest accrued. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion. As of November 30, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $132 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $119 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in new goods inventory contributed to the improvement in operating cash flow. CapEx for the second quarter was $51.6 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.2 million in rental; $1.6 million in uniform direct sales; $2.4 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $9.4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

However, over time, that gets eaten up and would really benefited if we could see some additional headcount at existing customers. We've been talking about that for the last couple of years.

If they are trying to protect the product from contamination from an employee regardless of it's temporary or permanent worker, they're going to have a uniform. So I would tell you that it all depends on what the buying motivate is for the customer on the uniforms side. To provide a uniform for temporary worker as a perk has not necessarily been the practice. But if we do go into a new world where many companies decide to have a lot of temporary workers as opposed to full-time workers in order to avoid potential costs, if they need that employee to be in a uniform or image or for protecting the product, I think you will see them use uniforms."

With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to  answer questions. The Private S",571,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us as we report our second quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to  answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,060,000,000, which represents growth of 4% from last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income increased by 4.9% to $78 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63, a 10.5% increase over last year. 
Our operating income for the second quarter was $139 million or 13.1% of total second quarter revenue. The effects of Hurricane Sandy did have some adverse effect on our second quarter results, but the effect was not material. Our second quarter operating income included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of stock of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. 
The operating income was also negatively impacted by recycled paper prices. The average price for the second quarter was slightly over $150 per ton, representing a 32% decrease from last year's second quarter average price of just over $220 per ton. This year-over-year drop in paper prices resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter of $5.5 million. Keep in mind that this negative impact affects both revenue and operating income. We expected the second quarter recycled paper price to be $170 per ton, so the actual average second quarter price created a $1.5 million negative variance for the quarter versus our expectations. Mike will give more details on the operating results by segment in a couple of minutes. 
Throughout our second quarter, our customers have continued to tell us the -- that the economic uncertainty in the U.S. caused them to be very cautious in spending, hiring and investment decision making. Unknowns concerning U.S. tax policies and the impact of changing health care regulations have created a pause in many of their business activities. In addition to this feedback from our customers, we continue to see GDP forecasts below 2% for calendar 2013. 
With this in mind, we are updating our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. We are not changing our earnings per diluted share guidance, which is an expectation of fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. We are bringing down our recycled paper price expectations for the remainder of the year to be approximately $160 per ton in the third quarter and $170 dollars per ton in the fourth quarter. And finally, this guidance incorporates the 1.9 million share buyback from our second quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the second quarter."
260725,225112102,399455,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2012",2012-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.4%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 40.7%, which is down from last year's second quarter gross",1522,"Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.4%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 40.7%, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.2%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. 
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, we will have 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that the third quarter has 1 less workday than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue for the second quarter was $755.8 million, which is up 4.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.5%. 
As Bill mentioned, our customers continue to be affected by a business environment filled with uncertainties. And this showed in our second quarter net add stops, which was lower than each of the last 2 years. The pricing environment remained very competitive, and the absence of rising energy and commodity prices made the implementation of customer price increases very difficult. The productivity of our sales force, though, continued to be strong, and our lost business metric improved from last year. 
Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the second quarter, a 130-basis-point decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 43.2%. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year's second quarter. 
As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during the quarter that totaled $1.6 million. This system represented new technology that did not provide the required operational improvements. In addition, material costs continued to rise as a percent of revenue due to garment injections associated with our new business. We have not been able to take advantage of our stockroom inventory due to the absence of any consistent customer hiring. Finally, as we mentioned in our last call, we began to expand our route capacity in the second quarter due to the new business and the number of new stops added over the past year. 
The second quarter gross margin of 41.9% was lower than the 43.3% in this year's first quarter due to the garment processing system write-off, one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the cost of adding some route capacity. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. 
Uniform direct sale revenue was $110.2 million, representing a decrease of 1.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Although our hospitality business continues to perform well, we saw weakening in our Fortune 1000 business. However, we expect that to change in the second half of the year due to several large rollouts scheduled to occur. 
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 27.4% for the second quarter, down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.6% and this year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. In addition, we did start to incur some expenses associated with the scheduled rollouts just mentioned. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter. Revenue was $111.5 million, which is up 9.7% over last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.8%. Our first aid and safety business in particular continues to perform very well. 
This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the second quarter, which is down 70 basis points from the 43.1% in both last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a heavier mix of National Account fire business in the second quarter compared to the other quarters, as well as the impact of some acquisition-related costs incurred during the quarter. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue was roughly flat compared to last year's second quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 1.8% compared to last year. As Bill mentioned, recycled paper prices had a negative $5.5 million impact on second quarter sales and gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. The average recycled paper price during the second quarter was roughly $150 per ton, which was down from last year's second quarter average of roughly $220 per ton and less than the first quarter average of roughly $170 per ton. This lower recycled paper price was one of the main drivers of the lower gross margin in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. In addition, energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year, and our shredding service labor was higher due to the addition of some route capacity in anticipation of several new national accounts. Lastly, we also incurred some acquisition-related costs during the quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses. SG&A was 27.6% as a percent of revenue in the second quarter. This is an improvement from last year's second quarter of 29.2%. As Bill mentioned, second quarter SG&A includes a gain on the sale of stock of an investment. Aside from this item, amortization of deferred charges relating to prior year acquisitions and medical expenses were both lower than last year.  Second quarter SG&A of 27.6% of revenue was lower than the 29.2% in this year's first quarter due to the gain on the stock sale and lower payroll taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for this -- for the quarter compared to 35.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $276 million at November 30, down $54 million from the $330 million in cash and marketable securities at August 31 due to the share buyback of $81 million during the second quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $276 million at November 30 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $20 million since August 31. We did experience some slowing of collections in the second quarter but nothing that concerns us from an ultimate collection standpoint. 
New goods inventory at November 30 was $236 million, down $6 million from August 31. We're pleased with our inventory performance since the implementation of SAP. Given the scheduled rollouts that will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, our new goods inventory level will likely fluctuate in the next few quarters based on the specific timing of shipments to customers. 
Accrued liabilities increased $112 million compared to August 31 primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend, which was paid on December 12, and due to an increase in bond interest accrued. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion. As of November 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $132 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $119 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in new goods inventory contributed to the improvement in operating cash flow. 
CapEx for the second quarter was $51.6 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.2 million in rental; $1.6 million in uniform direct sales; $2.4 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $9.4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

So as a result of that, new business is very competitive, and we have to be aggressive in obtaining new business. Additionally, as Mike mentioned in his comments, price increases on existing customers have been also somewhat difficult given the lack of any real increase in costs.

If they're trying to protect the product from contamination from an employee regardless of it's a temporary or permanent worker, they're going to have a uniform. So I would tell you that it all depends on what the buying motive is for the customer on the uniforms side. To provide a uniform for a temporary worker as a perk has not necessarily been the practice. But if we do go into a new world where many companies decide to have a lot of temporary workers as opposed to full-time workers in order to avoid potential costs, if they need that employee to be in a uniform or image or for protecting the product, I think you will see them use uniforms."

After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. 
The Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,060,000,000, which represents growth of 4% from last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income increased by 4.9% to $78 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63, a 10.5% increase over last year. 
Our operating income for the second quarter was $139 million or 13.1% of total second quarter revenue. The effects of Hurricane Sandy did have some adverse effect on our second quarter results, but the effect was not material. Our second quarter operating income included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of stock of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. 
The operating income was also negatively impacted by recycled paper prices. The average price for the second quarter was slightly over $150 per ton, representing a 32% decrease from last year's second quarter average price of just over $220 per ton. This year-over-year drop in paper prices resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter of $5.5 million. Keep in mind that this negative impact affects both revenue and operating income. We expected the second quarter recycled paper price to be $170 per ton, so the actual average second quarter price created a $1.5 million negative variance for the quarter versus our expectations. Mike will give more details on the operating results by segment in a couple minutes. 
Throughout our second quarter, our customers have continued to tell us the -- that the economic uncertainty in the U.S. caused them to be very cautious in spending, hiring and investment decision making. Unknowns concerning U.S. tax policies and the impact of changing health care regulations have created a pause in many of their business activities. In addition to this feedback from our customers, we continue to see GDP forecasts below 2% for calendar 2013. 
With these in mind, we are updating our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. We are not changing our earnings per diluted share guidance, which is an expectation of fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. We are bringing down our recycled paper price expectations for the remainder of the year to be approximately $160 per ton in the third quarter and $170 dollars per ton in the fourth quarter. And finally, this guidance incorporates the 1.9 million share buyback from our second quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the second quarter."
260725,225112102,399466,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2012",2012-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.4%.

As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.4%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 40.7%, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.2%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. 
Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, we will have 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that the third quarter has 1 less workday than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 
We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. 
The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue for the second quarter was $755.8 million, which is up 4.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.5%. 
As Bill mentioned, our customers continue to be affected by a business environment filled with uncertainties. And this showed in our second quarter net add stops, which was lower than each of the last 2 years. The pricing environment remained very competitive, and the absence of rising energy and commodity prices made the implementation of customer price increases very difficult. The productivity of our sales force, though, continued to be strong, and our lost business metric improved from last year. 
Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the second quarter, a 130-basis-point decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 43.2%. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year's second quarter. 
As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during the quarter that totaled $1.6 million. This system represented new technology that did not provide the required operational improvements. In addition, material costs continued to rise as a percent of revenue due to garment injections associated with our new business. We have not been able to take advantage of our stockroom inventory due to the absence of any consistent customer hiring. Finally, as we mentioned in our last call, we began to expand our route capacity in the second quarter due to the new business and the number of new stops added over the past year. 
The second quarter gross margin of 41.9% was lower than the 43.3% in this year's first quarter due to the garment processing system write-off, one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the cost of adding some route capacity. 
Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. 
Uniform direct sale revenue was $110.2 million, representing a decrease of 1.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Although our hospitality business continues to perform well, we saw weakening in our Fortune 1000 business. However, we expect that to change in the second half of the year due to several large rollouts scheduled to occur. 
Uniform direct sales gross margin was 27.4% for the second quarter, down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.6% and this year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. In addition, we did start to incur some expenses associated with the scheduled rollouts just mentioned. 
Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter. Revenue was $111.5 million, which is up 9.7% over last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.8%. Our first aid and safety business in particular continues to perform very well. 
This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the second quarter, which is down 70 basis points from the 43.1% in both last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a heavier mix of National Account fire business in the second quarter compared to the other quarters, as well as the impact of some acquisition-related costs incurred during the quarter. 
Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue was roughly flat compared to last year's second quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 1.8% compared to last year. As Bill mentioned, recycled paper prices had a negative $5.5 million impact on second quarter sales and gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. The average recycled paper price during the second quarter was roughly $150 per ton, which was down from last year's second quarter average of roughly $220 per ton and less than the first quarter average of roughly $170 per ton. This lower recycled paper price was one of the main drivers of the lower gross margin in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. In addition, energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year, and our shredding service labor was higher due to the addition of some route capacity in anticipation of several new national accounts. Lastly, we also incurred some acquisition-related costs during the quarter. 
Switching to selling and administrative expenses. SG&A was 27.6% as a percent of revenue in the second quarter. This is an improvement from last year's second quarter of 29.2%. As Bill mentioned, second quarter SG&A includes a gain on the sale of stock of an investment. Aside from this item, amortization of deferred charges relating to prior year acquisitions and medical expenses were both lower than last year. Second quarter SG&A of 27.6% of revenue was lower than the 29.2% in this year's first quarter due to the gain on the stock sale and lower payroll taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for this -- for the quarter compared to 35.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $276 million at November 30, down $54 million from the $330 million in cash and marketable securities at August 31 due to the share buyback of $81 million during the second quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $276 million at November 30 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $20 million since August 31. We did experience some slowing of collections in the second quarter but nothing that concerns us from an ultimate collection standpoint. 
New goods inventory at November 30 was $236 million, down $6 million from August 31. We're pleased with our inventory performance since the implementation of SAP. Given the scheduled rollouts that will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, our new goods inventory level will likely fluctuate in the next few quarters based on the specific timing of shipments to customers. 
Accrued liabilities increased $112 million compared to August 31 primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend, which was paid on December 12, and due to an increase in bond interest accrued. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion. As of November 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. 
Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $132 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $119 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in new goods inventory contributed to the improvement in operating cash flow. 
CapEx for the second quarter was $51.6 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.2 million in rental; $1.6 million in uniform direct sales; $2.4 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $9.4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions."

Additionally, as Mike mentioned in his comments, price increases on existing customers have been also somewhat difficult given the lack of any real increase in costs. The general low inflation rate has not enabled us to really be enabled to increase prices on existing accounts either to any great extent."

And so while we tried to efficiently add them, there comes point in time when you have more route capacity and therefore you have greater costs on a -- and not getting quite the efficiency. However, over time, that gets eaten up, and would really be benefited if we could see some additional headcount at existing customers. We've been talking about that for the last couple of years. But what we need to do is continue to invest in the routes to handle the new business, and then position ourselves to be able to handle growth in existing customers. So I think over time, it will come back and we will continue to -- we'll get back to improved margins.

So you just -- you have to go through and look at the different areas where jobs are being added. One of the analysts that follows Cintas recently put out a report, and he made the same comment. He said after you delve into the details, you begin to realize that any big increase in jobs did not have a positive impact on the uniform companies. So to answer the question, I think if you could see job growth in the 250,000-plus level, that you would expect that, that should start impacting our types of customers.
