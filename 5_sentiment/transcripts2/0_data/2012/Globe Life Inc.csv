Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.
While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.
Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact on the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first three quarter of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1345, down 33% for the year.
Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increase to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.
The volume of business form new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2000 per month, for January and February we have averaged closer to 6000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24000. Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31,",898,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.4 billion, including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities, $10.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $701 million compared to $863 million a year ago. The $162 million decline this year is due primarily to $140 million of dispositions and $22 million of net upgrades. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.4%, compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. With a portfolio of leverage at three times, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%, which is less than most of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $964 million compared to gains of $942 million at the end of the third quarter, and $108 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to slight declines in treasury yields and credit spreads. Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $273 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.22%, an average rating of A minus and an average life of 28 years. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 5.65% and an average rating of A minus.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.52% compared to 6.54% in the previous quarter and 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31, yield on the portfolio is 6.49%. Regarding RBC, as we have said before we plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last few years that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in the light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we haven’t finalized our 2011 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/11 will be around the 325% target. Now regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the fourth quarter we used $67 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $788 million to acquire 18.9 million shares or 16% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. At December 31, the parent company had liquid assets of $74 million. In addition to these assets the parents will generate additional free cash in 2012. We define annual free cash flow as a dividend received from the subsidiaries less interest expense and less the dividends paid to our shareholders.
Assuming shareholder dividends at the current level, we expect free cash flow in 2012 to be around $350 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $74 million of assets on hand, we will have approximately $425 million to $435 million of cash available to the parent during the year. To date in 2012, we have used $16 million of this cash to buy 355,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If marketing conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. As of January 1,2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will now be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows, or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard has been in place from prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be around 16% of the current DAC assets, which will result in around a 10% reduction in GAAP equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturities. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules. And that ROE, excluding net unrealized gains or losses, will rise from the current 14% level to 15%, to 16%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012.
Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark.

Well, first off, Jimmy, on as far as American Income recruiting -- and I’m not sure if it was the way the holidays fell, we did see a drop off the last couple of weeks of the year which caused a little dip there. The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it’s at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we’re up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.
So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it’s going to take six months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we’ll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully a turnaround from there. But I really think it will be the second half of the year before we really see the results of the turnaround at Liberty. Gary?

From that we used $68 million for share repurchases and we also used $25,000 to make a capital contribution to one of our insurance subsidiaries. And then that leaves another $12 million that was a net of several different parent company expenses. But if you net all those down, you get down to the $74 million.

And we expect a large number of those to be called but up until recently, with the expectation that those calls would occur in 2013. But as you mentioned there is talk that some of the banks are instead avoiding for the change and that was tied to the change in the Tier 1 capital rules, but now there is some indications that some banks will say, well, when these rules are issued in 2012 that will be the triggering event that’ll allow them to call the securities.
So, we really don’t know how that’s going to work out, whether there will be sizable amount in 2012 or it will be 2013. You’re right, it will have an impact on our yield. The yields on those are just little over 7%. And if we refinance or reinvest at 4.75%, it would be a significant change to the yield. In the last call, we talked about, if we invested in rates at 4.75% for the next five years, what would happen to the portfolio yield and I think what we said at five years from now and so yield of 6.49% as it does today, the portfolio would be yielding 6%. Well in that, in those projections, we assume that these trust preferreds would be called and that the money would be reinvested at 4.75%. So, that projection is still good, the question is though, if it will, some of them happen in 2012 and we just don’t know.

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4,381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.
While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4,600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.
Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact of the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first 3 quarters of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1,345, down 33% for the year.
Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increased to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.
The volume of business for new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2,000 per month, for January and February, we have averaged closer to 6,000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75,000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24,000. 
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."
308916,153985461,218059,"Torchmark Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2",894,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. 
First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.4 billion, including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities, $10.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $701 million compared to $863 million a year ago. The $162 million decline this year is due primarily to $140 million of dispositions and $22 million of net upgrades. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.4%, compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. With a portfolio leverage of 3x, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%, which is less than most of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB plus a year ago. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $964 million compared to gains of $942 million at the end of the third quarter, and $108 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to slight declines in treasury yields and credit spreads. Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $273 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.22%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 28 years. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 5.65% and an average rating of A-.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.52% compared to 6.54% in the previous quarter and 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31, yield on the portfolio is 6.49%. Regarding RBC, as we have said before we plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last few years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in the light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we haven’t finalized our 2011 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/11 will be around the 325% target. Now regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the fourth quarter we used $67 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $788 million to acquire 18.9 million shares or 16% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. At December 31, the parent company had liquid assets of $74 million. In addition to these assets the parents will generate additional free cash in 2012. We define annual free cash flow as the dividends received from the subsidiaries, less interest expense and less the dividends paid to our shareholders.
Assuming shareholder dividends at the current level, we expect free cash flow in 2012 to be around $350 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $74 million of assets on hand, we will have approximately $425 million to $435 million of cash available to the parent during the year. To date in 2012, we have used $16 million of this cash to buy 355,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If marketing conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. As of January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will now be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows, or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard has been in place from prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be around 16% of the current DAC assets, which will result in around a 10% reduction in GAAP equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturities. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules. And that ROE, excluding net unrealized gains or losses, will rise from the current 14% level to 15%, to 16%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012.
Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark."

The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it’s at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we’re up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.
So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it’s going to take 6 months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we’ll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully turnaround from there. But I really think it will be the second half of the year before we really see the results of the turnaround at Liberty. Gary?"

But as you mentioned there is talk that some of the banks are instead waiting [ph] for the change and that was tied to the change in the Tier 1 capital rules, but now there is some indication that some banks will say, well, when these rules are issued in 2012 that will be the triggering event that’ll allow them to call the securities.
So, we really don’t know how that’s going to work out, whether there will be sizable amount in 2012 or it will be 2013. You’re right, it will have an impact on our yield. The yields on those are just little over 7%. And if we refinance or reinvest at 4.75%, it would be a significant change to the yield. In the last call, we talked about, if we invested in rates at 4.75% for the next 5 years, what would happen to the portfolio yield and I think what we said at 5 years from now, it's a yield of 6.49% as it does today, the portfolio would be yielding 6%. Well in that, in those projections, we assume that these trust preferreds would be called and that the money would be reinvested at 4.75%.

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4,381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.
While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4,600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.
Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact of the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first 3 quarters of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1,345, down 33% for the year.
Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increased to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.
The volume of business for new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2,000 per month, for January and February, we have averaged closer to 6,000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75,000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24,000. 
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."

The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it’s at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we’re up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.
So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it’s going to take 6 months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we’ll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully turnaround from there.

Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.Some of our comments or answers to your questions may co",794,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the first quarter was $128 million or $1.27 per share, a per share increase of 22% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $119 million or $1.17 per share, a 39% increase on a per share basis.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 15.8% for the quarter and our book value per share was $32.70, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity carried at market value, book value per share grew 24% to $38.19. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $452 million, and life underwriting margins increased 13% to $126 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $88 million.
At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $161 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $52 million. Net life sales increased 17% for the quarter to $39 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 5,104, up 26% from a year ago and up 17% during the quarter.
The first quarter results at American Income far exceeded our expectations. The number of newly hired agents that produced business in the first quarter was up 52% from a year ago. The number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of agent retention, was up 76% in the quarter. Our middle management ranks grew by 12% in the quarter and are up 29% from a year ago. Every key factor indicates that 2012 is a stellar year for American Income.
In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $161 million and life underwriting margin grew 10% to $38 million. Net life sales were up 9% to $39 million. I am pleased with the results in direct response. While high gas prices and difficult economy continued to impact our response rates, through continuing innovation we've been able to grow our sales and maintain our margins.
I would also remind everyone of the change we made in our direct response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins, it resulted in a 6% reduction in our net sales due to more applications being rejected for health reasons. Life premium at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million, while life underwriting margin was up 21% to $18 million.
Net life sales declined 22% to $7 million, while net health sales grew 16% to $3 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,276, down 31% from a year ago and down 5% for the quarter. The underwriting margins at Liberty National had benefitted from the change in DAC accounting due to the significant reductions we have implemented in our non-deferrable acquisition cost over the last couple of years.
I'm also very pleased with the progress being made in turning around our declines in producing agents and sales. In mid-February, the agent count at Liberty National hit its low point of 1,228. Since that time, we have seen consistent growth, and as of Monday, the producing agent count has grown to 1,321, which is up 7.5% in the past two months. I'm very optimistic that this agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales at Liberty National for the balance of this year.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $181 million, and health underwriting margin declined 10% to $40 million. Health net sales grew 5% to $15 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 50% to $74 million while the underwriting margin increased 54% to $8 million.
Part D sales for the quarter jumped 235% to $25 million. The new low income subsidized enroll leads continue to exceed our prior estimates and we have raised our Part D revenue estimates for 2012 to $319 million versus $197 million for 2011.
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, which were up 8% from a year ago, but in line with our expectations. Roughly half of this increase was caused by the elimination of the administrative fee which we were receiving on the United Investors business. The balance of the increase was due to increased cost in our Part D administration and conservation program.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman for his comments.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31, 2012. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets were $11.6 billion, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. There is no exposure to the European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities $10.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $723 million compared to $758 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.5% compared to 7.2% a year ago and with the portfolio leverage of three times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 22%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio $873 million compared to $156 million a year ago. Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter we invested $232 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.76%, an average rating of A minus, and an average life of 30 years.
The new money yield of 4.76% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 5.22% yield in the fourth quarter. For this reason we have lowered the GAAP discount rate used to calculate the reserves and DAC for policies issued in 2012 to 4.75%, graded to 6.5% over seven years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.47% compared to 6.52% in the previous quarter and 6.62% in the first quarter of 2011. The continued decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31, the yield on the portfolio is 6.46%.
Now turning to RBC we plan to maintain our capital at a level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets in the first quarter we spent $90 million to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April we have used $36 million to buy another 750,000 shares. So for the full through today we have spent a $126 million of parent company cash to acquire 2.6 million shares. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations as we've said before, free cash flow results from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on the debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
Assuming shareholders dividends at the current level, we expect to generate approximately $347 million of free cash flow for the entire year. This is less than the $350 million to $360 million projected in the previous call because we increased the dividend rate on Torchmark stock. Effective with the dividend paid in the second quarter, the dividend rate increased from $0.12 to $0.15 a share, which will result in 2012 dividends of approximately $56 million, $8 million more than they would have been.
In spite of the dividend increase, the 2012 free cash flow plus the $74 million of cash on-hand at the beginning of the year will provide a total of $421 million of available cash for the full year. As of today, after deducting the $126 million of year-to-date share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $295 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. On January 1st the Company adopted ASU 2010-26, which changed the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition cost. This standard changes the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred under the previous rules will no longer be deferred. However it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We adopted the new rule retrospectively, which means that DAC was written down to a level as if the new student had been in place in prior periods. The earnings impact of the new rule, is a combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down.
The financial statement impact of the new rules is consistent with the estimates that we discussed on the last call. First, compared to the comparable balances at March 31, 2011 the retroactive write-down was 16% of the DAC asset, resulting in a 10% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding the net unrealized gains on fixed maturities.
In addition the earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were 1.2% or $0.016 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules and ROE excluding net unrealized gains was 15.8%, compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the old rules. All prior periods on the net operating summary and the balance sheet had been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of ASU 2010-26.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

I have the utmost confidence in both Larry and Gary, and have worked closely with both of them for over 25 years. I believe that either one of them would be an outstanding CEO on their own, but I also believe that together they will be better than either would be individually.

As far as Liberty National, yes, the margins have improved. I would expect they will stay at about the same level, at least for the balance of this year, Jimmy, somewhere in that 24% to 25% range. That’s what we have assumed in our guidance.

Right now it is just the weighted average rate because of all of the many years of issue that we have out there is higher than what we are for the current year issues.

There is still some uncertainty there. So, I don't think we've being overly optimistic but as far as Liberty National, again I think we'll see sequential growth going forward but if I look back at last year, I feel confident that we'll have grown by the fourth quarter and sales year-over-year, I would expect the third quarter will be close to flat, but if I look a year from now, when we're comparing to the first quarter this year, I expect to see strong double-digit growth in sales a year from now at Liberty.

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the first quarter was $128 million or $1.27 per share, a per share increase of 22% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $119 million or $1.17 per share, a 39% increase on a per share basis.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 15.8% for the quarter and our book value per share was $32.70, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity carried at market value, book value per share grew 24% to $38.19. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $452 million, and life underwriting margins increased 13% to $126 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $88 million.
At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $161 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $52 million. Net life sales increased 17% for the quarter to $39 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 5,104, up 26% from a year ago and up 17% during the quarter.
The first quarter results at American Income far exceeded our expectations. The number of newly hired agents that produced business in the first quarter was up 52% from a year ago. The number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of agent retention, was up 76% in the quarter. Our middle management ranks grew by 12% in the quarter and are up 29% from a year ago. Every key factor indicates that 2012 is a stellar year for American Income.
In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $161 million and life underwriting margin grew 10% to $38 million. Net life sales were up 9% to $39 million. I am pleased with the results in direct response. While high gas prices and difficult economy continued to impact our response rates, through continuing innovation we've been able to grow our sales and maintain our margins.
I would also remind everyone of the change we made in our direct response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins, it resulted in a 6% reduction in our net sales due to more applications being rejected for health reasons. Life premium at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million, while life underwriting margin was up 21% to $18 million.
Net life sales declined 22% to $7 million, while net health sales grew 16% to $3 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,276, down 31% from a year ago and down 5% for the quarter. The underwriting margins at Liberty National had benefitted from the change in DAC accounting due to the significant reductions we have implemented in our non-deferrable acquisition cost over the last couple of years.
I'm also very pleased with the progress being made in turning around our declines in producing agents and sales. In mid-February, the agent count at Liberty National hit its low point of 1,228. Since that time, we have seen consistent growth, and as of Monday, the producing agent count has grown to 1,321, which is up 7.5% in the past 2 months. I'm very optimistic that this agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales at Liberty National for the balance of this year.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $181 million, and health underwriting margin declined 10% to $40 million. Health net sales grew 5% to $15 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 50% to $74 million while the underwriting margin increased 54% to $8 million.
Part D sales for the quarter jumped 235% to $25 million. The new low income subsidized enroll leads continue to exceed our prior estimates and we have raised our Part D revenue estimates for 2012 to $319 million versus $197 million for 2011.
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, which were up 8% from a year ago, but in line with our expectations. Roughly half of this increase was caused by the elimination of the administrative fee which we were receiving on the United Investors business. The balance of the increase was due to increased cost in our Part D administration and conservation program.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman for his comments."

The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.5% compared to 7.2% a year ago and with the portfolio leverage of 3 times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 22%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $873 million compared to $156 million a year ago. Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter we invested $232 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.76%, an average rating of A minus, and an average life of 30 years.
The new money yield of 4.76% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 5.22% yield in the fourth quarter. For this reason, we have lowered the GAAP discount rate used to calculate the reserves and DAC for policies issued in 2012 to 4.75%, graded to 6.5% over 7 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.47% compared to 6.52% in the previous quarter and 6.62% in the first quarter of 2011. The continued decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31, the yield on the portfolio is 6.46%.
Now turning to RBC. We plan to maintain our capital at a level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the first quarter, we spent $90 million to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April we have used $36 million to buy another 750,000 shares. So for the full year through today we have spent a $126 million of parent company cash to acquire 2.6 million shares. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations as we've said before, free cash flow results from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on the debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
Assuming shareholders dividends at the current level, we expect to generate approximately $347 million of free cash flow for the entire year. This is less than the $350 million to $360 million projected in the previous call because we increased the dividend rate on Torchmark stock. Effective with the dividend paid in the second quarter, the dividend rate increased from $0.12 to $0.15 a share, which will result in 2012 dividends of approximately $56 million, $8 million more than they would have been.
In spite of the dividend increase, the 2012 free cash flow plus the $74 million of cash on-hand at the beginning of the year will provide a total of $421 million of available cash for the full year. As of today, after deducting the $126 million of year-to-date share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $295 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. On January 1, the Company adopted ASU 2010-26, which changed the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition cost. This standard changes the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred under the previous rules will no longer be deferred. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We adopted the new rule retrospectively, which means that DAC was written down to a level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods. The earnings impact of the new rule is a combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down.
The financial statement impact of the new rules is consistent with the estimates that we discussed on the last call. First, compared to the comparable balances at December 31, 2011 the retroactive write-down was 16% of the DAC asset, resulting in a 10% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding the net unrealized gains on fixed maturities.
In addition the earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were 1.2% or $0.016 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules and ROE excluding net unrealized gains was 15.8%, compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the old rules. All prior periods on the net operating summary and the balance sheet had been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of ASU 2010-26.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark."

This is simply the discount rate we used to calculate the reserves with the DAC. And although we’ve lowered the discount rate used last year, you got to remember that discount rate that we set each year applies only to policies issued in that year.
So even though we're at 4.75% now in 2012 issues, over 90% of our reserves are for policies issued prior to 2011, and during that period of time we were using a discount rate somewhere, at times 6% and at times as high as 7%, so between the 6% and 7%.
So when you rate all those issue years together that’s where you get to a little under 6% and over time, I think actually you will see that rate go up just slightly and it is going to level off, and then as I mentioned earlier, if we continue at 4.75%, then several years from now, you will see that trending down toward the 4.75%.

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the first quarter was $128 million or $1.27 per share, a per share increase of 22% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $119 million or $1.17 per share, a 39% increase on a per share basis.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 15.8% for the quarter and our book value per share was $32.70, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity carried at market value, book value per share grew 24% to $38.19. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $452 million, and life underwriting margins increased 13% to $126 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $88 million.
At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $161 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $52 million. Net life sales increased 17% for the quarter to $39 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 5,104, up 26% from a year ago and up 17% during the quarter.
The first quarter results at American Income far exceeded our expectations. The number of newly hired agents that produced business in the first quarter was up 52% from a year ago. The number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of agent retention, was up 76% in the quarter. Our middle management ranks grew by 12% in the quarter and are up 29% from a year ago. Every key factor indicates that 2012 is a stellar year for American Income.
In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $161 million and life underwriting margin grew 10% to $38 million. Net life sales were up 9% to $39 million. I am pleased with the results in direct response. While high gas prices and difficult economy continued to impact our response rates, through continuing innovation we've been able to grow our sales and maintain our margins.
I would also remind everyone of the change we made in our direct response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins, it resulted in a 6% reduction in our net sales due to more applications being rejected for health reasons. Life premium at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million, while life underwriting margin was up 21% to $18 million.
Net life sales declined 22% to $7 million, while net health sales grew 16% to $3 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,276, down 31% from a year ago and down 5% for the quarter. The underwriting margins at Liberty National had benefitted from the change in DAC accounting due to the significant reductions we have implemented in our non-deferrable acquisition cost over the last couple of years.
I'm also very pleased with the progress being made in turning around our declines in producing agents and sales. In mid-February, the agent count at Liberty National hit its low point of 1,228. Since that time, we have seen consistent growth, and as of Monday, the producing agent count has grown to 1,321, which is up 7.5% in the past 2 months. I'm very optimistic that this agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales at Liberty National for the balance of this year.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $181 million, and health underwriting margin declined 10% to $40 million. Health net sales grew 5% to $15 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 50% to $74 million while the underwriting margin increased 54% to $8 million.
Part D sales for the quarter jumped 235% to $25 million. The new low income subsidized enroll leads continue to exceed our prior estimates and we have raised our Part D revenue estimates for 2012 to $319 million versus $197 million for 2011.
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, which were up 8% from a year ago, but in line with our expectations. Roughly half of this increase was caused by the elimination of the administrative fee which we were receiving on the United Investors business. The balance of the increase was due to increased cost in our Part D administration and conservation program.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman for his comments."

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31, 2012. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets were $11.6 billion, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. There is no exposure to the European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities, $10.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $723 million compared to $758 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.5% compared to 7.2% a year ago and with the portfolio leverage of 3 times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 22%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $873 million compared to $156 million a year ago. Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter we invested $232 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.76%, an average rating of A minus, and an average life of 30 years.
The new money yield of 4.76% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 5.22% yield in the fourth quarter. For this reason, we have lowered the GAAP discount rate used to calculate the reserves and DAC for policies issued in 2012 to 4.75%, graded to 6.5% over 7 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.47% compared to 6.52% in the previous quarter and 6.62% in the first quarter of 2011. The continued decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31, the yield on the portfolio is 6.46%.
Now turning to RBC. We plan to maintain our capital at a level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the first quarter, we spent $90 million to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April we have used $36 million to buy another 750,000 shares. So for the full year through today we have spent a $126 million of parent company cash to acquire 2.6 million shares. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations as we've said before, free cash flow results from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on the debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.
Assuming shareholders dividends at the current level, we expect to generate approximately $347 million of free cash flow for the entire year. This is less than the $350 million to $360 million projected in the previous call because we increased the dividend rate on Torchmark stock. Effective with the dividend paid in the second quarter, the dividend rate increased from $0.12 to $0.15 a share, which will result in 2012 dividends of approximately $56 million, $8 million more than they would have been.
In spite of the dividend increase, the 2012 free cash flow plus the $74 million of cash on-hand at the beginning of the year will provide a total of $421 million of available cash for the full year. As of today, after deducting the $126 million of year-to-date share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $295 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. On January 1, the Company adopted ASU 2010-26, which changed the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition cost. This standard changes the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred under the previous rules will no longer be deferred. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We adopted the new rule retrospectively, which means that DAC was written down to a level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods. The earnings impact of the new rule is a combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down.
The financial statement impact of the new rules is consistent with the estimates that we discussed on the last call. First, compared to the comparable balances at December 31, 2011 the retroactive write-down was 16% of the DAC asset, resulting in a 10% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding the net unrealized gains on fixed maturities.
In addition the earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were 1.2% or $0.016 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules and ROE excluding net unrealized gains was 15.8%, compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the old rules. All prior periods on the net operating summary and the balance sheet had been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of ASU 2010-26.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark."

So I don't think we've being overly optimistic but as far as Liberty National, again I think we'll see sequential growth going forward but if I look back at last year, I feel confident that we'll have growth by the fourth quarter and sales year-over-year, I would expect the third quarter will be close to flat, but if I look a year from now, when we're comparing to the first quarter this year, I expect to see strong double-digit growth in sales a year from now at Liberty."

We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and we are excited about the company's future prospects. We are seeing growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieve our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of the agent retention. The first top bonus owners were up 60% in the second quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 21% in the second quarter. We expect sales growth for remainder of the year to range from 12% to 15%.
Our Direct Response operation, Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $58 million and life underwriting margin declined 1% to $35 million. The decline in margin was due to unusual claim fluctuations and we expect that the loss ratios will return to previous levels for the remainder of the year. Net life sales were up 4% to $38 million. We are also pleased with the results in Direct Response, despite a difficult economy, we have been able to grow our sales.
We would also remind everyone of the change we initiated in our Direct Response underwriting in mid-2011. On improving our margins resulted in a reduction of our net sales due to more applications been rejected for health reasons, set sales growth through the remainder of the year to be around mid-single digit range.
Liberty National segment declined 2% to $71 million. Our life underwriting was up 21% to $18 million. Net life sales declined 18% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 12% to $4 million. However, health sales increased 9% in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,355, down 24% from a year ago, but up 6% for the quarter. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in turning around our declines and producing agents and sales.
We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales of Liberty National for the balance of the year. Premium revenue from Part D grew 60% to $78 million and the underwriting margin increased 47% to $8 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 915% to $22 million due to the increase in low income subsidized enrollees for 2012.

With a portfolio of leverage of three times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 24%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly the under the A- of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion compared to $873 million in the first quarter, and $156 million a year ago.
Now, regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $197 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective of 4.49% and averaging rating of BBB plus at an average life of 27 years.
For the year, we have invested $430 million at an average rating of A-. The new money yield of 4.49% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011, and the 4.76% yield in the first quarter of this year.
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.43%, compared to 6.47% in the previous quarter and 6.6% in the second quarter 2011. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money rates. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.42%.
On July 5, the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the 2013 changes to the capital rules for banks, were issued. Subsequently we were notified that 301 million of our $708 million of bank hybrid trust preferred securities will be called in July and August. These securities have an average yield rate at 7.18%, and assuming the call proceeds are re-invested at 4.25%, the loss to annual income will be $9 million pre-tax, or $6 million after-tax. For 2012, the loss to income will be approximately $3 million after-tax and the portfolio yield will be reduced by about 8 basis points. This amount was accounted for in our guidance.
The remaining bank hybrids, we anticipate that another $300 million could be called. We don't know whether any of them will be called in the last half of 2012, but I expect the most of them to be called by end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35%, and assuming the same 4.25% investment rate, the loss to renewal income if all of those securities are called, it will be a similar $6 million after-tax.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest grades continues to be the impact on earnings, not on the balance sheet.
We maintain our underwriting margins, we write a new business premium rates on the majority of American Income's life products and the Direct Response juvenile products by 5% at January 1 of this year. These increases provided additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies and we did so without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years, and that assumes recall of the $600 million of hybrid preferreds.
Last fall, we performed a stress test to determine the impact on the portfolio yield of investing all new money in at 4.75% over the next five years. Under that scenario, we determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016, would be between 5.95% and 6.10%. We have rerun the model this time using a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be around 5.75% to 5.85%.
At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. Even though we don't believe our new money rate will be as low as 4.25% for the next five years, should that happen, we would still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended lower interest rate environment impact to income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off the (Inaudible) stood up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.
In addition, we'll not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share purchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In second quarter, we spent $184 million to buy 3.9 million Torchmark shares at an average of $4",596,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share purchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In second quarter, we spent $184 million to buy 3.9 million Torchmark shares at an average of $47.42.
Going into the second quarter, we had anticipated spending price $90 million, which we did to acquire 1.9 million shares at an average cost of $48.54 per share. However due to favorable market conditions, we made the decision to acquire an additional 2 million shares during the quarter.
These additional shares were acquired for total cost of $94 million, an average of $46.39 per share this was less than a $48.54 per share paid to purchase the initial 1.9 million. For the full year through June 30, we had spent 274 million of parent company cash to acquire $5.8 million shares at an average price of $47.53.
The available liquid assets as a parent consist of assets on hand and they and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
We expect to generate approximately $350 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus, the total liquid assets available for all of 2012 will be around $424 million. During the first six months of the year, we generated about $163 million of free cash flow but spent $274 million tor Torchmark share repurchases, purchasing 5.8 million Torchmark shares. The repurchases were funded by $179 million from the cash on hand and $95 million from the issuance of additional commercial paper.
As a result of this activity, the parent ended the second quarter with $58 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets, plus $163 million of free cash flow, less $179 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $58 million on hand at the end of the second quarter, we should generate approximately $184 million of free cash flow in the next two quarters giving us $242 million of total cash available for the remainder of the year. $95 million of this cash will be used to reduce our commercial paper to its normal level, leaving us with approximately $147 million of liquid assets available between now and the end of the year.
It should be noted that we have already reduced the commercial paper outstanding by approximately 9o million since June 30. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain a minimum of $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now regarding the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but it's sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relative lower risk of our policy liabilities and our current ratings.
At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of the amount required for the targeted 325% ratio. Those were my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.

As we talked about this in previous analyst calls the reason these bonds are being called is there is a provision in those bond that they can be called if there is a change in the capital rules, and they lose their capital status. Of course under Dodd-Frank those rules are going to be changed and those rules will be effective in 2013. So all along, we felt that the $600 million source of bond would probably be called and that they would be called in 2013.

That's reflected in those numbers, where we're seeing more of the first time agents chip bonus, we are seeing middle management grow.

The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,318, up 23% from a year ago and up 4% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and we are excited about the company's future prospects. We are seeing growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieve our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of the agent retention. The first top bonus owners were up 60% in the second quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 21% in the second quarter. We expect sales growth for remainder of the year to range from 12% to 15%.
Our Direct Response operation, Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $58 million and life underwriting margin declined 1% to $35 million. The decline in margin was due to unusual claim fluctuations and we expect that the loss ratios will return to previous levels for the remainder of the year. Net life sales were up 4% to $38 million. We are also pleased with the results in Direct Response, despite a difficult economy, we have been able to grow our sales.
We would also remind everyone of the change we initiated in our Direct Response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins resulted in a reduction of our net sales due to more applications been rejected for health reasons, set sales growth through the remainder of the year to be around mid-single digit range.
Liberty National segment declined 2% to $71 million. Our life underwriting was up 21% to $18 million. Net life sales declined 18% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 12% to $4 million. However, health sales increased 9% in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,355, down 24% from a year ago, but up 6% for the quarter. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in turning around our declines and producing agents and sales.
We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales of Liberty National for the balance of the year. Premium revenue from Part D grew 60% to $78 million and the underwriting margin increased 47% to $8 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 915% to $22 million due to the increase in low income subsidized enrollees for 2012.

On our website are 3",924,"To complete, insurance operations administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, 1% less than a year ago quarter and in line with our expectations.
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2012. As indicated on the schedule, invested assets were $11.6 billion, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.
There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. Of the fixed maturities, $10.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $764 million, compared to $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities of 6.9%, compared to 6.7% a year ago.
With a portfolio of leverage of 3x, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 24%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly the under the A- of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion compared to $873 million in the first quarter, and $156 million a year ago.
Now, regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $197 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.49% , an average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 27 years.
For the year, we have invested $430 million at an average rating of A-. The new money yield of 4.49% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011, and the 4.76% yield in the first quarter of this year.
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.43%, compared to 6.47% in the previous quarter and 6.56% in the second quarter 2011. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money rates. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.42%.
On July 5, the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the 2013 changes to the capital rules for banks, were issued. Subsequently we were notified that $301 million of our $708 million of bank hybrid trust preferred securities will be called in July and August. These securities have an average yield rate at 7.18%, and assuming the call proceeds are re-invested at 4.25%, the loss to annual income will be $9 million pre-tax, or $6 million after-tax. For 2012, the loss to income will be approximately $3 million after-tax and the portfolio yield will be reduced by about 8 basis points. This amount was accounted for in our guidance.
The remaining bank hybrids, we anticipate that another $300 million could be called. We don't know whether any of them will be called in the last half of 2012, but I expect the most of them to be called by end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35%, and assuming the same 4.25% investment rate, the lost annual income if all of those securities are called, will be a similar $6 million after-tax.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates continues to be the impact on earnings, not on the balance sheet.
To maintain our underwriting margins, we rasied the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income's life products and the Direct Response funeral products by 5% at January 1 of this year. These increases provided additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies and we did so without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years, and that assumes a call of the $600 million of hybrid preferreds.
Last fall, we performed a stress test to determine the impact on the portfolio yield of investing all new money in at 4.75% over the next 5 years. Under that scenario, we determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016, would be between 5.95% and 6.10%. We have rerun the model this time using a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be around 5.75% to 5.85%.
At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. Even though we don't believe our new money rate will be as low as 4.25% for the next 5 years, should that happen, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended lower interest rate environment impact to income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off  DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital."

First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In second quarter, we spent $184 million to buy 3.9 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $47.42.
Going into the second quarter, we had anticipated spending price $90 million, which we did to acquire 1.9 million shares at an average cost of $48.54 per share. However due to favorable market conditions, we made the decision to acquire an additional 2 million shares during the quarter.
These additional shares were acquired for total cost of $94 million, an average cost of $46.39 per share this was less than a $48.54 per share paid to purchase the initial 1.9 million. For the full year through June 30, we had spent $274 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.8 million shares at an average price of $47.53.
The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
We expect to generate approximately $350 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus, the total liquid assets available for all of 2012 will be around $424 million. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated about $163 million of free cash flow but spent $274 million for Torchmark share repurchases, purchasing 5.8 million Torchmark shares. The repurchases were funded by $179 million from the cash on hand and $95 million from the issuance of additional commercial paper.
As a result of this activity, the parent ended the second quarter with $58 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets, plus $163 million of free cash flow, less $179 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $58 million on hand at the end of the second quarter, we should generate approximately $184 million of free cash flow in the next 2 quarters giving us $242 million of total cash available for the remainder of the year. $95 million of this cash will be used to reduce our commercial paper to its normal level, leaving us with approximately $147 million of liquid assets available between now and the end of the year.
It should be noted that we have already reduced the commercial paper outstanding by approximately $90 million since June 30. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain a minimum of $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now regarding the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but it's sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relative lower risk of our policy liabilities and our current ratings.
At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of the amount required for the targeted 325% ratio. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

You got to $3 million after-tax impact for the remainder of the calendar year which is about $0.03, so trying to bridge a little between that amount and what seems to be maybe by some interpretation of bigger move in the guidance.
Is there another piece here, which is that you may suffer a period, where the funds are simply not deployed? We need to factor that in, or how should we think about it?"

The remaining $408 million, there's a $107 million that are either not callable or they there may call, calls and we're not expecting those to be called. That leaves another $301 million that could be called, and based on where their rates are, we feel they probably will be called.
As we talked about this in previous analyst calls the reason these bonds are being called is there is a provision in those bonds that they can be called if there is a change in the capital rules, and they lose their capital status. Of course under Dodd-Frank those rules are going to be changed and those rules will be effective in 2013. So all along, we felt that the $600 million sort of the bond swould probably be called and that they would be called in 2013.
Early in the year, we read where some banks were looking at the fact, whenever the rules are published, which is expected to be in 2012, that, that would be the triggering event, not the actual implementation of the rules in 2013. That’s what has happened here, with these the $300 million, those banks are considering a triggering event happening when those rules are or at least the notice of the rule making was issued in July. So what we don't know is of the other $300 million that are potential calls.  We don't know whether the banks will determine 2012 as a trigger year or whether later 2013. We'll just have to wait and see what they do."

The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,318, up 23% from a year ago and up 4% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and we are excited about the company's future prospects. We are seeing growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieve our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of the agent retention. The first top bonus owners were up 60% in the second quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 21% in the second quarter. We expect sales growth for remainder of the year to range from 12% to 15%.
Our Direct Response operation, Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $58 million and life underwriting margin declined 1% to $35 million. The decline in margin was due to unusual claim fluctuations and we expect that the loss ratios will return to previous levels for the remainder of the year. Net life sales were up 4% to $38 million. We are also pleased with the results in Direct Response, despite a difficult economy, we have been able to grow our sales.
We would also remind everyone of the change we initiated in our Direct Response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins resulted in a reduction of our net sales due to more applications been rejected for health reasons, set sales growth through the remainder of the year to be around mid-single digit range.
Liberty National segment declined 2% to $71 million. Our life underwriting was up 21% to $18 million. Net life sales declined 18% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 12% to $4 million. However, health sales increased 9% in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,355, down 24% from a year ago, but up 6% for the quarter. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in turning around our declines and producing agents and sales.
We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales of Liberty National for the balance of the year. Premium revenue from Part D grew 60% to $78 million and the underwriting margin increased 47% to $8 million.

308916,214273277,334117,"Torchmark Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","To complete, insurance operations administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, 1% less than a year ago quarter and in line with our expectations.Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. On our website are 3",924,"To complete, insurance operations administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, 1% less than a year ago quarter and in line with our expectations.
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2012. As indicated on the schedule, invested assets were $11.6 billion, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.
There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. Of the fixed maturities, $10.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $764 million, compared to $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities of 6.9%, compared to 6.7% a year ago.
With a portfolio of leverage of 3x, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 24%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly the under the A- of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion compared to $873 million in the first quarter, and $156 million a year ago.
Now, regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $197 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.49% , an average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 27 years.
For the year, we have invested $430 million at an average rating of A-. The new money yield of 4.49% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011, and the 4.76% yield in the first quarter of this year.
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.43%, compared to 6.47% in the previous quarter and 6.56% in the second quarter 2011. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money rates. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.42%.
On July 5, the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the 2013 changes to the capital rules for banks, were issued. Subsequently we were notified that $301 million of our $708 million of bank hybrid trust preferred securities will be called in July and August. These securities have an average yield rate at 7.18%, and assuming the call proceeds are re-invested at 4.25%, the loss to annual income will be $9 million pre-tax, or $6 million after-tax. For 2012, the loss to income will be approximately $3 million after-tax and the portfolio yield will be reduced by about 8 basis points. This amount was accounted for in our guidance.
The remaining bank hybrids, we anticipate that another $300 million could be called. We don't know whether any of them will be called in the last half of 2012, but I expect the most of them to be called by end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35%, and assuming the same 4.25% investment rate, the lost annual income if all of those securities are called, will be a similar $6 million after-tax.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates continues to be the impact on earnings, not on the balance sheet.
To maintain our underwriting margins, we raised the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income's life products and the Direct Response funeral products by 5% at January 1 of this year. These increases provided additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies and we did so without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years, and that assumes a call of the $600 million of hybrid preferreds.
Last fall, we performed a stress test to determine the impact on the portfolio yield of investing all new money in at 4.75% over the next 5 years. Under that scenario, we determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016, would be between 5.95% and 6.10%. We have rerun the model this time using a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be around 5.75% to 5.85%.
At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. Even though we don't believe our new money rate will be as low as 4.25% for the next 5 years, should that happen, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended lower interest rate environment impact to income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off  DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital."

First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In second quarter, we spent $184 million to buy 3.9 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $47.42.
Going into the second quarter, we had anticipated spending price $90 million, which we did to acquire 1.9 million shares at an average cost of $48.54 per share. However due to favorable market conditions, we made the decision to acquire an additional 2 million shares during the quarter.
These additional shares were acquired for total cost of $94 million, an average cost of $46.39 per share this was less than a $48.54 per share paid to purchase the initial 1.9 million. For the full year through June 30, we had spent $274 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.8 million shares at an average price of $47.53.
The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
We expect to generate approximately $350 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus, the total liquid assets available for all of 2012 will be around $424 million. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated about $163 million of free cash flow but spent $274 million for Torchmark share repurchases, purchasing 5.8 million Torchmark shares. The repurchases were funded by $179 million from the cash on hand and $95 million from the issuance of additional commercial paper.
As a result of this activity, the parent ended the second quarter with $58 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets, plus $163 million of free cash flow, less $179 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $58 million on hand at the end of the second quarter, we should generate approximately $184 million of free cash flow in the next 2 quarters giving us $242 million of total cash available for the remainder of the year. $95 million of this cash will be used to reduce our commercial paper to its normal level, leaving us with approximately $147 million of liquid assets available between now and the end of the year.
It should be noted that we have already reduced the commercial paper outstanding by approximately $90 million since June 30. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain a minimum of $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now regarding the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but it's sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relative lower risk of our policy liabilities and our current ratings.
At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of the amount required for the targeted 325% ratio. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

That leaves another $301 million that could be called, and based on where their rates are, we feel they probably will be called. As we talked about this in previous analyst calls the reason these bonds are being called is there is a provision in those bonds that they can be called if there is a change in the capital rules, and they lose their capital status. Of course under Dodd-Frank those rules are going to be changed and those rules will be effective in 2013. So all along, we felt that the $600 million sort of the bond would probably be called and that they would be called in 2013. Early in the year, we read where some banks were looking at the fact, whenever the rules are published, which is expected to be in 2012, that, that would be the triggering event, not the actual implementation of the rules in 2013. That’s what has happened here, with these the $300 million, those banks are considering a triggering event happening when those rules are or at least the notice of the rule making was issued in July. So what we don't know is of the other $300 million that are potential calls.  We don't know whether the banks will determine 2012 as a trigger year or whether later 2013.

Net life sales increased 12% for the quarter to $41 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 5,472, up 23% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and are excited about the company’s future prospects. We continue to see growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level. It’s the first time, top bonus earners were up 47% in the third quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 14% in the third quarter. First time bonus earners and middle management trends are both indicators of future agent growth. We expect sales growth for 2012 to range from 13% to 15%, while we expect sales growth for 2013 to range from 10% to 15%.
Now Direct Response. Our Direct Response operation worldwide life premiums were up 9% to $158 million and life underwriting margin increased 8% to $37 million. Net life sales were up 3% to $31 million. While we’re pleased with Direct Response sales growth, it was slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, however, the new business written during the third quarter was more profitable than the new business written in a year ago quarter. We expect mid single-digit sales growth for 2012 and 2013.
Now Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was up 22% to $19 million. Net life sales declined 6% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 24% to $4 million. However, both net life and net health sales have increased sequentially for two quarters in a row. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,401, down 11% from a year ago, but up 4% just beginning of this year. The producing agent count grew to 1,420 during the first three weeks of the fourth quarter.
We continue to make progress in turning around our producing agent counts in sales of Liberty National. We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward and expect sales growth to range from 8% to 12% for 2013.
Medicare Part D, premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 63% to $83 million, while the underwriting margin increased 8% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 161% to $22 million due to the increase in low-income subsidized auto enrollees for 2012. We expect an increase of approximately 2% to 3% in our Part D premiums for 2013. This is less from the 2012 increase since we don’t expect this many new auto-enrollees out of our low income subsidy program next year.

For 2013, we expect a 5% to 6% increase in administrative expenses with most of the increase due to the acquisition of Family Heritage. However, as a percentage of premium, administrative expenses will be around the same level as 2012.
Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define is net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, a decline of $9 million or 14%, 7% on a per share basis from the third quarter of 2011.
Sequentially, excess investment income was down $8 million from the second quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines are due primarily to lower investment income. Compared to the second quarter, net investment income decreased $6 million or 3%, while average invested assets increased by 1%. And investment income increased at the same rate as the assets, investment income would have been up $1 million. This $7 million negative swing is due to the decline in the portfolio yield and the large increase in short-term investments, resulting primarily from the call of the $300 million of bank hybrid securities early in the third quarter. We plan to invest the excess short-term funds and bonds by the end of the year. Due to the expected call of our remaining $300 million of hybrid securities and the lower new money rates, we expect excess investment income in 2013 to decrease approximately 6% to 7%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect that 2013 excess investment income per share to be flat compared to 2012.
Now, regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $11.8 billion including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages.
At September 30, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling $685 million compared to $180 million at June 30. The additional $505 million of cash in short terms is due primarily to the $268 million of proceeds due to debt instruments issued late in the quarter and $237 million of additional funds to be invested. Now, of this amount, $200 million will be used for the acquisitions of Family Heritage Life, we think on November 1st, $120 million for the retirement of our trust preferred debt this week and $94 million to retire the existing August 2013 debt issue.
As to fixed maturities, $2.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $685 million compared to $764 million at the end of the second quarter and $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.3% compared to 6.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of three times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 21%, which is less than most of our peers. Both of these ratios have declined slightly since the end of the quarter as much of the excess cash held at September 30 has been invested in investment grade fixed maturities. Overall, the total portfolio is rated a high BBB plus just slightly under the A-minus of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.6 billion compared to $942 million a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $326 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.42%, an average rating of BBB plus and an average life of 23 years. For the year, we have invested $755 million at an average yield of 4.54% and an average rating of BBB plus.
The third quarter new money yield of 4.42% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 4.64% yield in the first half of 2012. Earlier this year, we indicated that the GAAP discount rates used to discount the reserves from policies issued in 2012 would be 4.75% graded to 6.5% over seven years. However, in response to the decline in new money yields and further indication that treasury rates will continue to be near current levels for the near future. We have changed the discount rates for policies issued in 2012 to 4.25% for five years, then graded up to 6.25% over the next eight years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.33% compared to 6.54% in the third quarter of 2011. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.33%.
As mentioned, we still hold $300 million of bank hybrids that could be called. We don’t know whether they will be called in the fourth quarter, but expect all of them to be called by the end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35% and assuming a 4.25% reinvestment rate, the loss to annual income with all of those securities are called will be $6 million after-tax. In our guidance, we assume that all will be called in 2013.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower prolonged rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rate continues to be impact on earnings, not the balance sheet.
As we talked about before, to maintain our underwriting margins, we’ve raised the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income Life products and the Direct Response unit products by 5% as of January 1 this year. These increases provided additional margins to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years and that assumes a call of the remaining $300 million of hybrid preferreds.
In the second quarter, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money rate of 4.25% and determine that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be in a range of 5.75% to 5.85%. At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities, while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. In this scenario, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don’t see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year",1386,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year through September 30, we have spent 318 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.6 million shares.
The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
During the first nine months of the year, we generated about $328 million of free cash flow but spent $318 million for Torchmark share repurchases. In addition to the remaining $83 million of cash and liquid assets, the parent received approximately $420 million as a result of the issuance on September 24th of 10-year senior notes and 40-year junior subordinated notes.
As a result of this activity the parent ended the second quarter with $504 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets plus the $328 million of free cash flow, plus $420 million of net debt proceeds, less the $318 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $504 million on hand at the end of the third quarter, we should generate approximately $22 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarters giving us $526 million of total cash and liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. Of this cash $120 million was used on October 24th to redeem our 7.1% trust preferred securities and approximately $212 million will be used to purchase the stock of Family Heritage Life, leaving us with approximately $194 million of cash and liquid assets available between now and the end of the year. It should be noted the $94 million of these assets will be invested to be used for the redemption of our $94 million of senior notes that mature on August 1, 2013 or an earlier time if opportunities to economically repurchase the August 2013 notes become available.
As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around in NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings that relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We expect our consolidated RBC as of the end of 2012 to be at or above this level.
Now before I turn the call back to Larry, I would like to briefly discuss our recent debt issue and the purchase of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company. First the debt issue. With regard to our debt, on September 24, we closed on $300 million, 3.8% senior debt issue maturing in 2022. The senior notes were issued to provide $94 million to pre-fund the eventual retirement of our August 2013 senior notes and $200 million to fund the acquisition of Family Heritage Life.
As we wanted to fund the majority of the Family Heritage Life acquisition internally, the parent issued $150 million of these notes to two of our insurance companies. Having these companies purchased the parent senior notes enabled us to one, efficiently use insurance company cash that resulted from the $300 million of bank hybrids they called in July and you get those funds invested at market rate.
Two, provide funds to the parent to fund the acquisition in a way that will allow these insurance companies to fully admit the asset on their statutory books. Three, structure of the transfer of funds to the parent in a way that minimizes the RBC charges that will be incurred by the insurance companies. And four, structure of public debt issue that was large enough to obtain the most efficient pricing available in the market. It should be noted that the $150 million of notes owned by the two insurance companies are limited in consolidation and thus are not treated as outstanding debt or the invested assets on our consolidated financial statements.
We also issued on September 24, $125 million of 40-year junior subordinated notes with an interest rate of 5% and 7%, 8%. Those notes are callable after five years and are issued to refinance $120 million of trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities were called on October 24. As a result for the new issuances, our debt balances as of September 30 increased by approximately $268 million, temporarily increasing our debt-to-capital ratio to 29.9% if the effects of the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity investments are ignored. However, this ratio will be reduced to 28.1% upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and to our normal levels once the august 2013 notes are redeemed.
We expect our interest expense will increase in the near term due to pre-funding of both the retirement of our trust preferred securities and the August 2013 maturity, plus the additional debt incurred for the Family Heritage purchase. For 2012, we estimate that this increase over 2011 levels will be approximately $2.1 million, including $1.9 million in the fourth quarter. For 2013, we estimate that our total interest expense will be approximately the same as 2012 levels, assuming the august note is retired on its August 1st maturity. Once the August note is retired, we expect to save approximately 1.5 million in annual interest expense over pre-2012 levels.
Now, with regard to the acquisition of the Family Heritage Life. On July 31st we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company, a privately-held supplemental health insurance provider, for approximately $218.5 million, including the assumption of $20 million in trust preferred securities with the remainder to be paid in cash. The ultimate purchase price is subject to closing adjustments to be paid using cash from a post-closing dividend from the company. We expect to close on November 1st assuming all regulatory approvals are received by that date.
The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a specialty insurer focused primarily on selling individual supplemental health insurance products with a return-of-premium feature. We were attracted to the company because of its offering of protection oriented insurance to middle income families and that their sales are through Family Heritage has approximately 1,200 captive sales agents, 41 sales directors and over 223,000 policies in force.
We are excited about the opportunity to work with the existing management, agents and employees of Family Heritage and currently intend to operate the company as a standalone operation.
As of June 30, 2012 statutory admitted assets of the Family Heritage were approximately $526 million and net capital and surplus was $62 million. Premiums were $162 million in 2011 and $87 million through June 30, 2012. Since the transaction has not yet closed and the fair market value of company’s fixed maturity portfolio and other assets are not yet known. The ultimate effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments cannot yet be determined. However, we anticipate that the company will add approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share to Torchmark’s net operating income in 2012, assuming a November 1 close and will add approximately $0.13 to $0.17 per share to 2013 operating earnings. Since we anticipate being able to take given distributions out of the company to fund the additional interest charges to be incurred by the parent, we do not believe the acquisition will have a material impact on our share buyback program.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.

Then secondly just on the Family Heritage deal, should the earnings ramp up as the year goes on or with the first quarter of next year be a normal quarter, just I wanted to get an idea on whether you plan to do any expense savings or any marketing initiatives that would either reduce or increase earnings in that the deal comes on your books?
And then finally on Liberty National, you’ve seen a couple of quarters of decent growth in the agent count of your sales expectations actually seem fairly positive as well. What gives you the comfort that this is not sort of a temporary blip in the agent count and what gives you the comfort as the thing that the agent counts are going to keep going from here on out.

As I mentioned, we did raise rates, the premium rights 5% this year, the effect of changing the interest rate assumption from what we had last year to this year, this year really we require about 2% to 3% increase in premium. So we actually increased the premium rates higher than we really needed but that - so but going forward, we still feel like the new level that we’ve gone in, the discount rates will be appropriate going forward.

So obviously just looking toward annualizing that you end up at around $176 million or $175 million and that’s around an 8.5% increase. So, we are again expecting that the premiums to go somewhere in that 8% to 10% range. I believe their sales but I don’t have that that number handy but I believe that it was somewhere in the $50 million range.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $167 million and life underwriting margin was also up 17% to $56 million. Net life sales increased 12% for the quarter to $41 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 5,472, up 23% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and are excited about the company’s future prospects. We continue to see growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level. It’s the first time top bonus earners were up 47% in the third quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 14% in the third quarter. First time bonus earners and middle management trends are both indicators of future agent growth. We expect sales growth for 2012 to range from 13% to 15%, while we expect sales growth for 2013 to range from 10% to 15%.
Now Direct Response. Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life life premiums were up 9% to $158 million and life underwriting margin increased 8% to $37 million. Net life sales were up 3% to $31 million. While we’re pleased with Direct Response sales growth, it was slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, however, the new business written during the third quarter was more profitable than the new business written in the year ago quarter. We expect mid single-digit sales growth for 2012 and 2013.
Now Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was up 22% to $19 million. Net life sales declined 6% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 24% to $4 million. However, both net life and net health sales have increased sequentially for 2 quarters in a row. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,401, down 11% from a year ago, but up 4% from just the beginning of this year. The producing agent count grew to 1,420 during the first 3 weeks of the fourth quarter.
We continue to make progress in turning around our producing agent counts in sales of Liberty National. We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward and expect sales growth to range from 8% to 12% for 2013.
Medicare Part D, premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 63% to $83 million, while the underwriting margin increased 8% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 161% to $22 million due to the increase in low-income subsidized auto enrollees for 2012. We expect an increase of approximately 2% to 3% in our Part D premiums for 2013. This is less from the 2012 increase since we don’t expect as many new auto-enrollees out of our low income subsidy program next year.

For 2013, we expect a 5% to 6% increase in administrative expenses with most of the increase due to the acquisition of Family Heritage. However, as a percentage of premium, administrative expenses will be around the same level as 2012.
Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, a decline of $9 million or 14%, 7% on a per share basis from the third quarter of 2011.
Sequentially, excess investment income was down $8 million from the second quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines are due primarily to lower investment income. Compared to the second quarter, net investment income decreased $6 million or 3%, while average invested assets increased by 1%. Had investment income increased at the same rate as the assets, investment income would have been up $1 million. This $7 million negative swing is due to the decline in the portfolio yield and the large increase in short-term investments, resulting primarily from the call of the $300 million of bank hybrid securities early in the third quarter. We plan to invest the excess short-term funds and bonds by the end of the year. Due to the expected call of our remaining $300 million of hybrid securities and the lower new money rates, we expect excess investment income in 2013 to decrease approximately 6% to 7%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect that 2013 excess investment income per share to be flat compared to 2012.
Now, regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $11.8 billion including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages.
At September 30, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling $685 million compared to $180 million at June 30. The additional $505 million of cash in short terms is due primarily to the $268 million of proceeds due to debt instruments issued late in the quarter and $237 million of additional funds to be invested. Now, of this amount, $200 million will be used for the acquisitions of Family Heritage Life, we think on November 1, $120 million for the retirement of our trust preferred debt this week and $94 million to retire the existing August 2013 debt issue.
As to fixed maturities, $2.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $685 million compared to $764 million at the end of the second quarter and $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.3% compared to 6.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 21%, which is less than most of our peers. Both of these ratios have declined slightly since the end of the quarter as much of the excess cash held at September 30 has been invested in investment grade fixed maturities. Overall, the total portfolio is rated a high BBB plus just slightly under the A-minus of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.6 billion compared to $942 million a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $326 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.42%, an average rating of BBB plus and an average life of 23 years. For the year, we have invested $755 million at an average yield of 4.54% and an average rating of BBB plus.
The third quarter new money yield of 4.42% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 4.64% yield in the first half of 2012. Earlier this year, we indicated that the GAAP discount rates used to discount the reserves from policies issued in 2012 would be 4.75% graded to 6.5% over 7 years. However, in response to the decline in new money yields and further indication that treasury rates will continue to be near current levels for the near future, we have changed the discount rates for policies issued in 2012 to 4.25% for 5 years, then graded up to 6.25% over the next 8 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.33% compared to 6.54% in the third quarter of 2011. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.33%.
As mentioned, we still hold $300 million of bank hybrids that could be called. We don’t know whether any of them will be called in the fourth quarter, but expect all of them to be called by the end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35% and assuming a 4.25% reinvestment rate, the loss to annual income with all of those securities are called will be $6 million after-tax. In our guidance, we assume that all will be called in 2013.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower prolonged rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rate continues to be the impact on earnings, not the balance sheet.
As we talked about before, to maintain our underwriting margins, we’ve raised the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income Life products and the Direct Response unit products by 5% as of January 1 this year. These increases provided additional margins to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years and that assumes a call of the remaining $300 million of hybrid preferreds.
In the second quarter, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be in a range of 5.75% to 5.85%. At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities, while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. In this scenario, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don’t see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital."
308916,223094030,370990,"Torchmark Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year",1398,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year through September 30, we have spent $318 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.6 million shares.
The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
During the first 9 months of the year, we generated about $328 million of free cash flow but spent $318 million for Torchmark share repurchases. In addition to the remaining $83 million of cash and liquid assets, the parent received approximately $420 million as a result of the issuance on September 24 of 10-year senior notes and 40-year junior subordinated notes.
As a result of this activity the parent ended the second quarter with $504 million of available liquid assets comprised of the $74 million of beginning liquid assets plus the $328 million of free cash flow, plus $420 million of net debt proceeds, less the $318 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $504 million on hand at the end of the third quarter, we should generate approximately $22 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter giving us $526 million of total cash and liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. Of this cash $120 million was used on October 24 to redeem our 7.1% trust preferred securities and approximately $212 million will be used to purchase the stock of Family Heritage Life, leaving us with approximately $194 million of cash and liquid assets available between now and the end of the year. It should be noted that $94 million of these assets will be invested to be used for the redemption of our $94 million of senior notes that mature on August 1, 2013 or an earlier time if opportunities to economically repurchase the August 2013 notes become available.
As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We expect our consolidated RBC as of the end of 2012 to be at or above this level.
Now before I turn the call back to Larry, I would like to briefly discuss our recent debt issue and the purchase of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company. First the debt issue. With regard to our debt, on September 24, we closed on a $300 million, 3.8% senior debt issue maturing in 2022. The senior notes were issued to provide $94 million to pre-fund the eventual retirement of our August 2013 senior notes and $200 million to fund the acquisition of Family Heritage Life.
As we wanted to fund the majority of the Family Heritage Life acquisition internally, the parent issued $150 million of these notes to 2 of our insurance companies. Having these companies purchase the parent senior notes enabled us to one, efficiently use insurance company cash that resulted from the $300 million of bank hybrids they called in July and to get those funds invested at market rate.
Two, provide funds to the parent to fund the acquisition in a way that will allow these insurance companies to fully admit the asset on their statutory books. Three, structure of the transfer of funds to the parent in a way that minimizes the RBC charges that will be incurred by the insurance companies. And four, structure of public debt issue that was large enough to obtain the most efficient pricing available in the market. It should be noted that the $150 million of notes owned by the 2 insurance companies are limited in consolidation and thus are not treated as outstanding debt or as invested assets on our consolidated financial statements.
We also issued on September 24, $125 million of 40-year junior subordinated notes with an interest rate of 5 7/8%. Those notes are callable after 5 years and are issued to refinance $120 million of trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities were called on October 24. As a result of the new issuances, our debt balances as of September 30 increased by approximately $268 million, temporarily increasing our debt-to-capital ratio to 29.9% if the effects of the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity investments are ignored. However, this ratio will be reduced to 28.1% upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and to our normal levels once the august 2013 notes are redeemed.
We expect our interest expense will increase in the near term due to pre-funding of both the retirement of our trust preferred securities and the August 2013 maturity, plus the additional debt incurred for the Family Heritage purchase. For 2012, we estimate that this increase over 2011 levels will be approximately $2.1 million, including $1.9 million in the fourth quarter. For 2013, we estimate that our total interest expense will be approximately the same as 2012 levels, assuming the August note is retired on its August 1 maturity. Once the August note is retired, we expect to save approximately 1.5 million in annual interest expense over pre-2012 levels.
Now, with regard to the acquisition of Family Heritage Life. On July 31 we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company, a privately-held supplemental health insurance provider, for approximately $218.5 million, including the assumption of $20 million in trust preferred securities with the remainder to be paid in cash. The ultimate purchase price is subject to closing adjustments to be paid using cash from a post-closing dividend from the company. We expect to close on November 1 assuming all regulatory approvals are received by that date.
The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a specialty insurer focused primarily on selling individual supplemental health insurance products with a return-of-premium feature. We were attracted to the company because of its offering of protection oriented insurance to middle income families and that their sales are through a captive agency force that we believe we can help grow. Family Heritage has approximately 1,200 captive sales agents, 41 sales directors and over 223,000 policies in force.
We are excited about the opportunity to work with the existing management, agents and employees of Family Heritage and currently intend to operate the company as a standalone operation.
As of June 30, 2012 statutory admitted assets of the Family Heritage were approximately $526 million and net capital and surplus was $62 million. Premiums were $162 million in 2011 and $87 million through June 30, 2012. Since the transaction has not yet closed and the fair market value of the company’s fixed maturity portfolio and other assets are not yet known, the ultimate effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments cannot yet be determined. However, we anticipate that the company will add approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share to Torchmark’s net operating income in 2012, assuming a November 1 close and will add approximately $0.13 to $0.17 per share to 2013 operating earnings. Since we anticipate being able to take given distributions out of the company to fund the additional interest charges to be incurred by the parent, we do not believe the acquisition will have a material impact on our share buyback program.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $167 million and life underwriting margin was also up 17% to $56 million. Net life sales increased 12% for the quarter to $41 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 5,472, up 23% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and are excited about the company’s future prospects. We continue to see growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level. It’s the first time top bonus earners were up 47% in the third quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 14% in the third quarter. First time bonus earners and middle management trends are both indicators of future agent growth. We expect sales growth for 2012 to range from 13% to 15%, while we expect sales growth for 2013 to range from 10% to 15%.
Now Direct Response. Our Direct Response operation at Globe Life life premiums were up 9% to $158 million and life underwriting margin increased 8% to $37 million. Net life sales were up 3% to $31 million. While we’re pleased with Direct Response sales growth, it was slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, however, the new business written during the third quarter was more profitable than the new business written in the year ago quarter. We expect mid single-digit sales growth for 2012 and 2013.
Now Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was up 22% to $19 million. Net life sales declined 6% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 24% to $4 million. However, both net life and net health sales have increased sequentially for 2 quarters in a row. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,401, down 11% from a year ago, but up 4% from just the beginning of this year. The producing agent count grew to 1,420 during the first 3 weeks of the fourth quarter.
We continue to make progress in turning around our producing agent counts in sales of Liberty National. We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward and expect sales growth to range from 8% to 12% for 2013.
Medicare Part D, premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 63% to $83 million, while the underwriting margin increased 8% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 161% to $22 million due to the increase in low-income subsidized auto enrollees for 2012. We expect an increase of approximately 2% to 3% in our Part D premiums for 2013. This is less from the 2012 increase since we don’t expect as many new auto-enrollees out of our low income subsidy program next year.

Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, a decline of $9 million or 14%, 7% on a per share basis from the third quarter of 2011.
Sequentially, excess investment income was down $8 million from the second quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines are due primarily to lower investment income. Compared to the second quarter, net investment income decreased $6 million or 3%, while average invested assets increased by 1%. Had investment income increased at the same rate as the assets, investment income would have been up $1 million. This $7 million negative swing is due to the decline in the portfolio yield and the large increase in short-term investments, resulting primarily from the call of the $300 million of bank hybrid securities early in the third quarter. We plan to invest the excess short-term funds and bonds by the end of the year. Due to the expected call of our remaining $300 million of hybrid securities and the lower new money rates, we expect excess investment income in 2013 to decrease approximately 6% to 7%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect that 2013 excess investment income per share to be flat compared to 2012.
Now, regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $11.8 billion including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages.
At September 30, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling $685 million compared to $180 million at June 30. The additional $505 million of cash in short terms is due primarily to the $268 million of proceeds due to debt instruments issued late in the quarter and $237 million of additional funds to be invested. Now, of this amount, $200 million will be used for the acquisitions of Family Heritage Life, we think on November 1, $120 million for the retirement of our trust preferred debt this week and $94 million to retire the existing August 2013 debt issue.
As to fixed maturities, $2.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $685 million compared to $764 million at the end of the second quarter and $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.3% compared to 6.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 21%, which is less than most of our peers. Both of these ratios have declined slightly since the end of the quarter as much of the excess cash held at September 30 has been invested in investment grade fixed maturities. Overall, the total portfolio is rated a high BBB plus just slightly under the A-minus of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.6 billion compared to $942 million a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $326 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.42%, an average rating of BBB plus and an average life of 23 years. For the year, we have invested $755 million at an average yield of 4.54% and an average rating of BBB plus.
The third quarter new money yield of 4.42% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 4.64% yield in the first half of 2012. Earlier this year, we indicated that the GAAP discount rates used to discount the reserves from policies issued in 2012 would be 4.75% graded to 6.5% over 7 years. However, in response to the decline in new money yields and further indication that treasury rates will continue to be near current levels for the near future, we have changed the discount rates for policies issued in 2012 to 4.25% for 5 years, then graded up to 6.25% over the next 8 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.33% compared to 6.54% in the third quarter of 2011. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.33%.
As mentioned, we still hold $300 million of bank hybrids that could be called. We don’t know whether any of them will be called in the fourth quarter, but expect all of them to be called by the end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35% and assuming a 4.25% reinvestment rate, the loss to annual income with all of those securities are called will be $6 million after-tax. In our guidance, we assume that all will be called in 2013.
On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower prolonged rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rate continues to be the impact on earnings, not the balance sheet.
As we talked about before, to maintain our underwriting margins, we’ve raised the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income Life products and the Direct Response unit products by 5% as of January 1 this year. These increases provided additional margins to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales.
However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years and that assumes a call of the remaining $300 million of hybrid preferreds.
In the second quarter, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be in a range of 5.75% to 5.85%. At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities, while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. In this scenario, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.
As I mentioned, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don’t see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital."
308916,223094030,371013,"Torchmark Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year",1398,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year through September 30, we have spent $318 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.6 million shares.
The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.
During the first 9 months of the year, we generated about $328 million of free cash flow but spent $318 million for Torchmark share repurchases. In addition to the remaining $83 million of cash and liquid assets, the parent received approximately $420 million as a result of the issuance on September 24 of 10-year senior notes and 40-year junior subordinated notes.
As a result of this activity the parent ended the second quarter with $504 million of available liquid assets comprised of the $74 million of beginning liquid assets plus the $328 million of free cash flow, plus $420 million of net debt proceeds, less the $318 million used for share repurchases.
Going forward, along with the $504 million on hand at the end of the third quarter, we should generate approximately $22 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter giving us $526 million of total cash and liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. Of this cash $120 million was used on October 24 to redeem our 7.1% trust preferred securities and approximately $212 million will be used to purchase the stock of Family Heritage Life, leaving us with approximately $194 million of cash and liquid assets available between now and the end of the year. It should be noted that $94 million of these assets will be invested to be used for the redemption of our $94 million of senior notes that mature on August 1, 2013 or an earlier time if opportunities to economically repurchase the August 2013 notes become available.
As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.
Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last 2 years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We expect our consolidated RBC as of the end of 2012 to be at or above this level.
Now before I turn the call back to Larry, I would like to briefly discuss our recent debt issue and the purchase of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company. First the debt issue. With regard to our debt, on September 24, we closed on a $300 million, 3.8% senior debt issue maturing in 2022. The senior notes were issued to provide $94 million to pre-fund the eventual retirement of our August 2013 senior notes and $200 million to fund the acquisition of Family Heritage Life.
As we wanted to fund the majority of the Family Heritage Life acquisition internally, the parent issued $150 million of these notes to 2 of our insurance companies. Having these companies purchase the parent senior notes enabled us to one, efficiently use insurance company cash that resulted from the $300 million of bank hybrids they called in July and to get those funds invested at market rate.
Two, provide funds to the parent to fund the acquisition in a way that will allow these insurance companies to fully admit the asset on their statutory books. Three, structure of the transfer of funds to the parent in a way that minimizes the RBC charges that will be incurred by the insurance companies. And four, structure of public debt issue that was large enough to obtain the most efficient pricing available in the market. It should be noted that the $150 million of notes owned by the 2 insurance companies are limited in consolidation and thus are not treated as outstanding debt or as invested assets on our consolidated financial statements.
We also issued on September 24, $125 million of 40-year junior subordinated notes with an interest rate of 5 7/8%. Those notes are callable after 5 years and are issued to refinance $120 million of trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities were called on October 24. As a result of the new issuances, our debt balances as of September 30 increased by approximately $268 million, temporarily increasing our debt-to-capital ratio to 29.9% if the effects of the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity investments are ignored. However, this ratio will be reduced to 28.1% upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and to our normal levels once the august 2013 notes are redeemed.
We expect our interest expense will increase in the near term due to pre-funding of both the retirement of our trust preferred securities and the August 2013 maturity, plus the additional debt incurred for the Family Heritage purchase. For 2012, we estimate that this increase over 2011 levels will be approximately $2.1 million, including $1.9 million in the fourth quarter. For 2013, we estimate that our total interest expense will be approximately the same as 2012 levels, assuming the August note is retired on its August 1 maturity. Once the August note is retired, we expect to save approximately 1.5 million in annual interest expense over pre-2012 levels.
Now, with regard to the acquisition of Family Heritage Life. On July 31 we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company, a privately-held supplemental health insurance provider, for approximately $218.5 million, including the assumption of $20 million in trust preferred securities with the remainder to be paid in cash. The ultimate purchase price is subject to closing adjustments to be paid using cash from a post-closing dividend from the company. We expect to close on November 1 assuming all regulatory approvals are received by that date.
The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a specialty insurer focused primarily on selling individual supplemental health insurance products with a return-of-premium feature. We were attracted to the company because of its offering of protection oriented insurance to middle income families and that their sales are through a captive agency force that we believe we can help grow. Family Heritage has approximately 1,200 captive sales agents, 41 sales directors and over 223,000 policies in force.
We are excited about the opportunity to work with the existing management, agents and employees of Family Heritage and currently intend to operate the company as a standalone operation.
As of June 30, 2012 statutory admitted assets of the Family Heritage were approximately $526 million and net capital and surplus was $62 million. Premiums were $162 million in 2011 and $87 million through June 30, 2012. Since the transaction has not yet closed and the fair market value of the company’s fixed maturity portfolio and other assets are not yet known, the ultimate effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments cannot yet be determined. However, we anticipate that the company will add approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share to Torchmark’s net operating income in 2012, assuming a November 1 close and will add approximately $0.13 to $0.17 per share to 2013 operating earnings. Since we anticipate being able to take given distributions out of the company to fund the additional interest charges to be incurred by the parent, we do not believe the acquisition will have a material impact on our share buyback program.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4,381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.
While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4,600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.
Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact of the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first 3 quarters of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1,345, down 33% for the year.
Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increased to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.
The volume of business for new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2,000 per month, for January and February, we have averaged closer to 6,000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75,000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24,000. 
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."

First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.4 billion, including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities, $10.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $701 million compared to $863 million a year ago. The $162 million decline this year is due primarily to $140 million of dispositions and $22 million of net upgrades. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.4%, compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. With a portfolio leverage of 3x, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%, which is less than most of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB plus a year ago. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $964 million compared to gains of $942 million at the end of the third quarter, and $108 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to slight declines in treasury yields and credit spreads. Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $273 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.22%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 28 years. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 5.65% and an average rating of A-.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.52% compared to 6.54% in the previous quarter and 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31, yield on the portfolio is 6.49%. Regarding RBC, as we have said before we plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last few years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in the light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we haven't finalized our 2011 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/11 will be around the 325% target. Now regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the fourth quarter we used $67 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $788 million to acquire 18.9 million shares or 16% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. At December 31, the parent company had liquid assets of $74 million. In addition to these assets the parents will generate additional free cash in 2012. We define annual free cash flow as the dividends received from the subsidiaries, less interest expense and less the dividends paid to our shareholders.
Assuming shareholder dividends at the current level, we expect free cash flow in 2012 to be around $350 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $74 million of assets on hand, we will have approximately $425 million to $435 million of cash available to the parent during the year. To date in 2012, we have used $16 million of this cash to buy 355,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If marketing conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. As of January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will now be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows, or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard has been in place from prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be around 16% of the current DAC assets, which will result in around a 10% reduction in GAAP equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturities. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules. And that ROE, excluding net unrealized gains or losses, will rise from the current 14% level to 15%, to 16%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012.
Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark."

Well, first off, Jimmy, on as far as American Income recruiting -- and I'm not sure if it was the way the holidays fell, we did see a drop off the last couple of weeks of the year which caused a little dip there. The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it's at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we're up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.
So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it's going to take 6 months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we'll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully turnaround from there.

And for policies issued in 2011, we did drop the discount rate to 5.75% which in prior years had been leaning closer to 6.5%. But the 2011 issues we're having, this is a small impact when you look at the overall block of business that we have. And so, the increase is coming from the fact that they have more of the business at those higher rates for the few years prior to 2011. But I think the rate where it is, it's not going to go up much from here, and in the long run it will start trending down."

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4,381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.
While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4,600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.
Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact of the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first 3 quarters of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1,345, down 33% for the year.
Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increased to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.
The volume of business for new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2,000 per month, for January and February, we have averaged closer to 6,000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75,000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24,000. 
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2",894,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. 
First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.4 billion, including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.
Of the fixed maturities, $10.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $701 million compared to $863 million a year ago. The $162 million decline this year is due primarily to $140 million of dispositions and $22 million of net upgrades. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.4%, compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. With a portfolio leverage of 3x, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%, which is less than most of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB plus a year ago. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $964 million compared to gains of $942 million at the end of the third quarter, and $108 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to slight declines in treasury yields and credit spreads. Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $273 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.22%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 28 years. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 5.65% and an average rating of A-.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.52% compared to 6.54% in the previous quarter and 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31, yield on the portfolio is 6.49%. Regarding RBC, as we have said before we plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last few years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in the light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we haven't finalized our 2011 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/11 will be around the 325% target. Now regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the fourth quarter we used $67 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $788 million to acquire 18.9 million shares or 16% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. At December 31, the parent company had liquid assets of $74 million. In addition to these assets the parents will generate additional free cash in 2012. We define annual free cash flow as the dividends received from the subsidiaries, less interest expense and less the dividends paid to our shareholders.
Assuming shareholder dividends at the current level, we expect free cash flow in 2012 to be around $350 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $74 million of assets on hand, we will have approximately $425 million to $435 million of cash available to the parent during the year. To date in 2012, we have used $16 million of this cash to buy 355,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If marketing conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. As of January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will now be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows, or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard has been in place from prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be around 16% of the current DAC assets, which will result in around a 10% reduction in GAAP equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturities. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules. And that ROE, excluding net unrealized gains or losses, will rise from the current 14% level to 15%, to 16%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012.
Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark."

Well, first off, Jimmy, on as far as American Income recruiting -- and I'm not sure if it was the way the holidays fell, we did see a drop off the last couple of weeks of the year which caused a little dip there. The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it's at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we're up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.
So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it's going to take 6 months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we'll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully turnaround from there.

Again we went from a 130 offices down to 70 in a little over a year. And part of the reason for that was just to get the expenses in line and get the profitability of the business up where it needs to be. So that had a big impact on recruiting. When you go from 130 managers down to 70, it's going to impact the number of new agents we recruit. As far as, in fact I am looking at that number, I don't really have an answer, Steven, for why that went from 552 to 648 on the veteran agents. I'll look into it and I can have Mike get back to you on that."

But we do have just under $750 million of bank trust preferreds, hybrids that would -- that are contingent calls. And we expect a large number of those to be called but up until recently, with the expectation that those calls would occur in 2013. But as you mentioned there is talk that some of the banks are instead waiting [ph] for the change and that was tied to the change in the Tier 1 capital rules, but now there is some indication that some banks will say, well, when these rules are issued in 2012 that will be the triggering event that'll allow them to call the securities. So, we really don't know how that's going to work out, whether there will be sizable amount in 2012 or it will be 2013. You're right, it will have an impact on our yield. The yields on those are just little over 7%. And if we refinance or reinvest at 4.75%, it would be a significant change to the yield. In the last call, we talked about, if we invested in rates at 4.75% for the next 5 years, what would happen to the portfolio yield and I think what we said at 5 years from now, it's a yield of 6.49% as it does today, the portfolio would be yielding 6%. Well in that, in those projections, we assume that these trust preferreds would be called and that the money would be reinvested at 4.75%. So, that projection is still good, the question is though, if it will, some of them happen in 2012 and we just don't know."
