I'd like to take a few minutes and the beginning just to talk about the big picture.

I'd like to take a few minutes and the beginning just to talk about the big picture. 
The Apartment business was good last year and I think will be as good or better this year. Demographics remain strongly positive and the economy seems to be slowly recovered. And I'm pretty sure that 2012 will be a very solid year for Aimco. About 1/2 of our expected rent growth is already in the bank from leases  made last year and so far this year just waiting to earn in. Our Renewal business remains quite steady with more than 1/2 of our customers renewing their leases at rents up 5% or more. 
In most markets, we enjoyed steady consumer demand for new leases, which is up average daily occupancy and producing higher rents. 
Our portfolio is good and getting better. It is more and more concentrated than the most desirable markets with higher rents and greater expected rent growth. Last year, average rents were up 9% to more than $1,140. This year, we expect average rents to be up another $120 or 10%, more than $1,260. About 1/2 of that increase in average rents will come from rent growth and about 1/2 will come from the sale of properties with lower rent. 
We imply the same selling discipline to our Affordable portfolio where we plan to sell 60 Affordable properties this year, reducing our allocation to the Affordable business to less than 10% of net asset value. 
On the buy side, we expect to make at least $200 million of property acquisitions, primarily by buying out limited partners in 11 partnerships that own 19 properties. We've already closed on 4 of these transactions and we expect to close the 3 more this month. 
We like partnerships acquisitions because we already operate in real estate and know it well. Partnership acquisition are especially accretive where we can eliminate overhead costs. For example, all 7 of the transactions that we closed in January or expect to close in February are public partnerships, all the cost of SEC reporting, required audits, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and so on and that's a lot of cost to eliminate. So that's it. 
After this year we'll be largely done with a decade of partnership acquisitions and we will enjoy a simpler, more transparent lower-cost business. So we are actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities especially where we see that our operating and redevelopment skills can add value and enhance returns. 
Even as we upgrade our portfolio by selling weaker properties, we are also having higher rent, better located properties to redevelopment. Over the next few years, redevelopment will be an important contributor to improve portfolio quality and the faster rent growth. We expect to have 8 redevelopments underway this year. 4 in coastal California and 4 others in Seattle, Chicago and Philadelphia. We expect to spend more than $400 million in these properties over the next 2 years or so with current returns on untrended rents greater than 7% and unlevered internal rates of return greater than 10%. 
Three, Treetops, which is now known as Pacific Bay business, Lincoln Place and Madera Vista are currently vacant to the return to service with more than 1,200 units with target rents over $2,400, will upgrade our portfolio and these especially accretive. The findings, we have a big pipeline of redevelopment opportunities for 2 or 3 years. 
We remain focused on simplifying our business and reducing costs. As I mentioned earlier, closing out 11 more property partnerships will save legal accounting and other overhead costs. We've also agreed to sell, a legacy asset management business and management buyout. 
While the final closing will be later this year after conditions are satisfied and regulatory approvals are received, overhead savings are already being realized. So once more, Aimco upside costs will be down year-over-year and this year by another 12% or $12 million. 
Aimco balance sheet is liquid and save. Our business is self funding with ample liquidity including a new $500 million unused revolving line of credit with an extended term and reduced prices. We have limited near-term refunding obligations, largely fixed interest rates and essentially no debt with recourse to income. 
This property income increasing, retained earnings supplies to amortized property debt and opportunistic redemption of a high-cost preferred stock, we expect balance sheet leverage to come down over the next few years. For example, we expect the ratio on EBITDA-to-interest to be about 2.5:1 by the fourth quarter of this year. We expect the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA to be less than 7.5:1 by year end. 
In sum, we have a favorable environment, a clear plan and a veteran team that works well together. We expect 2012 to be a year of steady progress across all metrics. With this in mind, the Aimco Board of Directors reasserted to increase the stock dividend by 50% to the annual rate of $0.72 per share. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Aimco Property Operation. Keith and his team are doing a great job and I thank them for their hard work. Keith?"

I'm exceptionally proud of the accomplishments of the team that I'm fortunate to lead. During 2011, we successfully increased rents and saw improvement year-over-year each quarter. We stayed disciplined of our costs and actually reduced expenses both on and offsite year-over-year. We upgraded our technology, implemented a new property operating system and redesigned the Aimco website, thereby, enhancing the customer experience. And we retained a high percentage of our residents base by the prioritization of customer service and customer satisfaction. 
We finished 2011 on a positive note with Conventional Same Store fourth quarter NOI up 5.3% over the third quarter and up 5.8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by revenues being up 0.8% over the third quarter and up 3.3% year-over-year, while expenses were down 0.6% compared to the third quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Now for some additional context around the fourth quarter revenue numbers. Fourth quarter renewal rents were up 5.2% and new lease rents were up 0.7% for a blended increase of 3%. In our target markets, which represent about 86% of our NOI, occupancy was stable and new lease rents were up 1.6%. 
In our non-target markets, we focused on gaining occupancy and getting to a strong jump up to 2012. After some softening early in the fourth quarter, demand strengthened. And we finished 2011 with high occupancy across the portfolio. 
Average daily occupancy increased each week during the November and December to the year end of 95.7%. For the full year 2011, Conventional Affordable Same Store NOI was up 5.9% driven by revenues being up 2.9% and expenses being down 1.8%. 
Now for 2012. We began the year in good shape, thanks to solid 2011 leasing activity, which will contribute 2.1% to the 2012 revenue growth, substantially better than the 0.4% we started with in 2011. 
January is on track, finishing according to plan. We remain highly focused on cost control. The expected increase year-over-year in expenses is entirely due to higher property taxes and property insurance costs. Utility expense increases are reimbursed by our customers. And in aggregate, all expenses will be flat or down year-over-year driven by operational efficiencies. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the stellar work of my colleagues, particularly, Karen Erasco and Kevin Rozier, the area Vice Presidents of the east and west property operations. Proud to be part of a team so wholeheartedly dedicated to Aimco's vision. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss 2012 guidance. We provided 2011 highlights from operation so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopment, balance sheet and financial results. John Bezzant and the transactio",947,"Thank you, Keith. I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss 2012 guidance. We provided 2011 highlights from operation so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopment, balance sheet and financial results. 
John Bezzant and the transactions team sold 151 properties in 2011. They sold 25 low-rate Conventional properties. These properties have average rents of $649 compared to our current portfolio today of $1,143. We also sold 45 Affordable properties for an average ownership was 39% and we continue to reduce the size of our third-party asset management activities to the sale of 81, properties. Properties we retain have higher rents and higher expected rent and NOI growth. Importantly, capital replacement or CR spending is a smaller percentage of their revenue and in the case for lower rent properties. 
As a result of the 2011 property sales, we expect free cash flow margin and AFFO to grow faster than NOI margin and FFO. 
Turning to redevelopment. Dan Matula and the team broke ground on our Pacific Bay redevelopment, starting the first phase of our Lincoln Place redevelopment and established a pipeline of projects lined up for starts in 2012 and 2013. Just 3 of these properties are presently baked in, we do not expect the redevelopment activity to be near-term dilutive to FFO and AFFO. We do expect it to be accretive in 2013 and beyond. 
Regarding the balance sheet. Our coverage has improved during 2011 due to earnings growth and a net reduction in debt. EBITDA coverage of interest increased to 2 18:1 to 2 07:1. EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends also increased to 1 78:1 to 1 68:1. A detailed and supplemental schedule for our earnings release, we reduced total leverage, which includes preferred stock by $84 million. 
Adding fuel in our team, we refinanced over $6 million of property debt maturing in the years 2011 through 2015 at rates averaging 4.9%. These loans mature on average in 9 years. There are properties that is held back by 46 insurance companies, pension funds, banks and other institution in addition to the GSEs. 
We also increased our revolving credit facility expanding the number of participants, ending the maturity dates to December 2016, inclusive of extension options and reducing its costs. In addition to lowering our total amount of preferred equity, we also issued a new class of preferred equity with a total coupon of 7%. Both of these from initial offering were used to redeem higher cost of preferred equity. 
The efforts of Keith, John, Dan, Patti and the entire Aimco team led FFO up 11% year-over-year from 2010 and AFFO up by 5%. 
Turning to 2012, you'll find on Page 5 of our earnings release our detailed guidance for the full year of 2012 as well as guidance for the first quarter. There's a lot of information there so rather than reading the schedule to everyone, I'll just point out a few key items. 
Projected full year FFO is $1.70 to  $1.82 per share. At the midpoint, this is an increase of about 8% from our 2011 AFFO, $1.64. AFFO is anticipated to be up about 21% from 2011. FFO growth is driven primarily by expected revenue growth and lower offsite costs. AFFO was up more due to delevering effect of lower rent assets that required similar amounts of capital replacement spending at the current portfolio. 
Our assumptions around operating results are as follows. Full year NOI growth for our Conventional Same Store portfolio is expected to be between 5.25% and 7.25% with revenue growth of 4.5% and 5.5% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3%. Keith pointed out the expense increases are due almost entirely to the anticipated increases in property taxes and property insurance. 
While utility and costs are also expected to increase, these increases will be offset by reimbursements from our customers. All other expense line items in the aggregate are expected to be flat or down. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we entered 2012 with $173 million of property debt maturities in the next 12 months. This rate loss of $55 million of that amount leaving us $118 million or about 2.5% of our total property debt remaining to refinance. 
Property debt amortization in 2012 will be $83 million or a little less than 2% of our property debt. We now said in our earnings news release that we entered into an agreement to transfer Asset Management of our, portfolio effective February 6  and to sell the minority interest of the portfolio to the new asset manager upon satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect the sale to close later in the second half of 2012. 
With this sale, we will liquidate all of our legacy Asset Management business. In 2011, we generated less than $0.01 of FFO from our, relationship. And is anticipated that for 2012, we'll generate a similar amount of FFO. 
On Page 4 of the earnings release, we discussed how we expect coverages to further improve from 2012 from our growth of operations and balance sheet activities. 
Annualizing  our anticipated EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect EBITDA coverage of interest expense to be approximately 2.5:1. EBITDA coverage of interest expense and preferred dividends to be approximately 2:1. Debt to EBITDA of approximately 7.5x and debt and preferred equity EBITDA of approximately 9x. 
I'm happy to report that we're off to good start in all of these areas and we are looking forward to a successful year ahead. With that, we will now open up the call for questions. 
Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please?"

In our guidance, we provided sequential NOI growth from our Conventional Same Store play to be about the midpoint of about 3%. And that's mainly due to the expenses. We do expect revenues to be up about $0.01 but we expect expenses to offset unfortunately be down about $0.04. And that's just part of that is seasonal as we go from the fourth quarter to  first quarter in terms of the utility cost. And part of that is we had just a very good expense quarter in the fourth quarter. Secondly, Eric, we had about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 of nonrecurring income. And we're not projecting nonrecurring income in the first quarter. That's not the $0.02 going down for us. That gets you from a $0.41 to about $0.36 and there's much other small things from us that's about $0.01 being down. So that's how we expect to end up at $0.35 at the midpoint with our first quarter 2012. Regarding what happens, Eric and for the rest of you, I don't want to get ahead of myself and quarter of the guidance going forward. But as you can see from what we're expecting from revenue growth and where we expect expense to be NOI for our whole portfolio, we do expect the operations to kick strong contribution in the year for us as we finish out 2012. And then you also know that in our guidance, we provided guidance for nonrecurring revenue of about $6 million, which is a little more back-end weighted in our numbers. And that's how we'll see our FFO contribution ramp up in the second, third and fourth quarter."

So I don't want to talk about too much on what happens in the future. So with the fact that's it's only $0.01 in 2012 so it won't have a big difference. I think it's important to point out and you're right to point it out on our numbers that you see that there is a dilution from asset sales of $0.13. But offsetting that is the reduction in expenses across the organization of $0.09. So on state, it sounds like our sell activity is quite dilutive by the stable $1 million, as we simplify the company, we take other costs and we reduce our scale. And we really net those 2 numbers, you can see that even with all that tells me that it hasn't been that dilutive for us on an overall basis. And going forward we would expect something similar but the sale but we are contemplating in 2012. And the fact is that we contemplate those sales we have the opportunity to continue to save costs."

And we did see the pricing is off a little bit more than non-target markets, which makes about 40% of our NOI than we grew occupancy significantly and put us in a strong position for starting in 2012. And our overall basis and I think similar to what other folks have been reporting for new lease rates and in the fourth quarter, our numbers on aggregate basis were about where those folks were. And in fact in our target portfolios, we're at the top end of that. That's carried over into January where things get modestly better but we haven't seen any spike from the new lease rates from where they are at today. But without providing guidance, Dave, to what's going to happen in the second, third and fourth quarters specifically around renewal and lease rates. And we do expect for the year that on a blended basis, we are being north of 5% on those. And as you can see from our numbers in the fourth quarter, we are already for renewals but there will be a lot of hard work to make sure we stay there for renewal. And we hope we can do even better. And as you saw in our numbers and during 2011, we had a pretty big spike in the new lease  rates as we got into the summer peak season and then trended down, which I think is very similar to almost everyone in the industry. I'm not within 2012 to look exactly like that but it will be surprising if they have, if similar to that."

On portable Affordable, we expect Affordable to be up -- Affordable Same Store to be up from flat to 1%. It's mainly driven by a revenue increase but a little less than increase we saw in 2011 because we had some larger Affordable project that had the rent, the 5-year rent come up and we got a nice bump. We're not going to see that in 2012. And then on expenses behave similarly on the portfolio maybe a little bit more growth than we have in our Conventional portfolio. So Affordable will be up 0 to 1, the Affordable Same Store portfolio. Real estate tax is embedded in our guidance real estate taxes will increase between 5% and 6% and that's where the Conventional Same Store portfolio year-over-year. Within that number, Mike, 3.5% of the 5% to 6% is due to our expectation that both assessment and our tax rates are going to go up year-over-year. The other part then, the part that's the 3.5, so roughly the 1.5% to 2.5%, that increased due to the fact that we do expect we'll have less successful appeals on filing taxes in 2012 than we had in 2011. So again, real estate taxes embedded in our guidance, we're assuming to go up 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. Finally, with the Asset Management business. That's really going to contribute $0.01 to us overall in 2012. Basically, the revenues almost offset the expenses for that business. And then actually that business is something that's taxed and in our TRF as well. So the tax expense is associated with profits from that. So we basically expect that revenues we generate before taxes are offset more or less by expenses to run those assets. And then there's a minor tax expense associated with those to bring it down to less than a $0.01."

I'd like to take a few minutes at the beginning just to talk about the big picture. 
The apartment business was good last year, and I think it will be as good or better this year. Demographics remain strongly positive, and the economy seems to be slowly recovered. And I'm pretty sure that 2012 will be a very solid year for Aimco. About half of our expected rent growth is already in the bank from leases made last year and, so far, this year just waiting to earn in. Our renewal business remains quite steady, with more than half of our customers renewing their leases at rents up 5% and more. In most markets, we enjoyed steady consumer demand for new leases, pushing up average daily occupancy and producing higher rents.
Our portfolio is good and getting better. It is more and more concentrated than the most desirable markets, with higher rents and greater expected rent growth. Last year, average rents were up 9% to more than $1,140. This year, we expect average rents to be up another $120 or 10%, more than $1,260. About half of that increase in average rents will come from rent growth and about half will come from the sale of properties with lower rents. 
We apply the same selling discipline to our Affordable portfolio, where we plan to sell 60 Affordable properties this year, reducing our allocation to the Affordable business to less than 10% of net asset value. 
On the buy side, we expect to make at least $200 million of property acquisitions, primarily by buying out limited partners in 11 partnerships that own 19 properties. We've already closed on 4 of these transactions, and we expect to close 3 more this month. We like partnerships acquisitions because we already operate in the real estate and know it well. Partnership acquisitions are especially accretive, where we can eliminate overhead costs. For example, all 7 of the transactions that we closed in January or expect to close in February are public partnerships, with all the costs of SEC reporting, required audits, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and so on, and that's a lot of costs to eliminate. So that's it. After this year, we'll be largely done with a decade of partnership acquisitions, and we will enjoy a simpler, more transparent, lower-cost business. So we're actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities, especially where we see that our operating and redevelopment skills can add value and enhance returns. 
Even as we upgrade our portfolio by selling weaker properties, we are also adding higher-rent, better-located properties to redevelopment. Over the next few years, redevelopment will be an important contributor to improve portfolio quality and to faster rent growth. We expect to have 8 redevelopments underway this year: 4 in coastal California and 4 others in Seattle, Chicago and Philadelphia. We expect to spend more than $400 million in these properties over the next 2 years or so with current returns on untrended rents greater than 7% and unlevered internal rates of return greater than 10%. 
Three: Treetops, which is now known as Pacific Bay Vistas, Lincoln Place and Madera Vista, are currently vacant due to the return to service of more than 1,200 units, with target rents over $2,400, will upgrade our portfolio and these especially accretive. Behind this, we have a deep pipeline of other good redevelopment opportunities for future here. 
We remain focused on simplifying our business and reducing costs. As I mentioned earlier, closing out 11 more property partnerships will save legal, accounting and other overhead costs. We've also agreed to sell the NAPICO, a legacy asset management business, in a management buyout. While the final closing will be later this year after conditions are satisfied and regulatory approvals are received, overhead savings are already being realized. So once more, Aimco upside costs will be down year-over-year this year by another 12% or $12 million. 
The Aimco balance sheet is liquid and save. Our business is self-funding with ample liquidity, including a new $500 million unused revolving line of credit with an extended term and reduced pricing. We have limited near-term refunding obligations, largely fixed interest rates and essentially no debt with recourse to income. 
With property income increasing, retained earnings supplies to amortized property debt and opportunistic redemption of high-cost preferred stocks, we expect balance sheet leverage to come down over the next few years. For example, we expect the ratio of EBITDA to interest to be about 2.5:1 by the fourth quarter of the year. We expect the ratio of debt to EBITDA to be less than 7.5:1 by year end. 
In sum, we have a favorable environment, a clear plan and a veteran team that works well together. We expect 2012 to be a year of steady progress across all metrics. With this in mind, the Aimco Board of Directors voted yesterday to increase the common stock dividend by 50% to the annual rate of $0.72 per share. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Aimco Property Operations. Keith and his team are doing a great job, and I thank them for their hard work. Keith?"

I'm exceptionally proud of the accomplishments of the team that I'm fortunate to lead. During 2011, we successfully increased rents and saw improvement year-over-year each quarter. We stayed disciplined of our costs and actually reduced expenses both on and offsite year-over-year. We upgraded our technology, implemented a new property operating system and redesigned the Aimco website, thereby, enhancing the customer experience. And we retained a high percentage of our resident base by the prioritization of customer service and customer satisfaction. 
We finished 2011 on a positive note, with Conventional Same Store fourth quarter NOI up 5.3% over the third quarter and up 5.8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by revenues being up 0.8% over the third quarter and up 3.3% year-over-year, while expenses were down 6.6% compared to the third quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Now for some additional context around the fourth quarter revenue numbers. Fourth quarter renewal rents were up 5.2%, and new lease rents were up 0.7% for a blended increase of 3%. In our target markets, which represent about 86% of our NOI, occupancy was stable and new lease rents were up to 1.6%. 
In our non-target markets, we focused on gaining occupancy and getting to a strong jump-off point for 2012. After some softening in the -- early in the fourth quarter, demand strengthened. And we've finished 2011 with high occupancy across the portfolio. 
Average daily occupancy increased each week during the November and December to the year end of 95.7%. For the full year 2011, Conventional Affordable Same Store NOI was up 5.9% driven by revenues being up 2.9% and expenses being down 1.8%. 
Now for 2012. We began the new year in good shape, thanks to solid 2011 leasing activity, which will contribute 2.1% to the 2012 revenue growth, substantially better than the 0.4% we started with in 2011. January is on track, finishing according to plan. We remain highly focused on cost control. The expected increase year-over-year in expenses is entirely due to higher property taxes and property insurance costs. Utility expense increases are reimbursed by our customers. And in the aggregate, all expenses will be flat or down year-over-year, driven by operational efficiencies. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the stellar work of my colleagues, particularly, Karyn Marasco and Kevin Mosher, the Area Vice Presidents of the East and West Property Operations. Proud to be part of a team so wholeheartedly dedicated to Aimco's vision. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss the 2012 guidance. Keith provided the 2011 highlights from operations, so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopments, balance sheet and financial results. 
John Bezzant and his Transactions team sold 151 properties in 2011. We sold 25 low-rate Conventional properties. These properties had an -- had average rents of $649 compared to our current portfolio today of $1,143. We also sold 45 Affordable properties, where our average ownership was 39%, and we continue to reduce the size of our third-party asset management activities to the sale of 81 NAPICO properties. The properties we retained have higher rents and higher expected rent and NOI growth. Importantly, capital replacement or CR spending is a smaller percentage of their revenue, and it's the case for lower-rent properties. 
As a result of the 2011 property sales, we expect free cash flow margin and AFFO to grow faster than NOI margin and FFO. 
Turning to redevelopment. Dan Matula and the team broke ground on our Pacific Bay Vistas redevelopment, started the first phase of our Lincoln Place redevelopment and established a pipeline of projects lined up for starts in 2012 and 2013. Just 3 of these properties are presently baked in, we do not expect the redevelopment activity to be near-term dilutive to FFO and AFFO. We do expect it to be accretive in 2013 and beyond. 
Regarding the balance sheet. Our coverage has improved during 2011 due to earnings growth and a net reduction in debt. EBITDA coverage of interest increased to 2.18:1 from 2.07:1. EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends also increased to 1.78:1 from 1.68:1. At detailed and supplemental schedule, 4 of our earnings release will reduce total leverage, which include preferred stock by $84 million. 
Patti Fielding in our team, we financed over $600 million of property debt maturing in the years 2011 through 2015 at rates averaging 4.9%. These loans mature on average in 9 years. Today, our property debt is helped by 46 insurance companies, pension funds, banks and other institutions in addition to the GSEs. Patti also increased our revolving credit facility, expanding the number of participants, ending the maturity dates to December 2016, inclusive of extension options and reducing its costs. In addition to lowering our total amount of preferred equity, we also issued a new class of preferred equity with a total equity coupon of 7%. Both these from the initial offering were used to redeem higher-cost preferred equity. 
The efforts of Keith, John, Dan, Patti and the entire Aimco team led the FFO up 11% year-over-year from 2010 and AFFO up by 5%. 
Turning to 2012, you'll find on Page 5 of our earnings release our detailed guidance for the full year 2012, as well as guidance for the first quarter. There's a lot of information there so rather than reading the schedule to everyone, I'll just point out a few key items. 
Projected full year FFO is $1.72 to $1.82 per share. At the midpoint, this is an increase of about 8% from our 2011 FFO of $1.64. AFFO is anticipated to be up about 21% from 2011. FFO growth is driven primarily by expected revenue growth and lower offsite costs. AFFO was up more due to the delevering effect of selling lower-rent assets that required similar amounts of capital replacement spending as the current portfolio. 
Our assumptions around operating results are as follows. Full year NOI growth for our Conventional Same Store portfolio is expected to be between 5.25% and 7.25%, with revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3%. Keith pointed out the expense increases are due almost entirely to anticipated increases in property taxes and property insurance. While utility and costs are also expected to increase, these increases will be offset by reimbursements from our customers. All other expense line items in the aggregate are expected to be flat or down. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we entered 2012 with $173 million of property debt maturities in the next 12 months, to give rate loss of $55 million of that amount, leaving us $118 million or about 2.5% of our total property debt remaining to refinance. 
Property debt amortization in 2012 will be $83 million or a little less than 2% of our property debt. We announced in our earnings release that we entered into an agreement to transfer asset management of our NAPICO portfolio effective February 6 and to sell our minority interest in the portfolio to the new asset manager upon satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect the sale to close later in the second half of 2012. With this sale, we will liquidate all of our legacy asset management business. In 2011, we generated less than $0.01 of FFO from our NAPICO relationships. And it's anticipated that for 2012, we'll generate a similar amount of FFO. 
On Page 4 of the earnings release, we discussed how we expect coverages to further improve during 2012 from our growth in operations and balance sheet activities. 
Annualizing our anticipated EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2012, we expect EBITDA coverage of interest expense to be approximately 2.5:1, EBITDA coverage of interest expense and preferred dividends to be approximately 2:1, debt to EBITDA of approximately 7.5x and debt and preferred equity EBITDA of approximately 9x. 
I'm happy to report that we are off to a good start in all of these areas, and we are looking forward to a successful year ahead. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

You'll note in our guidance we provided that we expect sequential NOI growth from our Conventional Same Store portfolio to be down at the midpoint about 3%. And that's mainly due to expenses. We do expect revenues to be up about $0.01, but we expect expenses to offset -- unfortunately, be down about $0.04. And that's just -- part of that is seasonal, as we go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, in terms of the utility costs. And part of that is it's been a very good expense quarter in the fourth quarter. Secondly, Eric, we had about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 of nonrecurring income, and we're not projecting any nonrecurring income in the first quarter. That's another $0.02 going down for us. That gets you from our $0.41 to about $0.36, and there's much other small things that net out about $0.01 being down. So that's how we expect to end up at $0.35 at the midpoint for the first quarter 2012. Regarding what happens then, Eric, and for the rest of you, I don't want to get ahead of myself from providing quarterly guidance going forward, but as you can see from what we're expecting from revenue growth and where we expect expense to be in NOI for our whole portfolio, we do expect that operations can kick some strong contribution in the year for us as we finish out 2012. And then you also note in our guidance, we did provide guidance for nonrecurring revenues of about $6 million, which is a little bit more back-end weighted in our numbers, and that's how we see our FFO contribution ramp-up in the second, third and fourth quarter."

The Asset Management portfolio had virtually no impact on the dilution. In 2011, we earned about $0.01 or a little bit less than $0.01 from the activities from NAPICO, and it's a similar amount in 2012, as we are expecting that to be in our numbers",224,"Sure. The Asset Management portfolio had virtually no impact on the dilution. In 2011, we earned about $0.01 or a little bit less than $0.01 from the activities from NAPICO, and it's a similar amount in 2012, as we are expecting that to be in our numbers for most of the year. So I don't want to talk about too much about what would happen in the future other than the fact that it's only $0.01 in 2012, so it won't have a big difference. I think it's important, Eric, to point out -- you're right to point out in our numbers that you see that there's a dilution from asset sales of $0.13. But offsetting that is the reduction in expenses across the organization of $0.09. So on state, it sounds like our sell activity is quite dilutive, but we save a lot of money as we simplify the company, we take out costs, and we reduce our scale. And when you really net those 2 numbers, you can see that even with all the asset sells we've had, it hasn't been that dilutive for us on an overall basis. And going forward, we would expect something similar with the sales that we're contemplating in 2012. And the fact is we contemplate those sales, we have the opportunity to continue to save costs."

And in fact, in our target portfolios, we're at the top end of that.

But without providing guidance, Dave, to what's going to happen in the second, third and fourth quarters, specifically around renewal and lease rates, we do expect for the year that on a blended basis, we are going to be north of 5% on those. And as you can see from our numbers in the fourth quarter, we are there already for renewals, but it will be a lot of hard work to make sure we stay there for renewals. Let's hope that we do even better. And as you saw in our numbers during 2011, we had a pretty big spike in new lease rates as we got into the summer peak and season and then trended down, which I think was very similar to almost everyone in the industry. I'm not within the 2012 to look exactly like that, but it will be surprising if they have try to get it similar to that."

On the Affordable, we expect Affordable to be up -- Affordable Same Store up about -- from flat to up 1%. It's mainly driven by a revenue increase but a little less of an increase we saw in 2011 because we had some larger Affordable projects that had the rents or 5-year rents suddenly come up, and we got a nice bump. We're not going to see that in 2012. On net expenses, behave similarly in the Affordable portfolio, maybe a little bit more growth than we have in our Conventional portfolio. So Affordable will be up 0 to 1%, the Affordable Same Store portfolio. Real estate tax is embedded in our guidance, and the assumption is real estate taxes will increase between 5% and 6% and that' for the Conventional Same Store portfolio year-over-year. Within that number, Mike, 3.5% of the 5% to 6% is due to our expectation that both assessment in our tax rates are going to go up year-over-year. The other part then -- the part that's not the 3.5%, so roughly the 1.5% to 2.5%, that increase is due to the fact that we do expect we'll have less successful appeals on buyer taxes in 2012 than we had in 2011. So again, real estate taxes, embedded in our guidance, we're assuming to go up 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. Finally, with the Asset Management business. That's only going to contribute about $0.01 to us overall in 2012. Basically, the revenues almost offset the expenses for that business. And then actually that business is something that's taxed in our TRF as well. There's a tax expense associated with any profits from that. So we basically expect that revenues we generated before taxes are offset more or less by expenses to run those assets. And then there's a minor tax expense associated with those to bring it down to a little bit less than $0.01."

So I'm happy to take it offline with you to provide you some more details on how we get to the $0.13, but the safe way is to just describe it, the sales from 2011, we had a big bunch of close in December, so those are going to be quite dilutive to us because we have almost full year earnings of those in 2011. The sales in 2012 are assumed to be, and as John talked about, not quite ratable, but they will be spread out through the year. And based on our expectations for what we would sell to that from a cap rate, the math just worked out to be $0.13. But I just, unfortunately, I don't have it in front of me exactly how much is related to '11 and '12, but I'm happy to share that with you offline."

I'd like to take a few minutes at the beginning just to talk about the big picture.

I'd like to take a few minutes at the beginning just to talk about the big picture. 
The apartment business was good last year, and I think it will be as good or better this year. Demographics remain strongly positive, and the economy seems to be slowly recovering. And I'm pretty sure that 2012 will be a very solid year for Aimco. About half of our expected rent growth is already in the bank from leases made last year and so far this year just waiting to earn in. Our renewal business remains quite steady, with more than half of our customers renewing their leases at rents up 5% and more. In most markets, we enjoyed steady consumer demand for new leases, pushing up average daily occupancy and producing higher rents.
Our portfolio is good and getting better. It is more and more concentrated in the most desirable markets, with higher rents and greater expected rent growth. Last year, average rents were up 9% to more than $1,140. This year, we expect average rents to be up another $120 or 10%, more than $1,260. About half of that increase in average rents will come from rent growth, and about half will come from the sale of properties with lower rents. 
We apply the same selling discipline to our Affordable portfolio, where we plan to sell 60 Affordable properties this year, reducing our allocation to the Affordable business to less than 10% of net asset value. 
On the buy side, we expect to make at least $200 million of property acquisitions, primarily by buying out limited partners in 11 partnerships that own 19 properties. We've already closed on 4 of these transactions, and we expect to close 3 more this month. We like partnerships acquisitions because we already operate the real estate and know it well. Partnership acquisitions are especially accretive where we can eliminate overhead costs. For example, all 7 of the transactions that we closed in January or expect to close in February are public partnerships, with all the costs of SEC reporting, required audits, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and so on, and that's a lot of costs to eliminate. So that's it. After this year, we'll be largely done with a decade of partnership acquisitions, and we will enjoy a simpler, more transparent, lower-cost business. So we're actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities, especially where we see that our operating and redevelopment skills can add value and enhance returns. 
Even as we upgrade our portfolio by selling weaker properties, we are also adding higher-rent, better-located properties through redevelopment. Over the next few years, redevelopment will be an important contributor to improve portfolio quality and to faster rent growth. We expect to have 8 redevelopments underway this year: 4 in coastal California and 4 others in Seattle, Chicago and Philadelphia. We expect to spend more than $400 million on these properties over the next 2 years or so with current returns on untrended rents greater than 7% and unlevered internal rates of return greater than 10%. 
Three: Treetops, which is now known as Pacific Bay Vistas, Lincoln Place and Madera Vista, are currently vacant. So the return to service of more than 1,200 units, with target rents over $2,400, will upgrade our portfolio and be especially accretive. Behind these, we have a deep pipeline of other good redevelopment opportunities for future years. 
We remain focused on simplifying our business and reducing costs. As I mentioned earlier, closing out 11 more property partnerships will save legal, accounting and other overhead costs. We've also agreed to sell NAPICO, a legacy asset management business, in a management buyout. While the final closing will be later this year after conditions are satisfied and regulatory approvals are received, overhead savings are already being realized. So once more, Aimco offsite costs will be down year-over-year this year by another 12% or $12 million. 
The Aimco balance sheet is liquid and safe. Our business is self-funding with ample liquidity, including a new $500 million unused revolving line of credit with an extended term and reduced pricing. We have limited near-term refunding obligations, largely fixed interest rates and essentially no debt with recourse to income. 
With property income increasing, retained earnings supplies to amortized property debt and opportunistic redemption of high-cost preferred stocks, we expect balance sheet leverage to come down over the next few years. For example, we expect the ratio of EBITDA to interest to be about 2.5:1 by the fourth quarter of the year. We expect the ratio of debt to EBITDA to be less than 7.5:1 by year end. 
In sum, we have a favorable environment, a clear plan and a veteran team that works well together. We expect 2012 to be a year of steady progress across all metrics. With this in mind, the Aimco board of directors voted yesterday to increase the common stock dividend by 50% to the annual rate of $0.72 per share.

And I'm exceptionally proud of the accomplishments of the team that I'm fortunate to lead. During 2011, we successfully increased rents and saw improvement year-over-year each quarter. We stayed disciplined about costs and actually reduced expenses both on and offsite year-over-year. We upgraded our technology, implemented a new property operating system and redesigned the Aimco website, thereby, enhancing the customer experience. And we retained a high percentage of our resident base by the prioritization of customer service and customer satisfaction. 
We finished 2011 on a positive note with Conventional Same Store fourth quarter NOI up 5.3% over the third quarter and up 5.8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by revenues being up 0.8% over the third quarter and up 3.3% year-over-year, while expenses were down 6.6% compared to the third quarter and down 1% year-over-year. 
Now for some additional context around the fourth quarter revenue numbers. Fourth quarter renewal rents were up 5.2%, and new lease rents were up 0.7% for a blended increase of 3%. In our target markets, which represent about 86% of our NOI, occupancy was stable and new lease rents were up 1.6%. 
In our non-target markets, we focused on gaining occupancy and getting to a strong jump-off point for 2012. After some softening in the -- early in the fourth quarter, demand strengthened. And we finished 2011 with high occupancy across the portfolio.  
Average daily occupancy increased each week during the November and December to the year end of 95.7%. For the full year 2011, Conventional Affordable Same Store NOI was up 5.9% driven by revenues being up 2.9% and expenses being down 1.8%. 
Now for 2012. We began the new year in good shape, thanks to solid 2011 leasing activity, which will contribute 2.1% to the 2012 revenue growth, substantially better than the 0.4% we started with in 2011. January is on track, finishing according to plan. We remain highly focused on cost control. The expected increase year-over-year in expenses is entirely due to higher property taxes and property insurance costs. Utility expense increases are reimbursed by our customers. And in the aggregate, all expenses will be flat or down year-over-year, driven by operational efficiencies. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the stellar work of my colleagues, particularly, Karyn Marasco and Kevin Mosher, the Area Vice Presidents of the East and West Property Operations. Proud to be part of a team so wholeheartedly dedicated to Aimco's vision. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss 2012 guidance. Keith provided 2011 highlights from operations, so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopments, balance sheet and financial results. John Bezzant and his Transac",938,"Thanks, Keith. I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss 2012 guidance. Keith provided 2011 highlights from operations, so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopments, balance sheet and financial results. 
John Bezzant and his Transactions team sold 151 properties in 2011. They sold 25 low-rated Conventional properties. These properties had an -- had average rents of $649 compared to our current portfolio today of $1,143. We also sold 45 Affordable properties, where our average ownership was 39%, and we continue to reduce the size of our third-party asset management activities to the sale of 81 NAPICO properties. The properties we retained have higher rents and higher expected rent and NOI growth. Importantly, capital replacement or CR spending is a smaller percentage of their revenue and is the case for lower-rent properties. 
As a result of the 2011 property sales, we expect free cash flow margin and AFFO to grow faster than NOI margin and FFO. 
Turning to redevelopment. Dan Matula and the team broke ground on our Pacific Bay Vistas redevelopment, started the first phase of our Lincoln Place redevelopment and have established a pipeline of projects lined up for starts in 2012 and 2013. Because 3 of these properties are presently vacant, we do not expect the redevelopment activity to be near-term dilutive to FFO and AFFO. We do expect it to be accretive in 2013 and beyond. 
Regarding the balance sheet. Our coverage has improved during 2011 due to earnings growth and a net reduction in debt. EBITDA coverage of interest increased to 2.18:1 from 2.07:1. EBITDA coverage of interest in preferred dividends also increased to 1.78:1 from 1.68:1. A detailed and supplemental Schedule 4 of our earnings release will reduce total leverage, which includes preferred stock, by $84 million. 
Patti Fielding and her team refinanced over $600 million of property debt maturing in the years 2011 through 2015 at rates averaging 4.9%. These loans mature on average in 9 years. Today, our property debt is helped by 46 insurance companies, pension funds, banks and other institutions in addition to the GSEs. Patti also increased our revolving credit facility, expanding the number of participants, ending the maturity dates to December 2016, inclusive of extension options and reducing its cost. In addition to lowering our total amount of preferred equity, we also issued a new class of preferred equity with a total -- with a coupon of 7%. Proceeds from this initial offering were used to redeem higher-cost preferred equity. 
The efforts of Keith, John, Dan, Patti and the entire Aimco team led to FFO up 11% year-over-year from 2010 and AFFO up by 5%. 
Turning to 2012, you'll find on Page 5 of our earnings release our detailed guidance for the full year 2012, as well as guidance for the first quarter. There's a lot of information there, so rather than reading the schedule to everyone, I'll just point out a few key items. 
Projected full year FFO is $1.72 to $1.82 per share. At the midpoint, this is an increase of about 8% from our 2011 FFO of $1.64. AFFO is anticipated to be up about 21% from 2011. FFO growth is driven primarily by expected revenue growth in lower offsite costs. AFFO was up more due to the levering effect of selling lower-rent assets that required similar amounts of capital replacement spending as the current portfolio. 
Our assumptions around operating results are as follows. Full year NOI growth for our Conventional Same Store portfolio is expected to be between 5.25% and 7.25%, with revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3%. Keith pointed out expense increases are due almost entirely to anticipated increases in property taxes and property insurance. While utility costs are also expected to increase, these increases will be offset by reimbursements from our customers. All other expense line items in the aggregate are expected to be flat or down. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we entered 2012 with $173 million of property debt maturities in the next 12 months. We have rate-locked $55 million of that amount, leaving us $118 million or about 2.5% of our total property debt remaining to refinance. 
Property debt amortization in 2012 will be $83 million or a little less than 2% of our property debt. We announced in our earnings release that we entered into an agreement to transfer asset management of our NAPICO portfolio effective February 6 and to sell our minority interest in the portfolio to the new asset manager upon satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect the sale to close later in the second half of 2012. With this sale, we will have liquidated all of our legacy asset management business. In 2011, we generated less than $0.01 of FFO from our NAPICO relationship. And it's anticipated that for 2012, we'll generate a similar amount of FFO. 
On Page 4 of the earnings release, we discuss how we expect coverages to further improve during 2012 from our growth in operations and balance sheet activities. 
Annualizing our anticipated EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2012, we expect EBITDA coverage of interest expense to be approximately 2.5:1, EBITDA coverage of interest expense and preferred dividends to be approximately 2:1, debt to EBITDA of approximately 7.5x and debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of approximately 9x. 
I'm happy to report that we are off to a good start in all of these areas, and we are looking forward to a successful year ahead. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

Eric, this Ernie, and I'll walk you through the details on that. You'll note in our guidance we provided that we expect sequential NOI growth from our Conventional Same Store portfolio to be down at the midpoint about 3%. And that's mainly due to expenses. We do expect revenues to be up about $0.01, but we expect expenses to offset -- unfortunately, be down about $0.04. And that's just -- part of that is seasonal, as we go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, in terms of the utility costs. And part of that is just we had a very good expense quarter in the fourth quarter. Secondly, Eric, we had about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 of nonrecurring income, and we're not projecting any nonrecurring income in the first quarter. That's another $0.02 going down for us. That gets you from our $0.41 to about $0.36, and there's a bunch of other small things that net out to about $0.01 being down. So that's how we expect to end up at $0.35 at the midpoint for the first quarter 2012. Regarding what happens then, Eric, for the rest of the year, I don't want to get ahead of myself and provide quarterly guidance going forward, but as you can see from what we're expecting from revenue growth and where we expect expenses to be in NOI for our whole portfolio, we do expect that operations to kick some strong contribution into gear for us as we finish out 2012. And then you also know in our guidance, we did provide guidance for nonrecurring revenues of about $6 million, which is a little bit more back-end weighted in our numbers, and that's how we’ll see our FFO contribution ramp up in the second, third and fourth quarter."

In 2011, we earned about $0.01 or a little bit less than $0.01 from the activities from NAPICO, and it's a similar amount in 2012, as we are expecting that to be in our numbers for most of the year. So I don't want to talk about too much about what would happen for the future years, other than the fact that it's only $0.01 in 2012, so it won't have a big difference. I think it's important, Eric, to point out -- you're right to point out in our numbers that you see that there's a dilution from asset sales of $0.13. But offsetting that is the reduction in expenses across the organization of $0.09. So on state, it sounds like our sale activity is quite dilutive, but we save a lot of money as we simplify the company, we take out costs, and we reduce our scale. And when you really net those 2 numbers, you can see that even with all the asset sales we've had, it hasn't been that dilutive for us on an overall basis. And going forward, we would expect something similar with the sales that we're contemplating in 2012. And the fact is as we contemplate those sales, we have the opportunity to continue to save costs."

Keep in mind, we're not just solving for maximum new lease pricing or maximum renewal pricing. It's also a big component of this within occupancy as well. And we grew occupancy more in the fourth quarter than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the October call. Keith talked about it really is kind of a tale of 2 portfolios for us in terms of the -- our target market portfolio and our non-target market portfolio, and Keith addressed that. And we did see that the pricing fell off a little bit more in the non-target markets, which makes about 14% of our NOI, but we grew occupancy significantly and that to put us in a strong position for starting 2012. On an overall basis, and I think similar to what other folks have been reporting for new lease rates in the fourth quarter, our numbers on an aggregate basis were about where those folks were. And in fact, in our target portfolios, it was toward the top end of that. That's carried over into January, where we see things get modestly better, but we haven't seen any spike in new lease rates from where they are at today. But without providing guidance, Dave, to what's going to happen in the second, third and fourth quarters, specifically around renewal and new lease rates, we do expect for the year that on a blended basis, we’re going to be north of 5% on those. And as you can see from our numbers in the fourth quarter, we are there already for renewals, but it will be a lot of hard work to make sure we stay there for renewals and, hopefully, do even better. And as you saw in our numbers during 2011, we had a pretty big spike in new lease rates as we got into the summer peaking season and then trended down, which I think was very similar to almost everyone in the industry. I'm not going to say that 2012 is going to play out exactly like that, but it wouldn’t be surprising if it has a trend similar to that."

That's mainly driven by a revenue increase but a little less of an increase than we saw in 2011 because we had some larger Affordable projects that had the rents -- their 5-year rents studies [ph] come up, and we got a nice bump. We're not going to see that in 2012. And then expenses behaved similarly in the Affordable portfolio, maybe a little bit more growth than we have in our Conventional portfolio. So Affordable will be up 0% to 1%, the Affordable Same Store portfolio. Real estate tax is embedded in our guidance is an assumption is real estate taxes will increase between 5% and 6%, and that’s for the Conventional Same Store portfolio year-over-year. Within that number, Mike, 3.5% of the 5% to 6% is due to our expectation that both assessments and/or tax rates are going to go up year-over-year. The other part then -- the part that's not the 3.5%, so roughly the 1.5% to 2.5%, that increase is due to the fact that we do expect we'll have less successful appeals on prior year taxes in 2012 than we had in 2011. So again, real estate taxes, embedded in our guidance, we're assuming to go up 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. Finally, with the Asset Management business. That's only going to contribute about $0.01 to us overall in 2012. Basically, the revenues almost offset the expenses for that business. And then actually that business is something that's taxed. It’s in our TRF as well. There's a tax expense associated with any profits from that. So we basically expect that revenues we generate before taxes are offset more or less by expenses to run those assets. And then there's a minor tax expense associated with those that brings it down to a little bit less than $0.01."

We expect to close out public partnerships and private partnerships on the Conventional side, significantly reducing costs and increasing transparency.

Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good, with great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012 with FFO up 9% year-over-year and AFFO up 22%. More importantly, we are making steady progress on 4 long-term goals. First, our portfolio gets better and better. Our Conventional portfolio revenue per unit is now $1,263, up 9% year-over-year and up from $800 7 years ago,  a compounded annual growth rate of 7%. This gratifying increase is due to same store rent increases, higher rents on acquired and redeveloped properties and the sale of lower rent properties. We expect this process to steady improvement to continue as we concentrate our GAAP about in fewer submarkets with greater and more certain rent growth.
In addition, we are reducing our investment in our Affordable segment, falling 40 properties last year and expecting to sell another 60 properties this year. Our remaining business will be simpler and of higher quality. Second, we are ramping up our redevelopment activities. We began this year with 4 redevelopment underway and we have since started a fifth. We expect to start 5 more during the balance of the year. For all 10, we expect to spend about $400 million over the next 2 or 3 years. On completion, we expect rents on the redeveloped units on trended and at today's level average $2,200 or so. We expect free cash flow IRRs greater than 10% and cash and cash returns greater than 7%. Given that the average cap rates in these markets are about 4.5%, we expect to get great considerable value for our shareholders. These projects will also improve our portfolio quality and increase our average portfolio rents. We have a deep pipeline of similar opportunities, and we expect to start them in future years, market conditions permitting.
Third, we are working to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage while maintaining its nonrecourse long-duration and fixed-rate character. We expect to end this year with total leverage defined here as debt less preferred stock divided by annualized fourth quarter EBITDA equal to 8.7x. We are on track to meet our longer-term goal of 7x over the next 3 years or so, assuming only market growth in property income, amortization of property debt from retained earnings, contribution from completed redevelopment projects. We're also considering alternatives to accelerate both our portfolio of upgrading and our balance sheet delevering with the sale of properties that we would otherwise sell in 2013 and '14., with the use of proceeds to redeem our high-cost preferred stocks. Fourth, we continue to simplify our business and to reduce offsite costs. The previously reported we are on the contract to sell our seller Asset Management business later this year. As I just mentioned, we are reducing our Affordable line of business. We have eliminated 7 public partnerships during the first quarter and over the past 8 years, we have reduced property partnerships to 90%. This simplification supports lower offsite costs, improved management execution and greater transparency to our shareholders.
In sum business is good, we're working hard to take full advantage of the excellence of our market conditions, we're making solid progress to position Aimco for the longer term. For more detailed report on the first quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year and up 1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2011. We were pleased with our overall performance, particularly with first quarter sequential revenue growth driven by both improved rate and higher occupancy. Revenue growth is our top priority, and the commitment and focus of the team in the field is notably visible in our results. Staying on revenue for a moment. First quarter blended rates were up 3.4%, new leases up 2% and renewals up 5.1% and the lease to lease basis. Both new and renewal lease rates improved each month during the quarter and relative to the first quarter of 2011. Starting April, these REITs continued their positive momentum with blended rates up 5.2%, with new lease rates up 4.7% and renewal REITs up 5.6%, all the while April's average daily occupancy was 95.9%. May and June renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases, and July renewals are going out with 7% to 9% increases. Turnover was 45.2% for the quarter compared to 44.5% for the first quarter of 2011.
Our focus on customer retention continues to serve us well, not only because we achieve higher rent increases on our renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our cost down. We've not seen any material changes and reasons for move outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: Career moves at 23%, pricing at 19% and purchasing homes at 15%. While we always hate to lose a customer, we are replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We have 5,200 movements during the first quarter with an average income of $81,000, meeting income of $59,000 and an average rent income ratio of 21.8%.
First quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were down 40 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the mild weather and a tight control of payroll costs. The net result of all this is a year-over-year NOI growth of 6.8%. 
Let me provide some specific market color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% up to 12% year-over-year. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Phoenix, Orange County and Miami. In the middle of the pack with 4% to 5% growth range are consistent performers were Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. Rounding out the top 10 markets, those were the most upside were Los Angeles at 3.6%, San Diego at 3% and Chicago at 1.5%. Chicago is an area of opportunity in which we have underperformed the market. However, it has began to rebound during the last month as evidenced by our trailing 4-week new lease and renewal price increases at 6.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
As we expand our Bay Area portfolio, we are pleased to announce the Pacific Bay Vista leasing office will begin accepting applications this coming Tuesday. This marks the addition of 308 units in our top-performing market. With all that said, we are building upon the first quarter success with a solid April, which sets us up well for the second quarter and into the peak leasing season. With great things to our team for strong start to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activity, balance sheet targets and finally I will provide a guidance update.

Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activity, balance sheet targets and finally I will provide a guidance update. Starting with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.03 from property operations, $0.01 driven both by lower utility costs from the mild winter and reduced personnel costs to assess the result of timing of expenses, which we expect now to incur in the second and third quarters, $0.01 due to the lower offsite costs and $0.01 from other items.
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties with about 1,500 units, including 3 low rate Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 6%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $753 compared to our portfolio today of $1,253. We also sold 6 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.7%.
In March, we acquired a 488-unit property located in Phoenix for $59 million, $29 million of that in place. Our parties revenue per unit is approximately $1,110 and dollars and it's rents are approximately 47% higher than the local market average. During the quarter, we also acquired the remaining partnership interest in 7 consolidated real estate partnerships that own 13 properties. Fair value of the real estate corresponding to these interests totaled $124 million before property debt. Acquisition cost was $38 million. 
As redevelopment activity, we expect to have 10 active redevelopment projects in 2012. We continue construction activity at our $94 million redevelopments of Pacific Bay Vistas at San Bernardino, California point. As Keith mentioned, we will start leasing activity next week, expect our first move in during the third quarter of this year. In the first quarter 2012, we began redevelopment of the Palazzo at Park La Brea located in West Los Angeles. Palazzo is a high end property in dis a great location. The customers looking for an even more unique experience and to address this we've commenced a $15 million program to further upgrade our 115-house units with even higher finish. House residence will also have exclusive access to a new rooftop patio and lounge area. Delivery of amenities is the first penthouse units is expected in the third quarter of this year.
The complete 2 smaller projects in South Florida during 2012. We are meeting 6 projects to include 1 each in Seattle, San Francisco and Chicago, 2 in Center City Philadelphia, and we expect to begin Phase II of our redevelopment point in place in Venice, California. One of the company's is was completed in April, and residents started to move into these completed units. We expect to invest a total $400 million in these 10 projects over the next 2 to 3 years and current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rates of return in excess of 10%.
We plan to invest $125 million to $150 million during 2012 in a deep pipeline of opportunity to exist within our portfolio allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year. 
Regarding the balance sheet, during the first quarter we provided leverage targets that we expect to meet by 2015. Specifically we noted our goal to have debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA less than 7x EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. As a reminder, we expect our debt before equity to EBITDA coverage to be at 8.7 x by year-end. Third-party NOI projections for the years 2013 through 2015, we expect coverages to improve by almost a full turn to approximately 7.8x by the end of 2015. Production of debt through scheduled amortization and earning from our redevelopment activities will improve coverages further to about 7x by the end of 2015. 
Our brief case of continued revenue growth, property amortization and our for redevelopment activities gets us to our target by the end of 2015. That said, we are looking for opportunities to accelerate reaching our targets.
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to the range of $1.76 to $1.84 per share and FFO of $1.21 to $1.31 per share. We're increasing full year guidance expense on same-store net operating income at 25 basis points to a range of 5.5% to 7.5%. Increasing Conventional Same Store net operating income guidance is driven by a decrease in our expected expense growth, 2.25% to 2.75%, a 25-basis point decrease at the midpoint. We are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year of 4.5% to 5.5% increase.
Affordable Same Store NOI guidance is increased by 50 basis points to a range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6.75% basis points percent, a 50-basis point increase. Higher NOI expectations are driven primarily by better than expected first quarter results. The second quarter pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.40 to $0.44 per share, with the year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. Second quarter conventional same store NOI is projected to be flat to up 1% compared to the first quarter. We do expect that revenues will be up sequentially about 1.5%.
Before we take questions, I would like to point out that we have added 2 new schedules to our financial supplements. First, we have added Schedule 16, which details conventional same-store property operating expense trends. Second, Schedule 10 has been added to provide disclosure related to our redevelopment activities. Also, to provide more disclosure and allow for meaningful comparisons with many of our peers, we provided both rental rate per unit and total revenue per unit in our earnings release. Operating results by market information we provided in our supplemental schedules include revenue per unit information. Approximately 10% of our rental revenues come from sources such as utility reimbursements, parking and storage.
Keith reported in his remarks the average income of our customers that moved in during the first quarter. In addition, he provided our calculated rent to income ratio of 21.8%. I wanted to provide some background on how we calculated the 21.8% amount. In reviewing our collected data, we noted that we had some significant outliers bit regards to very high household income properties like The Palazzo, Flamingo and Calvin Beach club. We do not want those outliers to skew our calculated rent to income metric when aggregating our entire portfolio. We calculated our rent to income metric by taking each apartment homes ratio, adding them together and then dividing by the number of homes. With low rent to income percentage of some of our high-end properties do not that overwhelmed the overall results and blended it with be the rest of the portfolio. With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's turn it over to you for the first question, please."

I'll take that question for you. I think there's a couple of things to consider. The first is that I want to point out that while we have the least that we were we move to you, we've always had a professional revenue management system as part of our operating platform. And so we certainly believe that yield star has helped us to be able to have some simplicities in using that system. We wouldn't really contribute that as being the direct result of having some real acceleration. As you look at the A, Bs and Cs, that's a different topic. And so really we look at new leases being the barometer of kind of how they're performing. And so at the moment, what we're seeing is about 140 basis point spread between the As and the Cs. Of note, what's a little bit interesting is we're starting to see some acceleration with the Cs, which previously had been really driven by the As. And so of course that's one of the benefits of having it a blended portfolio like we have. And we're pleased to see that there's some bouncing balancing out happening."

Plantation Gardens has been undergoing renovation for some time since 2011 and we're getting to the point where it's actually turning were we have a minimal amount of redev drag on that, I said minimal because it's a smaller project, and the good news is that will start contributing NOI positive for us. And then finally, Palazzo will have some drag, it's a smaller project, there is a decent amount of those dollars spend on amenities and exterior works that won't take units out of place. On a project like Collazo under little bit of redev drag. Now for the projects we have going on in the future, there will be some disruption in terms of redev being done on the terms, in terms of taking a little longer because of that, and as those projects come out and we get more specific information on those, we can provide definitely some color as to the redev drag. we used to talk about redev drag in the program we're spending $350 million a year, pretty significant negative contribution to our earnings.

Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. With great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012, with FFO up 9% year-over-year and",580,"Thank you, Lisa, and good day to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. With great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012, with FFO up 9% year-over-year and AFFO up 22%. More importantly, we are making steady progress on 4 long-term goals. 
First, our portfolio gets better and better. Our Conventional portfolio revenue per unit is now $1,263, up 9% year-over-year and up from $800 7 years ago, a compounded annual growth rate of 7%. This gratifying increase is due to same-store rent increases, higher rents on acquired and redeveloped properties and the sale of lower rent properties. We expect this process of steady improvement to continue as we concentrate our capital in fewer submarkets with greater and more certain rent growth. In addition, we are reducing our investment in our Affordable segment, selling 40 properties last year and expecting to sell another 60 properties this year. Our remaining business will be simpler and of higher quality. 
Second, we are ramping up our redevelopment activities. We began this year with 4 redevelopments underway and we have since started the fifth. We expect to start 5 more during the balance of the year. For all 10, we expect to spend about $400 million over the next 2 or 3 years. On completion, we expect rents on the redeveloped units on trended and at today's levels to average $2,200 or so. We expect free cash flow IRRs greater than 10% and cash and cash returns greater than 7%. Given that the average cap rates in these markets are about 4.5%, we expect they could create considerable value for our shareholders. These projects will also improve our portfolio quality and increase our average portfolio rents. We have a deep pipeline of similar opportunities, and we expect to start them in future years, market conditions permitting.
Third, we are working to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage while maintaining its nonrecourse long-duration and fixed-rate character. We expect to end this year with total leverage, defined here as debt plus preferred stock divided by annualized fourth quarter EBITDA equal to 8.7x. We are on track to meet our longer-term goal of 7x over the next 3 years or so, assuming only market growth in property income, amortization of property debt from retained earnings and contribution from completed redevelopment projects. We are also considering alternatives to accelerate both our portfolio upgrading and our balance sheet delevering by the sale of properties that we would otherwise sell in 2013 and '14, with the use of proceeds to redeem our high-cost preferred stocks. 
Fourth, we continue to simplify our business and to reduce offsite costs. As previously reported, we're under contract to sell our Asset Management business later this year. As I've just mentioned, we are reducing our affordable line of business. We have eliminated 7 public partnerships during the first quarter. And over the past 8 years, we have reduced property partnerships by 90%. This simplification supports lower offsite costs, improved management execution and greater transparency to our shareholders.
In sum, business is good. We're working hard to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions, and we're making solid progress to position Aimco for the longer term. 
For more detailed report on the first quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year and up 1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2011. We were pleased with our overall performance, and particularly with first quarter sequential revenue growth driven by both improved rate and higher occupancy. Revenue growth is our top priority, and the commitment and focus of the team in the field is notably visible in our results. 
Staying on revenue for a moment. First quarter blended rates were up 3.4%, with new leases up 2% and renewals up 5.1% on a lease-to-lease basis. Both new and renewal lease rates improved each month during the quarter and relative to the first quarter of 2011. 
During April, these rates continued their positive momentum, with blended rates up 5.2%, with new lease rates up 4.7% and renewal rates up 5.6%, all while April's average daily occupancy was 95.9%. May and June renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases, and July renewals are going out with 7% to 9% increases. Turnover was 45.2% for the quarter compared to 44.5% for the first quarter of 2011.
Our focus on customer retention continues to serve us well, not only because we achieved higher rent increases on our renewal rents but also because it allows us to keep our cost down. We have not seen any material changes and reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters, with the top 3 reasons being: Career moves at 23%, pricing at 19% and purchasing homes at 15%. 
While we always hate to lose a customer, we are replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 5,200 movements during the first quarter with an average income of $81,000, a median income of $59,000 and an average rent income ratio of 21.8%.
First quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were down 40 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the mild weather and a tight control of payroll costs. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 6.8%.
Let me provide some specific market color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% up to 12% year-over-year. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Phoenix, Orange County and Miami. In the middle of the pack with 4% to 5% growth range, our consistent performers were Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. 
Rounding out the top 10 markets, those with the most upside were Los Angeles at 3.6%, San Diego at 3% and Chicago at 1.5%. Chicago is an area of opportunity in which we have underperformed the market. However, it has began to rebound during the last month as evidenced by our trailing 4-week new lease and renewal price increases at 6.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
As we expand our Bay Area portfolio, we are pleased to announce the Pacific Bay Vista leasing office will begin accepting applications this coming Tuesday. This marks the addition of 308 units in our top-performing market. 
With all that said, we are building upon our first quarter success with a solid April, which sets us up well for the second quarter and into the peak leasing season. And with great things to our team on field [ph] for a strong start to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"
336458,183827290,298329,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. Starting with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.0",1173,"Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
Starting with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.03 from property operations, with $0.01 driven both by lower utility costs from the mild winter and reduced personnel costs; and $0.02 the result of timing of expenses, which we expect now to incur in the second and third quarters; $0.01 due to lower offsite costs and $0.01 from other items.
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties with about 1,500 units, including 3 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 6%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $753 compared to our portfolio today of $1,253. We also sold 6 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.7%.
In March, we acquired a 488-unit property located in Phoenix for $69 million, with $29 million of debt in place. The property's revenue per unit is approximately $1,110 and dollars, and its rents are approximately 47% higher than the local market average. 
During the quarter, we also acquired the remaining partnership interest in 7 consolidated real estate partnerships that own 13 properties. The fair value of the real estate corresponding to these interests totaled $124 million before property debt. Our acquisition cost was $38 million.
As to redevelopment activity, we expect to have 10 active redevelopment projects in 2012. We continue construction activity at our $94 million redevelopments of Pacific Bay Vistas at San Bruno, California point. As Keith mentioned, we will start leasing activities next week, and expect our first move-in during the third quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter of 2012, we began redevelopment of The Palazzo at Park La Brea, located in West Los Angeles. The Palazzo is a high-end property in a great location. Our customers are looking for an even more unique experience. And to address this, we've commenced a $15 million program to further upgrade our 115 penthouse units to an even higher finish. Penthouse residence will also have exclusive access to a new rooftop patio and lounge area. Delivery of amenities in the first penthouse unit is expected in the third quarter of this year.
We anticipate completing 2 smaller projects in South Florida during 2012. The remaining 6 projects include 1 each in Seattle, San Francisco and Chicago; 2 in Center City Philadelphia, and we expect to begin phase 2 of our redevelopment of Lincoln place in Venice, California. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and have residents started to move into these completed units. 
We expect to invest a total $400 million in these 10 projects over the next 2 to 3 years, with current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rates of return in excess of 10%.
We plan to invest $125 million to $150 million during 2012, and a deep pipeline of opportunities exist within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year.
Regarding the balance sheet, during the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expect to meet by 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA at less than 7x, and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. As a reminder, we expect our debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA coverage to be at 8.7x by year end. 
Using third-party NOI projections for the years 2013 through 2015, we expect coverages to improve by almost a full turn to approximately 7.8x by the end of 2015. Production of debt through scheduled amortizations and earning from our redevelopment activities would improve coverages further to about 7x by the end of 2015.
So our base case of continued revenue growth, property debt amortization entered in redevelopment activities gets us to our target by the end of 2015. That said, we are looking for opportunities to accelerate reaching our target.
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.76 to $1.84 per share and AFFO of $1.21 to $1.31 per share. We are increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store net operating income by 25 basis points to a range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The increase in Conventional Same Store net operating income guidance is driven by a decrease in our expected expense growth rate of 2.25% to 2.75%, a 25-basis point decrease at the midpoint. We are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year of 4.5% to 5.5% increase.
Affordable Same Store NOI guidance is increased by 50 basis points to a range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6.75%, a 50-basis point increase. Higher NOI expectations are driven primarily by better-than-expected first quarter results.
For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.40 to $0.44 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store NOI is projected to be flat to up 1% compared to first quarter. We do expect that revenues will be up sequentially about 1.5%.
Before we take questions, I would like to point out that we have added 2 new schedules to our financial supplement. First, we have added Schedule 16, which details Conventional Same Store property operating expense trends, and second, Schedule 10 has been added to provide expanded disclosure related to our redevelopment activities. 
Also, to provide more disclosure and allow for meaningful comparisons with many of our peers, we provided both rental rate per unit and total revenue per unit in our earnings release. The operating results by market information we provide in our supplemental schedules include revenue per unit information. Approximately 10% of our rental revenues come from sources such as utility reimbursements, parking and storage.
And Keith reported in his remarks the average income of our customers who moved in during the first quarter. In addition, he provided our calculated rent-to-income ratio of 21.8%. I wanted to provide some background on how we calculated the 21.8% amount. When reviewing our collected data, we noted that we had some significant outliers with regards to very high household income at properties like The Palazzo, Flamingo and Calhoun Beach Club. We did not want those outliers to skew our calculated rent to income metric when aggregating our entire portfolio. We've calculated our rent-to-income metric by taking each apartment home's ratio, adding them together and then dividing by the number of homes. So the low rent-to-income percentage of some of our high-end properties does not then overwhelm the overall results when blended that with the rest of the portfolio. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's turn it over to you for the first question, please."

I'll take that question for you. I think there's a couple of things to consider. The first is that I just -- I want to point out that while we have released that we were on -- we moved to YieldStar, we've always had a professional revenue management system as part of our operating platform. And so we certainly believe that YieldStar has helped us to be able to have some simplicities in using that system. We wouldn't really contribute that as being the direct result of having some real acceleration. As you look at the A, Bs and Cs, that's a different topic. And so really we look at new leases being the barometer of kind of how they're performing. And so at the moment, what we're seeing is about 140-basis point spread between the As and the Cs. Of note, what's a little bit interesting is we're starting to see some acceleration with the Cs, which previously had been really driven by the As. And so, of course, that's one of the benefits of having a blended portfolio like we have. And we're pleased to see that there's some balancing out happening."

But the overall amount of that is very small, well less than $100 million in terms of opportunities for us there, in terms of what we can bring in. And what I would tell you is we approach these private owners often, one, it's hard to find them; two, they don't have a lot of interest in it. So we engage in a dialogue and pick up a few units here and there. But for the most part, we only accomplish in the first quarter, there's not to be much more for us to talk about in terms of closing these partnership tenders and mergers, but we're pretty much there."

Three of the projects that we have that are listed on Schedule 10 are Lincoln Place, The Preserve at Marin and Pacific Bay Vistas that are empty projects. So for there, we'll have actually no NOI dilution and it will have only accretive impacts. Now of course, we'll capitalize and we'll divest interest as those things come online, but net-net that's going to be a positive contribution for us. There is no redev drag from those projects. And the other projects that we have listed on Schedule 10, Flamingo South Beach is actually from exterior work. There's not any units being taken down, so we'll have no redev drag from Flamingo South Beach. Plantation Gardens has been undergoing a renovation for some time since 2011, and we're getting to the point where it's actually turning were we have a minimal amount of redev drag on that. And I said minimal because it's a smaller project. And the good news is that will start contributing NOI positive for us. And then finally, Palazzo will have some drag. It's a smaller project. There is a decent amount of those dollars that are being spent on amenities and exterior works that won't take units out of -- in a sense, out of place. On a project like Palazzo, there will be a little bit of redev drag. Now for the projects we have going on in the future, there will be some disruption in terms of redev being done on the terms, in terms of taking a little longer because of that, and as those projects come out and we get more specific information on those, we can provide definitely some color as to the redev drag. What I think, Taylor, we used to talk about redev drag in the program where we're spending $350 million a year, it was a pretty significant negative contribution to our earnings. But with the process we have in place here, we're not going to be looking at those kind of numbers like we did back in 2006, 2007 and 2008."

Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. With great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012, with FFO up 9% year-over-year and AFFO up 22%. More importantly, we are making steady progress on 4 long-term goals. 
First, our portfolio gets better and better. Our Conventional portfolio revenue per unit is now $1,263, up 9% year-over-year and up from $800 7 years ago, a compounded annual growth rate of 7%. This gratifying increase is due to same-store rent increases, higher rents on acquired and redeveloped properties and the sale of lower rent properties. We expect this process of steady improvement to continue as we concentrate our capital in fewer submarkets with greater and more certain rent growth. In addition, we are reducing our investment in our Affordable segment, selling 40 properties last year and expecting to sell another 60 properties this year. Our remaining business will be simpler and of higher quality. 
Second, we are ramping up our redevelopment activities. We began this year with 4 redevelopments underway and we have since started a fifth. We expect to start 5 more during the balance of the year. For all 10, we expect to spend about $400 million over the next 2 or 3 years. On completion, we expect rents on the redeveloped units, un-trended and at today's levels to average $2,200 or so. We expect free cash flow IRRs greater than 10% and cash and cash returns greater than 7%. Given that the average cap rates in these markets are about 4.5%, we expect to get -- create considerable value for our shareholders. These projects will also improve our portfolio quality and increase our average portfolio rents. We have a deep pipeline of similar opportunities, and we expect to start them in future years, market conditions permitting.
Third, we are working to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage while maintaining its nonrecourse long-duration and fixed-rate character. We expect to end this year with total leverage, defined here as debt plus preferred stock divided by annualized fourth quarter EBITDA equal to 8.7x. We are on track to meet our longer-term goal of 7x over the next 3 years or so, assuming only market growth in property income, amortization of property debt from retained earnings and contribution from completed redevelopment projects. We are also considering alternatives to accelerate both our portfolio upgrading and our balance sheet delevering by the sale of properties that we would otherwise sell in 2013 and '14, with the use of proceeds to redeem our high-cost preferred stocks. 
Fourth, we continue to simplify our business and to reduce offsite costs. As previously reported, we're under contract to sell our Asset Management business later this year. As I've just mentioned, we are reducing our affordable line of business. We have eliminated 7 public partnerships during the first quarter. And over the past 8 years, we have reduced property partnerships by 90%. This simplification supports lower offsite costs, improved management execution and greater transparency to our shareholders.
In sum, business is good. We're working hard to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions, and we're making solid progress to position Aimco for the longer term. 
For a more detailed report on the first quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"
336458,183827290,298580,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. We’ve started out 2012 ahead of our expectations. Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year and up 1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2011.

Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year and up 1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2011. We were pleased with our overall performance, and particularly with first quarter sequential revenue growth driven by both improved rate and higher occupancy. Revenue growth is our top priority, and the commitment and focus of the team in the field is notably visible in our results. 
Staying on revenue for a moment. First quarter blended rates were up 3.4%, with new leases up 2% and renewals up 5.1% on a lease-to-lease basis. Both new and renewal lease rates improved each month during the quarter and relative to the first quarter of 2011. 
During April, these rates continued their positive momentum, with blended rates up 5.2%, with new lease rates up 4.7% and renewal rates up 5.6%, all while April's average daily occupancy was 95.9%. May and June renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases, and July renewals are going out with 7% to 9% increases. Turnover was 45.2% for the quarter compared to 44.5% for the first quarter of 2011.
Our focus on customer retention continues to serve us well, not only because we achieved higher rent increases on our renewal rents but also because it allows us to keep our cost down. We have not seen any material changes and reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters, with the top 3 reasons being: Career moves at 23%, pricing at 19% and purchasing homes at 15%. 
While we always hate to lose a customer, we are replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 5,200 move ins during the first quarter with an average income of $81,000, a median income of $59,000 and an average rent income ratio of 21.8%.
First quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were down 40 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the mild weather and a tight control of payroll costs. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 6.8%.
Let me provide some specific market color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% up to 12% year-over-year. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Phoenix, Orange County and Miami. In the middle of the pack with 4% to 5% growth range, our consistent performers were Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. 
Rounding out the top 10 markets, those with the most upside were Los Angeles at 3.6%, San Diego at 3% and Chicago at 1.5%. Chicago is an area of opportunity in which we have underperformed the market. However, it has begun to rebound during the last month as evidenced by our trailing 4-week new lease and renewal price increases at 6.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
As we expand our Bay Area portfolio, we are pleased to announce the Pacific Bay Vista leasing office will begin accepting applications this coming Tuesday. This marks the addition of 308 units in our top-performing market. 
With all that said, we are building upon our first quarter success with a solid April, which sets us up well for the second quarter and into the peak leasing season. And with great thanks to our team in the field for a strong start to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"
336458,183827290,298580,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. Beginning with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.",1173,"Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.03 from property operations, with $0.01 driven both by lower utility costs from the mild winter and reduced personnel costs; and $0.02 the result of timing of expenses, which we expect now to incur in the second and third quarters; $0.01 due to lower offsite costs and $0.01 from other items.
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties with about 1,500 units, including 3 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 6%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $753 compared to our portfolio today of $1,253. We also sold 6 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.7%.
In March, we acquired a 488-unit property located in Phoenix for $69 million, with $29 million of debt in place. The property's revenue per unit is approximately $1,110 and dollars, and its rents are approximately 47% higher than the local market average. 
During the quarter, we also acquired the remaining partnership interest in 7 consolidated real estate partnerships that own 13 properties. The fair value of the real estate corresponding to these interests totaled $124 million before property debt. Our acquisition cost was $38 million.
As to redevelopment activities, we expect to have 10 active redevelopment projects in 2012. We continue construction activity at our $94 million redevelopments of Pacific Bay Vistas at San Bruno, California. As Keith mentioned, we will start leasing activities next week, and expect our first move-in during the third quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter of 2012, we began redevelopment of The Palazzo at Park La Brea, located in West Los Angeles. The Palazzo is a high-end property in a great location. Our customers are looking for an even more unique experience. And to address this, we've commenced a $15 million program to further upgrade our 115 penthouse units to an even higher finish. Penthouse residence will also have exclusive access to a new rooftop patio and lounge area. Delivery of amenities in the first penthouse units is expected in the third quarter of this year.
We anticipate completing 2 smaller projects in South Florida during 2012. The remaining 6 projects include 1 each in Seattle, San Francisco and Chicago; 2 in Center City Philadelphia, and we expect to begin phase 2 of our redevelopment of Lincoln place in Venice, California. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and residents have started to move into these completed units. 
We expect to invest a total $400 million in these 10 projects over the next 2 to 3 years, with current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rates of return in excess of 10%.
We plan to invest $125 million to $150 million during 2012, and a deep pipeline of opportunities exist within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year.
Regarding the balance sheet, during the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expect to meet by 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA at less than 7x, and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. As a reminder, we expect our debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA coverage to be at 8.7x by year end. 
Using third-party NOI projections for the years 2013 through 2015, we expect coverages to improve by almost a full turn to approximately 7.8x by the end of 2015. Production of debt through scheduled amortizations and earn-in from our redevelopment activities would improve coverages further to about 7x by the end of 2015.
So our base case of continued revenue growth, property debt amortization and earn-in from redevelopment activities gets us to our target by the end of 2015. That said, we are looking for opportunities to accelerate reaching our target.
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.76 to $1.84 per share and AFFO of $1.21 to $1.31 per share. We are increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store net operating income by 25 basis points to a range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The increase in Conventional Same Store net operating income guidance is driven by a decrease in our expected expense growth rate of 2.25% to 2.75%, a 25-basis point decrease at the midpoint. We are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year of 4.5% to 5.5% increase.
Affordable Same Store NOI guidance is increased by 50 basis points to a range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6.75%, a 50-basis point increase. Higher NOI expectations are driven primarily by better-than-expected first quarter results.
For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.40 to $0.44 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store NOI is projected to be flat to up 1% compared to first quarter. We do expect that revenues will be up sequentially about 1.5%.
Before we take questions, I would like to point out that we have added 2 new schedules to our financial supplement. First, we have added Schedule 6b [ph] which details Conventional Same Store property operating expense trends, and second, Schedule 10 has been added to provide expanded disclosure related to our redevelopment activities. 
Also, to provide more disclosure and allow for meaningful comparisons with many of our peers, we provided both rental rate per unit and total revenue per unit in our earnings release. The operating results by market information we provide in our supplemental schedules include revenue per unit information. Approximately 10% of our rental revenues come from sources such as utility reimbursements, parking and storage.
Keith reported in his remarks the average income of our customers who moved in during the first quarter. In addition, he provided our calculated rent-to-income ratio of 21.8%. I wanted to provide some background on how we calculated the 21.8% amount. When reviewing our collected data, we noted that we had some significant outliers with regards to very high household income at properties like The Palazzo, Flamingo and Calhoun Beach Club. We did not want those outliers to skew our calculated rent to income metric when aggregating our entire portfolio. We've calculated our rent-to-income metric by taking each apartment home's ratio, adding them together and then dividing by the number of homes. So the low rent-to-income percentage at some of our high-end properties does not then overwhelm the overall results when blended this with the rest of the portfolio. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I’ll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

It's the specific submarkets they happen to be in and some various demographic measures within those submarkets. As it relates to the portfolio as a whole, we haven't, in some of the prior conferences, provided some detail on where portfolio rents will move. The anticipation is, is that -- they’ll move in accordance with the magnitude of what we actually execute, how's that? They're going up. And I think in terms of what to expect and when we will decide to pull the trigger, it will really be driven by pricing. We've got some very good execution this quarter in the properties that we sold and we will continue to look for good executions as we look forward."

And at the end of the day, roughly half of that is coming -- the increase from the prior year is coming from rental increases and roughly half is coming from the fact that we sold lower rate of sales. If we're successful in accelerating some sales, you'll see a similar acceleration with regards to the piece having to do with the sales and properties.

The first is that I just -- I want to point out that while we have released that we were on -- we moved to YieldStar, we've always had a professional revenue management system as part of our operating platform. And so we certainly believe that YieldStar has helped us to be able to have some simplicities in using that system. We wouldn't really contribute that as being the direct result of having some real acceleration. As you look at the A, Bs and Cs, that's a different topic. And so really we look at new leases being the barometer of kind of how they're performing. And so at the moment, what we're seeing is about 140-basis point spread between the As and the Cs. Of note, what's a little bit interesting is we're starting to see some acceleration with the Cs, which previously had been really driven by the As. And so, of course, that's one of the benefits of having a blended portfolio like we have. And we're pleased to see that there's some balancing out happening."

The affordable game plan really hasn't changed in that we expect to sell 60 Affordable assets this year, and if we do have the opportunity to maybe accelerate another 20 to 25 asset sales into this year. But then the proceeds that would be generated from that are pretty small, our ownership percentages are smaller on that and wouldn't have as much of a meaningful impact on use of proceeds to take out preferred equity. And then as Terry talked about in his prepared remarks, overall, longer-term, our expectation was to continue to see that more Affordable sales over the next few years. On the Conventional side, in terms of what the numbers are going to be, again, we're focused on the right economics, in getting what we want to get. And we're looking to do it. We're not committing that it's going happen. We're hopeful that it will happen. Just at this point, you raised the right point, Mike, that we would expect to sell about 5% to 10% of our assets or sorry our lowest-yield assets over the next couple of years.

So for there, we'll have absolutely no NOI dilution and it will have only accretive impacts. Now of course, we'll capitalize and we'll divest interest as those things come online, but net-net that's going to be a positive contribution for us. And there is no redev drag from those projects. And the other projects that we have listed on Schedule 10, Flamingo South Beach is actually some exterior work. There's not any units being taken down, so we'll have no redev drag from Flamingo South Beach. Plantation Gardens has been undergoing a renovation for some time since 2011, and we're getting to the point where it's actually turning where we had a minimal amount of redev drag on that. And I said minimal because it's a smaller project. And the good news is that will start contributing NOI positive for us. And then finally, Palazzo will have some drag. It's a smaller project. There is a decent amount of those dollars that are being spent on amenities and exterior works that won't take units out of -- in a sense, out of place. On a project like Palazzo, there will be a little bit of redev drag. Now for the projects we have going on in the future, there will be some disruption in terms of redev being done on the terms, and terms taking a little longer because of that, and as those projects come out and we get more specific information on those, we can provide definitely some color as to the redev drag. What I think, Taylor is when we used to talk about redev drag in the program where we're spending $350 million a year, it was a pretty significant negative contribution to our earnings. But with the projects we have in place here, we're not going to be looking at those kind of numbers like we did back in 2006, 2007 and 2008."

With great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012, with FFO up 9% year-over-year and",581,"Thank you, Lisa, and good day to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. With great thanks to my teammates all across Aimco, we are on track to meet or beat our guidance for 2012, with FFO up 9% year-over-year and AFFO up 22%. More importantly, we are making steady progress on 4 long-term goals. 
First, our portfolio gets better and better. Our Conventional portfolio revenue per unit is now $1,263, up 9% year-over-year and up from $800 7 years ago, a compounded annual growth rate of 7%. This gratifying increase is due to same-store rent increases, higher rents on acquired and redeveloped properties and the sale of lower rent properties. We expect this process of steady improvement to continue as we concentrate our capital in fewer submarkets with greater and more certain rent growth. In addition, we are reducing our investment in our Affordable segment, selling 40 properties last year and expecting to sell another 60 properties this year. Our remaining business will be simpler and of higher quality. 
Second, we are ramping up our redevelopment activities. We began this year with 4 redevelopments underway and we have since started a fifth. We expect to start 5 more during the balance of the year. For all 10, we expect to spend about $400 million over the next 2 or 3 years. On completion, we expect rents on the redeveloped units, un-trended and at today's levels to average $2,200 or so. We expect free cash flow IRRs greater than 10% and cash and cash returns greater than 7%. Given that the average cap rates in these markets are about 4.5%, we expect to get -- create considerable value for our shareholders. These projects will also improve our portfolio quality and increase our average portfolio rents. We have a deep pipeline of similar opportunities, and we expect to start them in future years, market conditions permitting.
Third, we are working to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage while maintaining its nonrecourse long-duration and fixed-rate character. We expect to end this year with total leverage, defined here as debt plus preferred stock divided by annualized fourth quarter EBITDA equal to 8.7x. We are on track to meet our longer-term goal of 7x over the next 3 years or so, assuming only market growth in property income, amortization of property debt from retained earnings and contribution from completed redevelopment projects. We are also considering alternatives to accelerate both our portfolio upgrading and our balance sheet delevering by the sale of properties that we would otherwise sell in 2013 and '14, with the use of proceeds to redeem our high-cost preferred stocks. 
Fourth, we continue to simplify our business and to reduce offsite costs. As previously reported, we're under contract to sell our Asset Management business later this year. As I've just mentioned, we are reducing our affordable line of business. We have eliminated 7 public partnerships during the first quarter. And over the past 8 years, we have reduced property partnerships by 90%. This simplification supports lower offsite costs, improved management execution and greater transparency to our shareholders.
In sum, business is good. We're working hard to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions, and we're making solid progress to position Aimco for the longer term. 
For a more detailed report on the first quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year and up 1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2011. We were pleased with our overall performance, and particularly with first quarter sequential revenue growth driven by both improved rate and higher occupancy. Revenue growth is our top priority, and the commitment and focus of the team in the field is notably visible in our results. 
Staying on revenue for a moment. First quarter blended rates were up 3.4%, with new leases up 2% and renewals up 5.1% on a lease-to-lease basis. Both new and renewal lease rates improved each month during the quarter and relative to the first quarter of 2011. 
During April, these rates continued their positive momentum, with blended rates up 5.2%, with new lease rates up 4.7% and renewal rates up 5.6%, all while April's average daily occupancy was 95.9%. May and June renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases, and July renewals are going out with 7% to 9% increases. Turnover was 45.2% for the quarter compared to 44.5% for the first quarter of 2011.
Our focus on customer retention continues to serve us well, not only because we achieved higher rent increases on our renewal rents but also because it allows us to keep our cost down. We have not seen any material changes and reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters, with the top 3 reasons being: Career moves at 23%, pricing at 19% and purchasing homes at 15%. 
While we always hate to lose a customer, we are replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 5,200 move ins during the first quarter with an average income of $81,000, a median income of $59,000 and an average rent income ratio of 21.8%.
First quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were down 40 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the mild weather and a tight control of payroll costs. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 6.8%.
Let me provide some specific market color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% up to 12% year-over-year. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Phoenix, Orange County and Miami. In the middle of the pack with 4% to 5% growth range, our consistent performers were Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. 
Rounding out the top 10 markets, those with the most upside were Los Angeles at 3.6%, San Diego at 3% and Chicago at 1.5%. Chicago is an area of opportunity in which we have underperformed the market. However, it has begun to rebound during the last month as evidenced by our trailing 4-week new lease and renewal price increases at 6.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
As we expand our Bay Area portfolio, we are pleased to announce the Pacific Bay Vista leasing office will begin accepting applications this coming Tuesday. This marks the addition of 308 units in our top-performing market. 
With all that said, we are building upon our first quarter success with a solid April, which sets us up well for the second quarter and into the peak leasing season. And with great thanks to our team in the field for a strong start to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"
336458,183827290,299556,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. Beginning with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.",1173,"Thanks, Keith. Today I'll report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet targets, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, first quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.03 from property operations, with $0.01 driven both by lower utility costs from the mild winter and reduced personnel costs; and $0.02 the result of timing of expenses, which we expect now to incur in the second and third quarters; $0.01 due to lower offsite costs and $0.01 from other items.
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties with about 1,500 units, including 3 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 6%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $753 compared to our portfolio today of $1,253. We also sold 6 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.7%.
In March, we acquired a 488-unit property located in Phoenix for $69 million, with $29 million of debt in place. The property's revenue per unit is approximately $1,110 and dollars, and its rents are approximately 47% higher than the local market average. 
During the quarter, we also acquired the remaining partnership interest in 7 consolidated real estate partnerships that own 13 properties. The fair value of the real estate corresponding to these interests totaled $124 million before property debt. Our acquisition cost was $38 million.
As to redevelopment activities, we expect to have 10 active redevelopment projects in 2012. We continue construction activity at our $94 million redevelopments of Pacific Bay Vistas at San Bruno, California. As Keith mentioned, we will start leasing activities next week, and expect our first move-in during the third quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter of 2012, we began redevelopment of The Palazzo at Park La Brea, located in West Los Angeles. The Palazzo is a high-end property in a great location. Our customers are looking for an even more unique experience. And to address this, we've commenced a $15 million program to further upgrade our 115 penthouse units to an even higher finish. Penthouse residence will also have exclusive access to a new rooftop patio and lounge area. Delivery of amenities in the first penthouse units is expected in the third quarter of this year.
We anticipate completing 2 smaller projects in South Florida during 2012. The remaining 6 projects include 1 each in Seattle, San Francisco and Chicago; 2 in Center City Philadelphia, and we expect to begin phase 2 of our redevelopment of Lincoln place in Venice, California. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and residents have started to move into these completed units. 
We expect to invest a total $400 million in these 10 projects over the next 2 to 3 years, with current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rates of return in excess of 10%.
We plan to invest $125 million to $150 million during 2012, and a deep pipeline of opportunities exist within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year.
Regarding the balance sheet, during the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expect to meet by 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA at less than 7x, and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. As a reminder, we expect our debt plus preferred equity to EBITDA coverage to be at 8.7x by year end. 
Using third-party NOI projections for the years 2013 through 2015, we expect coverages to improve by almost a full turn to approximately 7.8x by the end of 2015. Production of debt through scheduled amortizations and earn-in from our redevelopment activities would improve coverages further to about 7x by the end of 2015.
So our base case of continued revenue growth, property debt amortization and earn-in from redevelopment activities gets us to our target by the end of 2015. That said, we are looking for opportunities to accelerate reaching our target.
Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.76 to $1.84 per share and AFFO of $1.21 to $1.31 per share. We are increasing full year guidance for Conventional Same Store net operating income by 25 basis points to a range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The increase in Conventional Same Store net operating income guidance is driven by a decrease in our expected expense growth rate of 2.25% to 2.75%, a 25-basis point decrease at the midpoint. We are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year of 4.5% to 5.5% increase.
Affordable Same Store NOI guidance is increased by 50 basis points to a range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range of 5% to 6.75%, a 50-basis point increase. Higher NOI expectations are driven primarily by better-than-expected first quarter results.
For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.40 to $0.44 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store NOI is projected to be flat to up 1% compared to first quarter. We do expect that revenues will be up sequentially about 1.5%.
Before we take questions, I would like to point out that we have added 2 new schedules to our financial supplement. First, we have added Schedule 6b [ph] which details Conventional Same Store property operating expense trends, and second, Schedule 10 has been added to provide expanded disclosure related to our redevelopment activities. 
Also, to provide more disclosure and allow for meaningful comparisons with many of our peers, we provided both rental rate per unit and total revenue per unit in our earnings release. The operating results by market information we provide in our supplemental schedules include revenue per unit information. Approximately 10% of our rental revenues come from sources such as utility reimbursements, parking and storage.
Keith reported in his remarks the average income of our customers who moved in during the first quarter. In addition, he provided our calculated rent-to-income ratio of 21.8%. I wanted to provide some background on how we calculated the 21.8% amount. When reviewing our collected data, we noted that we had some significant outliers with regards to very high household income at properties like The Palazzo, Flamingo and Calhoun Beach Club. We did not want those outliers to skew our calculated rent to income metric when aggregating our entire portfolio. We've calculated our rent-to-income metric by taking each apartment home's ratio, adding them together and then dividing by the number of homes. So the low rent-to-income percentage at some of our high-end properties does not then overwhelm the overall results when blended this with the rest of the portfolio. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I’ll turn it over to you for the first question, please."

It's the specific submarkets they happen to be in and some various demographic measures within those submarkets. As it relates to the portfolio as a whole, we haven't, in some of the prior conferences, provided some detail on where portfolio rents will move. The anticipation is, is that -- they’ll move in accordance with the magnitude of what we actually execute, how's that? They're going up. And I think in terms of what to expect and when we will decide to pull the trigger, it will really be driven by pricing. We've got some very good execution this quarter in the properties that we sold and we will continue to look for good executions as we look forward."

And at the end of the day, roughly half of that is coming -- the increase from the prior year is coming from rental increases and roughly half is coming from the fact that we sold lower rate of sales. If we're successful in accelerating some sales, you'll see a similar acceleration with regards to the piece having to do with the sales and properties.

And so really we look at new leases being the barometer of kind of how they're performing. And so at the moment, what we're seeing is about 140-basis point spread between the As and the Cs. Of note, what's a little bit interesting is we're starting to see some acceleration with the Cs, which previously had been really driven by the As.

The affordable game plan really hasn't changed in that we expect to sell 60 Affordable assets this year, and if we do have the opportunity to maybe accelerate another 20 to 25 asset sales into this year. But then the proceeds that would be generated from that are pretty small, our ownership percentages are smaller on that and wouldn't have as much of a meaningful impact on use of proceeds to take out preferred equity. And then as Terry talked about in his prepared remarks, overall, longer-term, our expectation was to continue to see that more Affordable sales over the next few years. On the Conventional side, in terms of what the numbers are going to be, again, we're focused on the right economics, in getting what we want to get. And we're looking to do it. We're not committing that it's going happen. We're hopeful that it will happen. Just at this point, you raised the right point, Mike, that we would expect to sell about 5% to 10% of our assets or sorry our lowest-yield assets over the next couple of years. That's the population we're drawing from to see if it makes sense to accelerate some of those into 2012."

So for there, we'll have absolutely no NOI dilution and it will have only accretive impacts. Now of course, we'll capitalize and we'll divest interest as those things come online, but net-net that's going to be a positive contribution for us. And there is no redev drag from those projects. And the other projects that we have listed on Schedule 10, Flamingo South Beach is actually some exterior work. There's not any units being taken down, so we'll have no redev drag from Flamingo South Beach. Plantation Gardens has been undergoing a renovation for some time since 2011, and we're getting to the point where it's actually turning where we had a minimal amount of redev drag on that. And I said minimal because it's a smaller project. And the good news is that will start contributing NOI positive for us. And then finally, Palazzo will have some drag. It's a smaller project. There is a decent amount of those dollars that are being spent on amenities and exterior works that won't take units out of -- in a sense, out of place. On a project like Palazzo, there will be a little bit of redev drag. Now for the projects we have going on in the future, there will be some disruption in terms of redev being done on the terms, and terms taking a little longer because of that, and as those projects come out and we get more specific information on those, we can provide definitely some color as to the redev drag. What I think, Taylor is when we used to talk about redev drag in the program where we're spending $350 million a year, it was a pretty significant negative contribution to our earnings. But with the projects we have in place here, we're not going to be looking at those kind of numbers like we did back in 2006, 2007 and 2008."

During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. During the second quarter, we earned FFO of $0.46 per share. That's up 10% year-over-year. And we earned AFFO of $0.34 per share, that's up 17% year-over-year. 
Operating team led by Keith maintained high occupancy while increasing rents, with new and renewal rents averaging 5% higher than rents on expiring leases.
The 12-month leases, the hard work of Keith and his team walks in today the revenue base supporting the growth we expect over the next year. Keith's team also excelled in cost discipline, particularly in the area of labor utilization, as you can see in the 8% year-over-year decline in payroll cost. Importantly, we maintained a healthy level of capital investment and maintenance spending. Our properties are in good condition, as you can see from the rising rents they command. Our portfolio gets better and better. Its average revenue per unit was about $1,300 in the second quarter. This important measure of portfolio quality determined and paid by customers was up about 8% year-over-year, about 1/2 due to rent growth and 1/2 due to acquisition in redevelopment of higher rent properties funded by the sale of lower rated properties. Cash from the sale of lower rated properties was used to fund redevelopment activity and 3  property acquisitions. Average monthly revenue per unit for property the sold year-to-date, was about $740. Average monthly revenue per unit for our 3 acquisitions year-to-date is about $1,400, almost twice. Average on trended monthly revenue per unit for year to date redevelopment starts is expected to be about $2,100, or nearly 3x the rate of the properties sold. As I said, our portfolio gets better and better. 
Our redevelopment business headed by Dan Matula is ramping up, and the 5 projects we have underway are on track. We expect these projects together with 5 others to be started later this year to add about $2 per share in net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.
The balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. Year-to-date through July, we reduced total leverage by more than $0.5 billion, about $600 million from redemption of preferred stocks with increases in property from acquisitions, including limited partner transactions, almost offset by monthly amortization and asset sales. As a result and with steady earnings growth, we reduced leverages of multiple of current quarter EBITDA from 9.5 at the start of the year to just over 8 today. We're on track to meet our target of 7 to 1 within the next 18 months or so.
Our business strategy is simple, own and operate apartments in across section of large U.S. markets, upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower rated properties. Through this end, we've announced plans to exit the Asset Management business by sale of NAPICO later this year and to largely exit the Affordable business by sale of individual properties over the next 5 years or so. We're on track to execute both decisions. For simplification, we expect higher quality earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparencies. 
In January, the Aimco Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.18. Meeting this week, the board raised the dividend again, this time to $0.20 per share, still below a 60% payout ratio. Some business is good. We have a capable management team and outstanding teammates both on-site and off-site. We are working hard and working well together to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions, making solid progress in our plans to create shareholder value over the longer-term.
Now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

New, renewal and blended lease rates all improved sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter, which sets us up well for the second half of 2012 creates a book of business that will earn in this fall and into 2013. 
During July, these rates continued their positive momentum. Blended lease rates were up 5.3%, with new lease rates up 4.5% and renewal rates up 6.3%. July's average daily occupancy was 94.9% on par with June's results. August and September renewal offers went out with 7% to 9% increases, and October renewals are going out with 6% to 8% increases, minimal seasonal adjustment. 
Turnover was 45.7% for the quarter compared to 45.1% for the first quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention, and we not only achieved higher rent increases on renewal rents but also because it allows us to keep our cost down.
We have not seen any material changes in reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: Career moves at 24%, pricing at 21% and purchasing homes at 14%. While we have also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We are successfully replacing our move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We have 6,900 move-ins during the second quarter with an average income of 87,000, median income $60,000 and rent income ratio of 21.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 240 basis points year-over-year due to increases in taxes and insurance. Property level operating expenses are actually down 1.1% year-over-year. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 5.9%.
Let me provide some market-specific color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from 5% to nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Steady performance for the quarter, midrange growth of 4% to 5% were Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding up the top 10 markets were Orange County at 3.4% and San Diego at 3.3%. Orange County is reaccelerating new lease and renewal pricing increases at 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, over the trailing 4 weeks while simultaneously improving occupancy month-over-month. 
As an update to our expansion in the Bay Area, pre-leasing at our Pacific Bay Vista community is now successfully well underway, as our first occupancy is scheduled for later this quarter. We are building upon our second quarter successes with a solid July, setting up well for a solid third quarter and beyond. With great thanks to our team in the field for a strong first half to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally I will provide a guidance update.

Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share is $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.02 from outperformance from property operations consisting of both higher revenues in our Affordable portfolio and lower expenses in our Conventional portfolio, the $0.03 due to a number of items, including $0.02 related to an unexpected recovery from a previous casualty loss and lower-than-anticipated insurance losses. 
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties with about 2,200 units, including low-rated  Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.1%. These properties had an average revenue per unit of $825 compared to our portfolio today of $1,290. We also sold 11 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 10.1%. 
Sales in the second quarter were a mix of higher and lower quality Affordable assets with the higher quality assets generating cap rates in the range of 6.75% to 8%. 
In June, we acquired a property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for $39 million. The acquisition was funded in part by newly placed nonrecourse property debt, in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower-rated properties. The acquired property consists of 42 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $4,000 and it's average rents are approximately 38% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through significant capital upgrades in select units and operational improvements. Property net used to help finance the acquisition is a 10-year note with a local bank with a fixed rate of 3.95%. 
In July, we acquired for $19.7 million a property located in downtown San Diego adjacent to the District. Acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower-rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $1,880 and its average rents are approximately 15% higher than the local market average. We tend to add value to the acquisition through operational improvements. The property that assumed has a remaining term of 4.7 years and interest rate of 5.51%. 
For the year, properties acquired at an average revenue per unit of about $1,400 compared to $740 for our property sold, looking to further our goal of increasing overall revenues per unit for our portfolio. 
As to redevelopment activities, we described in our last earnings call the 10 projects we expect to have under redevelopment in 2012, which includes properties located in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, Chicago, Center City Philadelphia and South Florida. During the second quarter, our team in Chicago began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel on our Elm Creek property. Market rents for comparable products average approximately $2,950 per unit today and first occupancy is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
We also continued construction activity at our redevelopment Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California and our first residents will move in later this quarter. Phase I of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and 50 returning residents have moved into those completed units. 
Looking ahead, we are nearing completion of the common area amenity upgrades at The Palazzo in West Los Angeles, we expect to deliver these improvements in early September. Additionally, we expect to begin delivering upgraded luxury penthouse units for lease ups in the fourth quarter.
We are set to begin Phase II construction at Lincoln Place as soon as the financing is in place, which we expect to be in the third quarter. During the second half of this year, we expect to start construction at 2900 on First in Seattle, to in Marin in Marin County California and The Sterling and Park Towne Place, both located in Center City, Philadelphia. And we plan to invest a total of $400 million in these 10 projects, $125 million to $150 million this year, and the balance over the next 2 to 3 years. We expect these projects to generate current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rate of return in excess of 10%. This pipeline of additional opportunities within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year exists.
Regarding the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expected to meet by the end of 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt and preferred equity to EBITDA less than 7x and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. 
Since our last earnings call, Aimco has made significant progress towards these targets with the redemption of more than $300 million of preferred stock during the second quarter and redemption of additional $300 million in July. Our current and projected coverages for this year on a pro forma basis are as follows: Preferred equity to EBITDA of 8.2x currently to 7.7x by year end; coverage of interest and preferred dividends of 2.2x currently and 2.3x by year end. Most importantly, we now expect to achieve our leverage target of debt and preferred equity to EBITDA by early 2014, almost 2 years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Leverage reductions is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings. Preferred stock redemptions were funded by 2 common stock offerings and option exercises during the second quarter and the exercise of the green shoe in early July, which generated net proceeds to Aimco of approximately $642 million. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares at an average price of $26.53.
Through these transactions, we expect annual FFO and AFFO to increase by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. Our guidance revisions announced last night take into account the impact for 2012, which is a decrease of $0.01 for FFO and an increase of $0.05 for AFFO. As Terry mentioned, in keeping with its focus on growing dividends with AFFO, Aimco's board increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20 effective with our next dividend this month.
In addition to the increase in FFO and AFFO from our equity offerings, we expect a further increase earnings in each of the next few years due to activity with our property debt. Each year we amortize approximately $80 million of property debt using retained earnings. This equates to about $0.03 of increased earnings each year. In addition, we have between $200 million and $300 million of debt coming due in each of the next 3 years. Refinancing these maturities at today's interest rates equates to an average of $0.03 of additional interest savings in each of the next several years. 
Finally, going back to our portfolio, we have discussed our interest in potentially accelerating sales anticipated for the next couple of years into 2012. Identified Use of Proceeds the redemption of high-cost preferred equity no longer exists. That said, if the compelling opportunity presents itself for the sale of some or all the contemplated assets, we will certainly give it consideration and compare the merits to the potential usage of such proceeds.
Finally, as to guidance, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.78 to $1.86 per share and AFFO of $1.30 to $1.38 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store net operating income growth of 6% to 7%, which is unchanged at the midpoint. We've narrowed our revenue guidance to an increase in revenues of 4.75% to 5.25%, unchanged at the midpoint, and we have updated our expense guidance with expenses expected to increase 2% to 2.5%, an improvement of 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Affordable Same Store net operating income guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, a 200-basis point improvement at the midpoint. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in the range from 5.5% to 6.5%. 
We've also increased our dispositions guidance by $50 million at the midpoint.
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store net operating income growth projected to be 6.5% to 7.5%. With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Also we've had an outperformance in operations in the second quarter and for the year we kept our guidance the same. So that's about a $0.01 there, so that was around timing of expenses or some things like that, and then the other $0.01 is just kind of rounding with some things and so that's why we kept guidance where we did raising it the $0.02 versus the $0.05."

A couple of things there. You're absolutely right that we have an acceleration expected with property sales in the second half and I wouldn't say it so much from the Affordable side as it is from dimensional, it's actually more weighted to the Conventional, those are bigger assets that will generate larger increases. In terms of number properties, it will be more Affordable. But the vast majority of the dollars will be coming from the Conventional side. You raised a good point, Eric. Ultimately, we look at what these properties generate from a projected internal rate of return perspective or free cash flow rate of return and even though the cap rates on the Affordable side, the NOI cap rates tend to be higher, when you factor in all the cash flows from those properties, including capital replacement costs, they come in with free cash flow into the rates of return that are projected well south of 7, usually in the 6 range or maybe a little bit lower. So what that does mean is potentially some FFO dilution. What it certainly means though is much less and if not maybe slightly accretive to AFFO because we lose that CR. And then importantly, we look at that trade and what we are getting for that and John kind of described how that works some of the acquisitions we've done and importantly the work that on the redevelopment side. And so we could cause some short-term dilution and funds from operations not so much adjusted funds from operations but a stronger portfolio and stronger return projections going forward."

With regards for the opportunity to do further deleveraging, where we stand and stay, we like to go path that we're on that's through property debt amortization, which is about $80 million, $85 million a year through retained earnings as well as projected continued NOI growth. In our case NOI growth accelerating as we get to the second half of the year as you can see from our guidance. It puts us on a path to be about where we want to be in about 18 to 20 months.

Last year, in the second half of the year, our occupancy was around 95.2. So on a year-over-year basis, Mike, we have a nice pickup in occupancy as we projected today of approximately maybe 40 to 50 basis points. So we are going to get some acceleration from maintaining occupancy levels as I just described. So that's going to help somewhat. And then Keith has given out the information on what's happening with the new rates and new lease rates. In July we actually saw our best performance on a blended basis of 5.3. And we feel pretty good that we're at least going into season, we're going to be there. And so that's puts us in a good position to have a similar rate growth that you saw in our second quarter.

Aimco looks at all of its capital decision-making using a consistent metric that we call free cash flow internal rate of return. And so that's a mouthful, but what we mean by that is adjust everything for net operating income to free cash flow. And for consistency and comparability, we subtract $1,200 a unit of capital replacement without spending. So and Ernie has talked earlier about adjusting Affordable NOI cap rates to free cash flow. It means that free cash flow is a significantly lower number, particularly at lower price points. We look at it as an internal rate of return, adjusting it for expected growth, generally relying on average of data providers for the particular submarket. And then very importantly, we adjust the exit cap rate to reflect the fact that today's cap rates are influenced by the very high rent growth that we are all now enjoying. But over a longer period of time, it is more conservative to not to predict that but to predict something like the 20-year average. And we use that measure. And what would motivate us to sell either one asset or large portfolio of assets would be our opportunity to redeploy the capital at a higher risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And so, I wouldn't want you to take away from Ernie's comments the sense that there's a large transaction pending, that's not the case. But we are in the market actively. John underwrites a 1 or 2 or 3 transactions a week. We look at opportunities large and small. And if we found the right circumstance, where we could sell lower-rated assets at a free cash flow internal rate of return, which I think has probably average sub 7 since the start of the year and redeploy it at a free flow internal rate of return in higher quality assets, north of 8 going forward, something like that spread might be attractive to us."

During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. During the second quarter, we earned FFO of $0.46 per share. That's up 10% year-over-year. And we earned AFFO of $0.34 per share, that's up 17% year-over-year. 
The operating team led by Keith maintained high occupancy while increasing rents, with new and renewal rents averaging 5% higher than rents on expiring leases.
The 12-month leases, the hard work of Keith and his team walks in today a revenue base supporting the growth we expect over the next year. Keith's team also excelled in cost discipline, particularly in the area of labor utilization, as you can see in the 8% year-over-year decline in payroll costs. Importantly, we maintained a healthy level of capital investment and maintenance spending. Our properties are in good condition, as you can see from the rising rents they command. Our portfolio gets better and better. Its average revenue per unit was about $1,300 in the second quarter. This important measure of portfolio quality determined and paid by customers was up about 8% year-over-year, about 1/2 due to rent growth and 1/2 due to acquisition and redevelopment of higher rent properties funded by the sale of lower rated properties. Cash from the sale of lower rated properties was used to fund redevelopment activity and 3 property acquisitions. Average monthly revenue per unit for the properties sold year-to-date was about $740. Average monthly revenue per unit for our 3 acquisitions year-to-date is about $1,400, almost twice. And average un-trended monthly revenue per unit for year-to-date redevelopment starts is expected to be about $2,100, or nearly 3x the rate of the properties sold. As I said, our portfolio gets better and better. 
Our redevelopment business headed by Dan Matula is ramping up, and the 5 projects we have under way are on track. We expect these projects, together with 5 others to be started later this year, to add about $2 per share in net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.
Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. Year-to-date through July, we reduced total leverage by more than $0.5 billion, about $600 million from redemption of preferred stocks with increases in property debt from acquisitions, including limited partner transactions almost offset by monthly amortization and asset sales. As a result, and with steady earnings growth, we reduced leverages of multiple of current quarter EBITDA from 9.5 at the start of the year to just over 8 today. We're on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 18 months or so.
Our business strategy is simple: own and operate apartments in a cross section of large U.S. markets and upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower rated properties. Through this end, we've announced plans to exit the Asset Management business by sale of NAPICO later this year and to largely exit the Affordable business by sale of individual properties over the next 5 years or so. We're on track to execute both decisions. Through simplification, we expect higher quality earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparencies. 
In January, the Aimco Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.18. Meeting this week, the board raised the dividend again, this time to $0.20 per share, still below a 60% payout ratio. In some, business is good. We have a capable management team and outstanding teammates, both on-site and off-site. We're working hard and working well together to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions. We're making solid progress in our plans to create shareholder value over the longer term.

As we closed out the first half of 2012, we successfully improved upon our first quarter start with our second quarter results.

As we closed out the first half of 2012, we successfully improved upon our first quarter start with our second quarter results. Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.6% year-over-year, up 4.4% year-to-date and up 1% compared to the first quarter. We're pleased with our overall performance and particularly with our ability to grow year-over-year revenues from one quarter to the next. 
Keeping with revenue for a moment. Second quarter blended rates were up 5%, with new leases up 4.3% and renewals up 5.7% on a lease-to-lease basis. New, renewal and blended lease rates all improved sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of 2012 and creates a book of business that will earn in this fall and into 2013. 
During July, these rates continued their positive momentum. Blended lease rates were up 5.3%, with new lease rates up 4.5% and renewal rates up 6.3%. July's average daily occupancy was 94.9% on par with June's result. August and September renewal offers went out with 7% to 9% increases, and October renewals are going out with 6% to 8% increases, a minimal seasonal adjustment. 
Turnover was 45.7% for the quarter compared to 45.1% for first quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down.
We have not seen any material changes in reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: career moves at 24%, pricing at 21% and purchasing homes at 14%. While we have also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We are successfully replacing our move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We have 6,900 move-ins during the second quarter with an average income of 87,000, and median income $60,000 and a rent-to-income ratio of 21.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 240 basis points year-over-year due to increases in taxes and insurance. Property level operating expenses are actually down 1.1% year-over-year. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 5.9%.
Let me provide some market-specific color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from 5% to nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Our steady performers for the quarter with midrange growth of 4% to 5% were Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding up the top 10 markets were Orange County at 3.4% and San Diego at 3.3%. Orange County is reaccelerating, with new lease and renewal price increases at 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, over the trailing 4 weeks while simultaneously improving occupancy month-over-month. 
As an update to our expansion in the Bay Area, pre-leasing at our Pacific Bay Vista community is now successfully well under way, with our first occupancy scheduled for later this quarter. We are building upon our second quarter successes with a solid July and setting up well for a solid third quarter and beyond. With great thanks to our team in the field for a strong first half to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally I will provide a guidance update. Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share wa",1468,"Thanks, Keith. Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.02 from outperformance from property operations, consisting of both higher revenues in our Affordable portfolio and lower expenses in our Conventional portfolio, and $0.03 due to a number of items, including $0.02 related to an unexpected recovery from a previous casualty loss and lower-than-anticipated insurance losses. 
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties with about 2,200 units, including 5 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.1%. These properties had an average revenue per unit of $825 compared to our portfolio today of $1,290. We also sold 11 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 10.1%. Sales in the second quarter were a mix of higher and lower quality Affordable assets, with the higher quality assets generating cap rates in the range of 6.75% to 8%. 
In June, we acquired a property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for $39 million. The acquisition was funded in part by newly placed nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 42 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $4,000, and its average rents are approximately 38% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through significant capital upgrades in select units and operational improvements. The property debt used to help finance the acquisition is a 10-year note with a local bank at a fixed rate of 3.95%. 
In July, we acquired for $19.7 million a property located in downtown San Diego adjacent to the Gaslamp district. The acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $1,880, and its average rents are approximately 15% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through operational improvements. The property debt assumed has a remaining term of 4.7 years and an interest rate of 5.51%. 
For the year, properties acquired had an average revenue per unit of about $1,400 compared to $740 for our properties sold, helping to further our goal of increasing overall revenues per unit for our portfolio. 
As to redevelopment activities, we described on our last earnings call the 10 projects we expect to have under redevelopment in 2012, which includes properties located in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, Chicago, Center City Philadelphia and South Florida. During the second quarter, our team in Chicago began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel at our Elm Creek property. Current market rents for comparable product average approximately $2,950 per unit today, and first occupancy is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
We also continued construction activity at our redevelopment in Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California, and our first residents will move in later this quarter. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and 50 returning residents have moved into those completed units. 
Looking ahead, we are nearing completion of the common area amenity upgrades at The Palazzo in West Los Angeles and expect to deliver these improvements in early September. Additionally, we expect to begin delivering upgraded luxury penthouse units for lease ups in the fourth quarter.
We are set to begin Phase 2 construction at Lincoln Place as soon as the financing is in place, which we expect to be in the third quarter. During the second half of this year, we expect to start construction at 2900 on First in Seattle, The Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California, and The Sterling and Park Towne Place, both located in Center City, Philadelphia. And we plan to invest a total of $400 million in these 10 projects, with $125 million to $150 million this year, and the balance over the next 2 to 3 years. We expect these projects to generate current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rate of return in excess of 10%. A deep pipeline of additional opportunities within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year exists.
Regarding the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expected to meet by the end of 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of less than 7x and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. 
Since our last earnings call, Aimco has made significant progress towards these targets with the redemption of more than $300 million of preferred stock during the second quarter and redemption of an additional $300 million in July. Our current and projected coverages for this year on a pro forma basis are as follows: debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 8.2x currently and 7.7x by year-end; EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of 2.2x currently and 2.3x by year-end. 
Most importantly, we now expect to achieve our leverage target of debt and preferred equity to EBITDA by early 2014, almost 2 years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings. The preferred stock redemptions were funded by 2 common stock offerings and option exercises during the second quarter and the exercise of a greenshoe in early July, which generated net proceeds to Aimco of approximately $642 million. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares at an average price of $26.53.
Through these transactions, we expect annual FFO and AFFO to increase by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. Our guidance revisions announced last night take into account the impact for 2012, which is a decrease of $0.01 for FFO and an increase of $0.05 for AFFO. As Terry mentioned, in keeping with its focus on growing dividends with AFFO, Aimco's board increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20, effective with our next dividend this month.
In addition to the increase in FFO and AFFO from our equity offerings, we expect to further increase earnings in each of the next few years due to activity with our property debt. Each year, we amortize approximately $80 million of property debt using retained earnings. This equates to about $0.03 of increased earnings each year. In addition, we have between $200 million and $300 million of debt coming due in each of the next 3 years. Refinancing these maturities at today's interest rates equates to an average of $0.03 of additional interest savings in each of the next several years. 
Finally, going back to our portfolio, we have discussed our interest in potentially accelerating sales anticipated for the next couple of years into 2012. One of our identified use of proceeds, the redemption of high-cost preferred equity, no longer exists. That said, if a compelling opportunity presents itself for the sale of some or all of the contemplated assets, we'll certainly give it consideration and compare its merits to the potential use of such proceeds.
Finally, as to guidance, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.78 to $1.86 per share and AFFO of $1.30 to $1.38 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store net operating income growth of 6% to 7%, which is unchanged at the midpoint. We have narrowed our revenue guidance to an increase in revenues of 4.75% to 5.25%, unchanged at the midpoint, and we have updated our expense guidance with expenses expected to increase 2% to 2.5%, an improvement of 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Affordable Same Store net operating income guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% is a 200 basis point improvement at the midpoint. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in the range from 5.5% to 6.5%. 
We've also increased our dispositions guidance by $50 million at the midpoint.
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store net operating income growth projected to be 6.5% to 7.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Also we've had an outperformance in operations in the second quarter and for the year we kept our guidance the same. So that's about a $0.01 there, so that was around timing of expenses and some things like that. And then the other $0.01 is just kind of rounding with some things, and so that's why we kept guidance where we did, raising it the $0.02 versus the $0.05."

Certainly at that price point, we've got a customer that's different than what we would have in a C asset. And we feel like we've got an opportunity to raise rents there through product quality and customer type that we draw into those properties. It's different than if we went in and bought the assets. Nominally, we could take that at a face rate, say, well, if we had $600 rent, there's more room to raise rents to get that to average. But those $600 rents at a property are reflective of property condition, age, economic obsolescence on the property and other things. And so, again, we feel like on the properties that we're buying, we've got opportunity to have outsized growth. Some of that is related to the submarket, where they're located, and we feel like we've got submarkets with greater growth potential than those in the submarkets where we're selling.

Let me address a couple of things there. You're absolutely right that we have an acceleration expected with property sales in the second half, but I wouldn't say that it's so much from the Affordable side as it is from the dimensional. And it's actually probably more weighted toward the Conventional, those are bigger assets that will generate larger increases. In terms of the number of properties, it will be more Affordable, but the vast majority of the dollars will be coming from the Conventional side. But you raised a good point, Eric. Ultimately, we look at what do these properties generate from a projected internal rate of return perspective or free cash flow internal rate of return. And even though the cap rates on the Affordable side, the NOI cap rates, tend to be higher, when you factor in all the cash flows from those properties, including capital replacement costs, they come in with free cash flow internal rates of return that are projected well south of 7, usually in the 6 range or maybe a little bit lower. And so what that does mean is potentially some FFO dilution. What it certainly means though is much less and if not maybe slightly accretive to AFFO because we lose that CR. And then importantly, we look at that trade and what we are getting for that. And John kind of described how that works with some of the acquisitions we've done and importantly the work that Dan Metula is doing on the redevelopment side. And so it could cause some short-term dilution and funds from operations, not so much, if at all, in adjusted funds from operations, but a stronger portfolio and stronger return projections going forward."

We just thought that would be potentially the more efficient way to do it. And importantly, after seeing people at the June NAREIT meeting, just take -- let's take leverage off the table. And we're able to do that by doing the second deal. With regards for the opportunity to do further deleveraging, where we stand and stay, we like to collide paths that we're on, through property debt amortization, which is about $80 million, $85 million a year through retained earnings as well as projected -- continued NOI growth, in our case NOI growth accelerating as we get into the second half of the year, as you can see from our guidance. It puts us on a path to be about where we want to be in about 18 to 20 months. So we feel pretty good about that.

Our guidance for the year is we expect that occupancy to come in between 95.5% and 96%. Importantly, as I have implied, for the second half, we're going to kind of be right in between there, so that's exactly what we did in the first half of 2012. Last year, in the second half of the year, our occupancy was around 95.2%. So on a year-over-year basis, Mike, we're going to have a nice pickup in occupancy as we projected today of approximately maybe 40 to 50 basis points. So we're going to get some acceleration from maintaining occupancy levels as I've just described. That's going to help somewhat. And then, Keith has given out the information on what's happening with the new rates and new lease rates. In July, we actually saw our best performance on a blended basis of 5.3. And we feel pretty good that we're at least going in to add a season, we're going to be there. And so that's puts us in a good position to have similar rate growth that you saw in our second quarter. So all that math adds up plus what we're doing in other income to have a second half that's going to be stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis in terms of revenue growth."

Aimco looks at all of its capital decision making using a consistent metric that we call free cash flow internal rate of return. And so that's a mouthful, but what we mean by that is to adjust everything from net operating income to free cash flow. And for consistency and comparability, we subtract $1,200 a unit of capital replacement of spending. So in Ernie's talk earlier about adjusting Affordable NOI cap rates to free cash flow, it means that free cash flow is a significantly lower number, particularly at lower price points. Then we look at it as an internal rate of return, adjusting it for expected growth, generally relying on an average of data providers for the particular submarket. And then very importantly, we adjust the exit cap rate to reflect the fact that today's cap rates are influenced by the very high rent growth that we're all now enjoying. But over a longer period of time, it's more conservative to -- not to predict that, but to predict something like the 20-year average. So we use that measure. And what would motivate us to sell either one asset or large portfolio of assets would be our opportunity to redeploy the capital at a higher risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And so, I wouldn't want you to take away from Ernie's comments the sense that there's a large transaction pending, that's not the case. But we are in the market actively. John underwrites 1 or 2 or 3 transactions a week. We look at opportunities large and small. And if we found the right circumstance, where we could sell lower rated assets at a free cash flow internal rate of return, which I think is probably averaged sub 7 since the start of the year and redeploy it at a free flow internal rate of return in higher quality assets, north of 8 going forward, something like that spread might be attractive to us."

During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. During the second quarter, we earned FFO of $0.46 per share. That's up 10% year-over-year. And we earned AFFO of $0.34 per share, that's up 17% year-over-year. 
The operating team led by Keith maintained high occupancy while increasing rents, with new and renewal rents averaging 5% higher than rents on expiring leases.
The 12-month leases, the hard work of Keith and his team, locks in today a revenue base supporting the growth we expect over the next year. Keith's team also excelled in cost discipline, particularly in the area of labor utilization, as you can see in the 8% year-over-year decline in payroll costs. Importantly, we maintained a healthy level of capital investment and maintenance spending. Our properties are in good condition, as you can see from the rising rents they command. Our portfolio gets better and better. Its average revenue per unit was about $1,300 in the second quarter. This important measure of portfolio quality determined and paid by customers was up about 8% year-over-year, about 1/2 due to rent growth and 1/2 due to acquisition and redevelopment of higher rent properties funded by the sale of lower rated properties. Cash from the sale of lower rated properties was used to fund redevelopment activity and 3 property acquisitions. Average monthly revenue per unit for the properties sold year-to-date was about $740. Average monthly revenue per unit for our 3 acquisitions year-to-date is about $1,400, almost twice. And average un-trended monthly revenue per unit for year-to-date redevelopment starts is expected to be about $2,100, or nearly 3x the rate of the properties sold. As I said, our portfolio gets better and better. 
Our redevelopment business headed by Dan Matula is ramping up, and the 5 projects we have under way are on track. We expect these projects, together with 5 others to be started later this year, to add about $2 per share in net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.
Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. Year-to-date through July, we reduced total leverage by more than $0.5 billion, about $600 million from redemption of preferred stocks, with increases in property debt from acquisitions, including limited partner transactions, almost offset by monthly amortization and asset sales. As a result, and with steady earnings growth, we reduced leverages of multiple of current quarter EBITDA from 9.5 at the start of the year to just over 8 today. We're on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 18 months or so.
Our business strategy is simple: own and operate apartments in a cross section of large U.S. markets and upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower rated properties. Through this end, we've announced plans to exit the Asset Management business by sale of NAPICO later this year and to largely exit the Affordable business by sale of individual properties over the next 5 years or so. We're on track to execute both decisions. Through simplification, we expect higher quality earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparency. 
In January, the Aimco Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.18. Meeting this week, the board raised the dividend again, this time to $0.20 per share, still below a 60% payout ratio. In sum, business is good. We have a capable management team and outstanding teammates, both on-site and off-site. We're working hard and working well together to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions. We're making solid progress in our plans to create shareholder value over the longer term.

Keeping with revenue for a moment. Second quarter blended rates were up 5%, with new leases up 4.3% and renewals up 5.7% on a lease-to-lease basis. New, renewal and blended lease rates all improved sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of 2012 and creates a book of business that will earn in this fall and into 2013. 
During July, these rates continued their positive momentum. Blended lease rates were up 5.3%, with new lease rates up 4.5% and renewal rates up 6.3%. July's average daily occupancy was 94.9% on par with June's result. August and September renewal offers went out with 7% to 9% increases, and October renewals are going out with 6% to 8% increases, a minimal seasonal adjustment. 
Turnover was 45.7% for the quarter compared to 45.1% for first quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down.
We have not seen any material changes in reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: career moves at 24%, pricing at 21% and purchasing homes at 14%. While we have also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We are successfully replacing our move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 6,900 move-ins during the second quarter with an average income of $87,000, and median income of $60,000 and a rent-to-income ratio of 21.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 240 basis points year-over-year due to increases in taxes and insurance. Property level operating expenses are actually down 1.1% year-over-year. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 5.9%.
Let me provide some market-specific color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from 5% to nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Our steady performers for the quarter with midrange growth of 4% to 5% were Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding out the top 10 markets were Orange County at 3.4% and San Diego at 3.3%. Orange County is reaccelerating, with new lease and renewal price increases at 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, over the trailing 4 weeks while simultaneously improving occupancy month-over-month. 
As an update to our expansion in the Bay Area, pre-leasing at our Pacific Bay Vista community is now successfully well underway, with our first occupancy scheduled for later this quarter. We are building upon our second quarter successes with a solid July and setting up well for a solid third quarter and beyond. With great thanks to our team in the field for a strong first half to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share w",1478,"Thanks, Keith. Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.02 from outperformance from property operations, consisting of both higher revenues in our Affordable portfolio and lower expenses in our Conventional portfolio, and $0.03 due to a number of items, including $0.02 related to an unexpected recovery from a previous casualty loss and lower-than-anticipated insurance losses. 
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties with about 2,200 units, including 5 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.1%. These properties had an average revenue per unit of $825 compared to our portfolio today of $1,290. We also sold 11 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 10.1%. Sales in the second quarter were a mix of higher and lower quality Affordable assets, with the higher quality assets generating cap rates in the range of 6.75% to 8%. 
In June, we acquired a property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for $39 million. The acquisition was funded in part by newly placed nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 42 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $4,000, and its average rents are approximately 38% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through significant capital upgrades in select units and operational improvements. The property debt used to help finance the acquisition is a 10-year note with a local bank at a fixed rate of 3.95%. 
In July, we acquired for $19.7 million a property located in downtown San Diego adjacent to the Gaslamp district. The acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $1,880, and its average rents are approximately 15% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through operational improvements. The property debt assumed has a remaining term of 4.7 years and an interest rate of 5.51%. 
For the year, properties acquired had an average revenue per unit of about $1,400 compared to $740 for our properties sold, helping to further our goal of increasing overall revenues per unit for our portfolio. 
As to redevelopment activities, we described on our last earnings call the 10 projects we expect to have under redevelopment in 2012, which include properties located in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, Chicago, Center City Philadelphia and South Florida. During the second quarter, our team in Chicago began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel at our Elm Creek property. Current market rents for comparable products average approximately $2,950 per unit today, and first occupancy is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
We also continued construction activity at our redevelopment in Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California, and our first residents will move in later this quarter. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and 50 returning residents have moved into those completed units. 
Looking ahead, we are nearing completion of the common area amenity upgrades at The Palazzo in West Los Angeles and expect to deliver these improvements in early September. Additionally, we expect to begin delivering upgraded luxury penthouse units for lease ups in the fourth quarter.
We are set to begin Phase 2 construction at Lincoln Place as soon as the financing is in place, which we expect to be in the third quarter. During the second half of this year, we expect to start construction at 2900 on First in Seattle, The Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California, and The Sterling and Park Towne Place, both located in Center City, Philadelphia. And we plan to invest a total of $400 million in these 10 projects, with $125 million to $150 million this year, and the balance over the next 2 to 3 years. We expect these projects to generate current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rate of returns in excess of 10%. A deep pipeline of additional opportunities within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year exists.
Regarding the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expected to meet by the end of 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of less than 7x and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. 
Since our last earnings call, Aimco has made significant progress toward these targets with the redemption of more than $300 million of preferred stock during the second quarter and redemption of an additional $300 million in July. Our current and projected coverages for this year on a pro forma basis are as follows: debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 8.2x currently and 7.7x by year end; EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of 2.2x currently and 2.3x by year end. 
Most importantly, we now expect to achieve our leverage target of debt and preferred equity to EBITDA by early 2014, almost 2 years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings. Preferred stock redemptions were funded by 2 common stock offerings and option exercises during the second quarter and the exercise of a greenshoe in early July, which generated net proceeds to Aimco of approximately $642 million. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares at an average price of $26.53.
Through these transactions, we expect annual FFO and AFFO to increase by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. Our guidance revisions announced last night take into account the impact for 2012, which is a decrease of $0.01 for FFO and an increase of $0.05 for AFFO. As Terry mentioned, in keeping with its focus on growing dividends with AFFO, Aimco's board increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20, effective with our next dividend this month.
In addition to the increase in FFO and AFFO from our equity offerings, we expect to further increase earnings in each of the next few years due to activity with our property debt. Each year, we amortize approximately $80 million of property debt using retained earnings. This equates to about $0.03 of increased earnings each year. In addition, we have between $200 million and $300 million of debt coming due in each of the next 3 years. Refinancing these maturities at today's interest rates equates to an average of $0.03 of additional interest savings in each of the next several years. 
Finally, going back to our portfolio, we have discussed our interest in potentially accelerating sales anticipated for the next couple of years into 2012. One of our identified use of proceeds, the redemption of high-cost preferred equity, no longer exists. That said, if a compelling opportunity presents itself for the sale of some or all of the contemplated assets, we'll certainly give it consideration and compare its merits to the potential use of such proceeds.
Finally, as to guidance, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.78 to $1.86 per share and AFFO of $1.30 to $1.38 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store net operating income growth of 6% to 7%, which is unchanged at the midpoint. We have narrowed our revenue guidance to an increase in revenues of 4.75% to 5.25%, unchanged at the midpoint, and we have updated our expense guidance with expenses expected to increase 2% to 2.5%, an improvement of 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Affordable Same Store net operating income guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% is a 200 basis point improvement at the midpoint. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range from 5.5% to 6.5%. 
We've also increased our dispositions guidance by $50 million at the midpoint.
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store net operating income growth projected to be 6.5% to 7.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Also we had an outperformance in operations in the second quarter and for the year we've kept our guidance the same. So that's about a $0.01 there, so that was around timing of expenses and some things like that. And then the other $0.01 is just kind of rounding with some things, and so that's why we kept guidance where we did, raising it the $0.02 versus the $0.05."

And we feel like we've got an opportunity to raise rents there through product quality and customer type that we draw into those properties. It's different than if we went in and bought C assets. Nominally, we could take that at a face rate, and say, well, if we had $600 rent, there's more room to raise rents to get up to average. But those $600 rents at a property are reflective of property condition, age, economic obsolescence on the property and other things. And so, again, we feel like on the properties that we're buying, we've got opportunity to have outsized growth. Some of that is related to the submarket, where they're located, and that we feel like we've got submarkets with greater growth potential than those in the submarkets where we're selling.

Let me address a couple of things there. You're absolutely right that we have an acceleration expected with property sales in the second half, but I wouldn't say that it's so much from the Affordable side as it is from the Conventional. And it's actually probably more weighted toward the Conventional, those are bigger assets that will generate larger increases. In terms of the number of properties, it will be more Affordable, but the vast majority of the dollars will be coming from the Conventional side. But you raise a good point, Eric. Ultimately, we look at what do these properties generate from a projected internal rate of return perspective or free cash flow internal rate of return. And even though the cap rates on the Affordable side, the NOI cap rates, tend to be higher, when you factor in all the cash flows from those properties, including capital replacement costs, they come in with free cash flow internal rates of return that are projected well south of 7, usually in the 6 range or maybe a little bit lower. And so what that does mean is potentially some FFO dilution. What it certainly means though is much less and if not maybe slightly accretive to AFFO because we lose that CR. And then importantly, we look at that trade and what are we getting for that. And John kind of described how that works with some of the acquisitions we've done and importantly, the work that Dan Matula is doing on the redevelopment side. And so it could cause some short-term dilution in funds from operations, not so much, if at all, in adjusted funds from operations, but a stronger portfolio and stronger return projections going forward."

We just thought that would be potentially the more efficient way to do it. And importantly, after seeing people at the June NAREIT meeting, just take -- let's take leverage off the table. And we're able to do that by doing the second deal. With regards for the opportunity to do further deleveraging, where we stand today, we like the glide path that we're on, that through property debt amortization, which is about $80 million, $85 million a year through retained earnings as well as projected -- continued NOI growth, in our case NOI growth accelerating as we get into the second half of the year, as you can see from our guidance. It puts us on a path to be about where we want to be in about 18 to 20 months. So we feel pretty good about that.

Last year, in the second half of the year, our occupancy was around 95.2%. So on a year-over-year basis, Mike, we're going to have a nice pickup in occupancy as we projected today of approximately maybe 40 to 50 basis points. So we're going to get some acceleration from maintaining occupancy levels as I've just described. That's going to help somewhat. And then, Keith has given out the information on what's happening with renewal rates and new lease rates. In July, we actually saw our best performance on a blended basis of 5.3. And we feel pretty good that's where, at least going into out of season, we're going to be there. And so that puts us in a good position to have similar rate growth as you saw in our second quarter. So all that math adds up plus what we're doing in other income, to have a second half that's going to be stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis in terms of revenue growth."

Aimco looks at all of its capital decision making using a consistent metric that we call free cash flow internal rate of return. And so that's a mouthful, but what we mean by that is just everything from net operating income to free cash flow. And for consistency and comparability, we subtract $1,200 a unit of capital replacement spending. So in Ernie's talk earlier about adjusting Affordable NOI cap rates to free cash flow, it means that free cash flow is a significantly lower number, particularly at lower price points. Then we look at it as an internal rate of return, adjusting it for expected growth, generally relying on an average of data providers for the particular submarket. And then very importantly, we adjust the exit cap rate to reflect the fact that today's cap rates are influenced by the very high rent growth that we're all now enjoying. But over a longer period of time, it's more conservative to -- not to predict that, but to predict something like the 20-year average. So we use that measure. And what would motivate us to sell either one asset or large portfolio of assets would be our opportunity to redeploy the capital at a higher, risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And so, I wouldn't want you to take away from Ernie's comments the sense that there's a large transaction pending, that's not the case. But we are in the market actively. John underwrites 1 or 2 or 3 transactions a week. We look at opportunities large and small. And if we found the right circumstance, where we could sell lower rated assets at a free cash flow internal rate of return, which I think is probably averaged sub 7 since the start of the year and redeploy it at a free flow internal rate of return in higher quality assets, north of 8 going forward, something like that spread might be attractive to us."

During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. During the second quarter, we earned FFO of $0.46 per share. That's up 10% year-over-year. And we earned AFFO of $0.34 per share, that's up 17% year-over-year. 
The operating team led by Keith maintained high occupancy while increasing rents, with new and renewal rents averaging 5% higher than rents on expiring leases.
The 12-month leases, the hard work of Keith and his team, locks in today a revenue base supporting the growth we expect over the next year. Keith's team also excelled in cost discipline, particularly in the area of labor utilization, as you can see in the 8% year-over-year decline in payroll costs. Importantly, we maintained a healthy level of capital investment and maintenance spending. Our properties are in good condition, as you can see from the rising rents they command. Our portfolio gets better and better. Its average revenue per unit was about $1,300 in the second quarter. This important measure of portfolio quality determined and paid by customers was up about 8% year-over-year, about 1/2 due to rent growth and 1/2 due to acquisition and redevelopment of higher rent properties funded by the sale of lower rated properties. Cash from the sale of lower rated properties was used to fund redevelopment activity and 3 property acquisitions. Average monthly revenue per unit for the properties sold year-to-date was about $740. Average monthly revenue per unit for our 3 acquisitions year-to-date is about $1,400, almost twice. And average un-trended monthly revenue per unit for year-to-date redevelopment starts is expected to be about $2,100, or nearly 3x the rate of the properties sold. As I said, our portfolio gets better and better. 
Our redevelopment business headed by Dan Matula is ramping up, and the 5 projects we have under way are on track. We expect these projects, together with 5 others to be started later this year, to add about $2 per share in net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.
Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. Year-to-date through July, we reduced total leverage by more than $0.5 billion, about $600 million from redemption of preferred stocks, with increases in property debt from acquisitions, including limited partner transactions, almost offset by monthly amortization and asset sales. As a result, and with steady earnings growth, we reduced leverages of multiple of current quarter EBITDA from 9.5 at the start of the year to just over 8 today. We're on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 18 months or so.
Our business strategy is simple: own and operate apartments in a cross section of large U.S. markets and upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower rated properties. Through this end, we've announced plans to exit the Asset Management business by sale of NAPICO later this year and to largely exit the Affordable business by sale of individual properties over the next 5 years or so. We're on track to execute both decisions. Through simplification, we expect higher quality earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparency. 
In January, the Aimco Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.18. Meeting this week, the board raised the dividend again, this time to $0.20 per share, still below a 60% payout ratio. In sum, business is good. We have a capable management team and outstanding teammates, both on-site and off-site. We're working hard and working well together to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions. We're making solid progress in our plans to create shareholder value over the longer term.
Now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

As we closed out the first half of 2012, we successfully improved upon our first quarter start with our second quarter results. Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.6% year-over-year, up 4.4% year-to-date and up 1% compared to the first",561,"Thanks, Terry. As we closed out the first half of 2012, we successfully improved upon our first quarter start with our second quarter results. Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.6% year-over-year, up 4.4% year-to-date and up 1% compared to the first quarter. We're pleased with our overall performance and particularly with our ability to grow year-over-year revenues from one quarter to the next. 
Keeping with revenue for a moment. Second quarter blended rates were up 5%, with new leases up 4.3% and renewals up 5.7% on a lease-to-lease basis. New, renewal and blended lease rates all improved sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of 2012 and creates a book of business that will earn in this fall and into 2013. 
During July, these rates continued their positive momentum. Blended lease rates were up 5.3%, with new lease rates up 4.5% and renewal rates up 6.3%. July's average daily occupancy was 94.9% on par with June's result. August and September renewal offers went out with 7% to 9% increases, and October renewals are going out with 6% to 8% increases, a minimal seasonal adjustment. 
Turnover was 45.7% for the quarter compared to 45.1% for first quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down.
We have not seen any material changes in reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: career moves at 24%, pricing at 21% and purchasing homes at 14%. While we have also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We are successfully replacing our move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 6,900 move-ins during the second quarter with an average income of $87,000, and median income of $60,000 and a rent-to-income ratio of 21.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 240 basis points year-over-year due to increases in taxes and insurance. Property level operating expenses are actually down 1.1% year-over-year. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 5.9%.
Let me provide some market-specific color. Our top 10 markets represent 2/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from 5% to nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Our steady performers for the quarter with midrange growth of 4% to 5% were Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding out the top 10 markets were Orange County at 3.4% and San Diego at 3.3%. Orange County is reaccelerating, with new lease and renewal price increases at 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, over the trailing 4 weeks while simultaneously improving occupancy month-over-month. 
As an update to our expansion in the Bay Area, pre-leasing at our Pacific Bay Vista community is now successfully well underway, with our first occupancy scheduled for later this quarter. We are building upon our second quarter successes with a solid July and setting up well for a solid third quarter and beyond. With great thanks to our team in the field for a strong first half to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share w",1469,"Thanks, Keith. Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.02 from outperformance from property operations, consisting of both higher revenues in our Affordable portfolio and lower expenses in our Conventional portfolio, and $0.03 due to a number of items, including $0.02 related to an unexpected recovery from a previous casualty loss and lower-than-anticipated insurance losses. 
Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties with about 2,200 units, including 5 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.1%. These properties had an average revenue per unit of $825 compared to our portfolio today of $1,290. We also sold 11 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 10.1%. Sales in the second quarter were a mix of higher and lower quality Affordable assets, with the higher quality assets generating cap rates in the range of 6.75% to 8%. 
In June, we acquired a property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for $39 million. The acquisition was funded in part by newly placed nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 42 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $4,000, and its average rents are approximately 38% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through significant capital upgrades in select units and operational improvements. The property debt used to help finance the acquisition is a 10-year note with a local bank at a fixed rate of 3.95%. 
In July, we acquired for $19.7 million a property located in downtown San Diego adjacent to the Gaslamp district. The acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $1,880, and its average rents are approximately 15% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through operational improvements. The property debt assumed has a remaining term of 4.7 years and an interest rate of 5.51%. 
For the year, properties acquired had an average revenue per unit of about $1,400 compared to $740 for our properties sold, helping to further our goal of increasing overall revenues per unit for our portfolio. 
As to redevelopment activities, we described on our last earnings call the 10 projects we expect to have under redevelopment in 2012, which include properties located in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, Chicago, Center City Philadelphia and South Florida. During the second quarter, our team in Chicago began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel at our Elm Creek property. Current market rents for comparable products average approximately $2,950 per unit today, and first occupancy is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
We also continued construction activity at our redevelopment in Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California, and our first residents will move in later this quarter. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and 50 returning residents have moved into those completed units. 
Looking ahead, we are nearing completion of the common area amenity upgrades at The Palazzo in West Los Angeles and expect to deliver these improvements in early September. Additionally, we expect to begin delivering upgraded luxury penthouse units for lease ups in the fourth quarter.
We are set to begin Phase 2 construction at Lincoln Place as soon as the financing is in place, which we expect to be in the third quarter. During the second half of this year, we expect to start construction at 2900 on First in Seattle, The Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California, and The Sterling and Park Towne Place, both located in Center City, Philadelphia. And we plan to invest a total of $400 million in these 10 projects, with $125 million to $150 million this year, and the balance over the next 2 to 3 years. We expect these projects to generate current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rate of returns in excess of 10%. A deep pipeline of additional opportunities within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year exists.
Regarding the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expected to meet by the end of 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of less than 7x and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x. 
Since our last earnings call, Aimco has made significant progress toward these targets with the redemption of more than $300 million of preferred stock during the second quarter and redemption of an additional $300 million in July. Our current and projected coverages for this year on a pro forma basis are as follows: debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 8.2x currently and 7.7x by year end; EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of 2.2x currently and 2.3x by year end. 
Most importantly, we now expect to achieve our leverage target of debt and preferred equity to EBITDA by early 2014, almost 2 years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings. Preferred stock redemptions were funded by 2 common stock offerings and option exercises during the second quarter and the exercise of a greenshoe in early July, which generated net proceeds to Aimco of approximately $642 million. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares at an average price of $26.53.
Through these transactions, we expect annual FFO and AFFO to increase by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. Our guidance revisions announced last night take into account the impact for 2012, which is a decrease of $0.01 for FFO and an increase of $0.05 for AFFO. As Terry mentioned, in keeping with its focus on growing dividends with AFFO, Aimco's board increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20, effective with our next dividend this month.
In addition to the increase in FFO and AFFO from our equity offerings, we expect to further increase earnings in each of the next few years due to activity with our property debt. Each year, we amortize approximately $80 million of property debt using retained earnings. This equates to about $0.03 of increased earnings each year. In addition, we have between $200 million and $300 million of debt coming due in each of the next 3 years. Refinancing these maturities at today's interest rates equates to an average of $0.03 of additional interest savings in each of the next several years. 
Finally, going back to our portfolio, we have discussed our interest in potentially accelerating sales anticipated for the next couple of years into 2012. One of our identified use of proceeds, the redemption of high-cost preferred equity, no longer exists. That said, if a compelling opportunity presents itself for the sale of some or all of the contemplated assets, we'll certainly give it consideration and compare its merits to the potential use of such proceeds.
Finally, as to guidance, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.78 to $1.86 per share and AFFO of $1.30 to $1.38 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store net operating income growth of 6% to 7%, which is unchanged at the midpoint. We have narrowed our revenue guidance to an increase in revenues of 4.75% to 5.25%, unchanged at the midpoint, and we have updated our expense guidance with expenses expected to increase 2% to 2.5%, an improvement of 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Affordable Same Store net operating income guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% is a 200 basis point improvement at the midpoint. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range from 5.5% to 6.5%. 
We've also increased our dispositions guidance by $50 million at the midpoint.
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store net operating income growth projected to be 6.5% to 7.5%. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Also we had an outperformance in operations in the second quarter and for the year we've kept our guidance the same. So that's about a $0.01 there, so that was around timing of expenses and some things like that. And then the other $0.01 is just kind of rounding with some things, and so that's why we kept guidance where we did, raising it the $0.02 versus the $0.05."

Nominally, we could take that at a face rate, and say, well, if we had $600 rent, there's more room to raise rents to get up to average. But those $600 rents at a property are reflective of property condition, age, economic obsolescence on the property and other things. And so, again, we feel like on the properties that we're buying, we've got opportunity to have outsized growth. Some of that is related to the submarket, where they're located, and that we feel like we've got submarkets with greater growth potential than those in the submarkets where we're selling. And some of it is related to the physical asset itself, either through management enhancements and improvements or through physical improvements at the property."

Let me address a couple of things there. You're absolutely right that we have an acceleration expected with property sales in the second half, but I wouldn't say that it's so much from the Affordable side as it is from the Conventional. And it's actually probably more weighted toward the Conventional, those are bigger assets that will generate larger increases. In terms of the number of properties, it will be more Affordable, but the vast majority of the dollars will be coming from the Conventional side. But you raise a good point, Eric. Ultimately, we look at what do these properties generate from a projected internal rate of return perspective or free cash flow internal rate of return. And even though the cap rates on the Affordable side, the NOI cap rates, tend to be higher, when you factor in all the cash flows from those properties, including capital replacement costs, they come in with free cash flow internal rates of return that are projected well south of 7, usually in the 6 range or maybe a little bit lower. And so what that does mean is potentially some FFO dilution. What it certainly means though is much less and if not maybe slightly accretive to AFFO because we lose that CR. And then importantly, we look at that trade and what are we getting for that. And John kind of described how that works with some of the acquisitions we've done and importantly, the work that Dan Matula is doing on the redevelopment side. And so it could cause some short-term dilution in funds from operations, not so much, if at all, in adjusted funds from operations, but a stronger portfolio and stronger return projections going forward."

We thought, ""Let's take one bite at the apple,"" and we felt confident that would go well and we're pleased with the result. And 40 days later, we saw we had an opportunity to go for a second bite. We just thought that would be potentially the more efficient way to do it. And importantly, after seeing people at the June NAREIT meeting, just take -- let's take leverage off the table. And we're able to do that by doing the second deal. With regards for the opportunity to do further deleveraging, where we stand today, we like the glide path that we're on, that through property debt amortization, which is about $80 million, $85 million a year through retained earnings as well as projected -- continued NOI growth, in our case NOI growth accelerating as we get into the second half of the year, as you can see from our guidance. It puts us on a path to be about where we want to be in about 18 to 20 months. So we feel pretty good about that.

Last year, in the second half of the year, our occupancy was around 95.2%. So on a year-over-year basis, Mike, we're going to have a nice pickup in occupancy as we projected today of approximately maybe 40 to 50 basis points. So we're going to get some acceleration from maintaining occupancy levels as I've just described. That's going to help somewhat. And then, Keith has given out the information on what's happening with renewal rates and new lease rates. In July, we actually saw our best performance on a blended basis of 5.3. And we feel pretty good that's where, at least going into out of season, we're going to be there. And so that puts us in a good position to have similar rate growth as you saw in our second quarter. So all that math adds up plus what we're doing in other income, to have a second half that's going to be stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis in terms of revenue growth."

As I mentioned in my -- in our prepared remarks, we're hopeful that's going to happen sometime before the end of the third quarter, and we can mobilize very quickly right after that within a few weeks and start construction. We'd mentioned in some of our various investor presentations over the last 6 or 7 months, our expected cost to go on that project is about $150 million. We'll provide more specific numbers, specific information around what we think we can achieve for rents, as well as returns, probably later this quarter once we have the financing locked up and we have everything buttoned up.

Aimco looks at all of its capital decision making using a consistent metric that we call free cash flow internal rate of return. And so that's a mouthful, but what we mean by that is just everything from net operating income to free cash flow. And for consistency and comparability, we subtract $1,200 a unit of capital replacement spending. So in Ernie's talk earlier about adjusting Affordable NOI cap rates to free cash flow, it means that free cash flow is a significantly lower number, particularly at lower price points. Then we look at it as an internal rate of return, adjusting it for expected growth, generally relying on an average of data providers for the particular submarket. And then very importantly, we adjust the exit cap rate to reflect the fact that today's cap rates are influenced by the very high rent growth that we're all now enjoying. But over a longer period of time, it's more conservative to -- not to predict that, but to predict something like the 20-year average. So we use that measure. And what would motivate us to sell either one asset or large portfolio of assets would be our opportunity to redeploy the capital at a higher, risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And so, I wouldn't want you to take away from Ernie's comments the sense that there's a large transaction pending, that's not the case. But we are in the market actively. John underwrites 1 or 2 or 3 transactions a week. We look at opportunities large and small. And if we found the right circumstance, where we could sell lower rated assets at a free cash flow internal rate of return, which I think is probably averaged sub 7 since the start of the year and redeploy it at a free flow internal rate of return in higher quality assets, north of 8 going forward, something like that spread might be attractive to us."

John Bezzant and his team continues selling lower rated properties and investing the proceeds in property upgrades redevelopment and a few attractive acquisitions. The business is simpler and more profitable. With better properties and better markets with fewer properties held in partnerships and with higher margins because capital replacement spending is declining as a percent of higher price point NOI. 
construction is ramping up at all 10 properties identified for redevelopment as the start of this year. We expect this will add about $2 per share to net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so. 
The balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. We enjoy ample liquidity. Leverage is down by $700 million year-to-date. We expect year end leverage to fourth quarter EBITDA annualized to be about 7.7 to 1, down 20% year-over-year. We are on track to meet our target of 7 to 1 within the next 15 months or so. We feel good about 2012, and we are optimistic as we make our plans for next year. For more detail on third quarter operations, I'll turn the call to Keith Kimmel. Keith?"

So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerated. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% yea",574,"Thanks, Terry. So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerated. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% year to date and up 1.7% compared to the second quarter. 
Let me provide some additional color on revenue. Third quarter blended rates were up 4.8%, with new leases up 3.8% and renewals up 6% on the lease to lease basis. This sets us up well for this quarter and creates a book of business that will earn-in over the next several quarters well into 2013. As 
we finalize the October, preliminary blended lease rates will be up between 2.5% and 3%. Highlighted by our continued success with renewal rates up close to 5%. New lease rents flattened out and we expect this to improve between 1% and 2% for the entire quarter, demonstrated by our second half of October building north of 1.5%. October's average daily occupancy was 95.3%, 10 basis points better than October 2011's  result. We anticipate occupancy will improve for the balance of the year. 
November and December renewal offers went out to 5% to 7%, and turnover was 46.8% for the quarter compared to 45.5% for the second quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention though we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, also because it allows us to keep our cost down. 
The top 3 reasons for move-outs in the third quarter were career moves and pricing both at 22% and purchasing homes at 12%. The home purchase number represents a 2% decrease from the second quarter. While we've also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents and higher rents. We had 8,300 movements during the third quarter, with an average income of $99,000. The median income 65,000 ad the rent income ratio of 20.7%.
Third quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 50 basis points year-over-year, led by decreases in payroll and offset by increases in technology and also taxes and insurance. The net result of this was year-over-year NOI growth of 7.4%. 
Let me provide some market performance details. 2/3 of our revenue comes from 10 markets. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from over 5%, nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of 4.5% to 5% were Orange County, Austin, Washington D.C., Chicago. Rounding out the top 10 markets was revenue growth between 3% and 3.5%, San Diego, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. 
As you are aware, Hurricane Sandy had an incredible impact on the East Coast of the United States earlier this week. I'm pleased to report that all the thousands of residents and team members in the impacted areas are safe from harm. I want to personally thank the men and women of our property operations and construction services teams for their tireless efforts in ensuring customer service in the face of adversity.
Rebuilding upon the third quarter successes with a solid October setting us up well for a strong finish in 2012 and beyond. With great thanks to our teams in the field for strong quarter, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane San",1458,"Thanks, Keith. Today I will focus on the following 4 topics: Impact of Hurricane Sandy, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities and finally I will provide a guidance update. 
We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane Sandy's impact on our residents and team members was no worse than significant inconvenience. They are still determining the extensive damage caused by the storm, cost assisted will include cleanup expenditures and repairs. The rough estimate currently is $1 million to $2 million in costs of which we anticipate more than half will be covered by insurance proceeds.
As to the portfolio, during the quarter, we sold 22 properties with about 3,900 units, including 8 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 5.9%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $795 compared to our portfolio today of $1,332. We also sold 14 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.0%. 
For the year, the NOI cap rate for our sold properties is 6.5%. The properties sold are among our lowest-rated assets and disproportionately weighted to Affordable properties as we accelerate our exit from that business. Average revenue per unit of the properties sold was $762. Our average revenue per unit for our entire current portfolio is $1,300 per unit. The implied cap rate for our entire portfolio based on our current share price is about 6.6%, higher than what we are achieving on sales. 
As I reported on our second quarter earnings call, we acquired a property located in Downtown San Diego in July. We had no other acquisition activity during the quarter. For the year, properties acquired have average revenues per unit of $1,400 compared to $799 for properties we have sold year-to-date Further our goal of increasing portfolio quality as measured by average revenue per unit. 
We reduced acquisition slightly as we expect now that certain limited partnership transaction closings will move into the first part of 2013. 
On the redevelopment front, as of today, construction is underway at 9 of the 10 projects we expected to begin this year. We plan to start the remaining projects Sterling in Center City, Philadelphia during the fourth quarter. In October we provided details our our Lincoln Place redevelopment. In earlier phase began last year with the redevelopment of 4 buildings with 65 apartment homes. Work was completed earlier this year and 50 apartment homes have been released to returning residents.
Over the next 2 years, we will redevelop the remaining 41 buildings, including 631 now vacant apartment homes, together with common areas and landscaping. We will also construct on now vacant lands 13 new buildings with 99 apartment homes, a leasing center and a fitness center and pool area. This is an important milestone for Aimco, and we are eager to return Lincoln Place to an income-producing asset. 
As to other notable redevelopment activities, the start of construction at Pacific Bay business, our estimates for total project cost has increased to approximately $12.4 million. The increase in anticipated cost is due to changes in scope to prevent moisture intrusion. The changes have delayed delivery of the properties residential buildings and properties leasing center and community center have been completed. 
In September, we completed construction of an exclusive rooftop patio and lounge area and other amenity upgrades at The Palazzo located in West Los Angeles. Redevelopment of the properties 4 Penthouse model units was completed in early October, and we have started the upgrade of the properties 115 Penthouse units on churns. This activity will continue for the next couple of years.
During the third quarter, we began construction at the Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera California. We expect first occupancy in the second quarter 2013 as stabilized rents are expected to average $3,880 per unit not including interim market trends growth. 
Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest a total of $400 million over the next 2 to 3 years in the redevelopment of the 7 projects detailed in our supplemental schedules as well as 2 projects in Philadelphia and 1 in Seattle. Our anticipated investment in redevelopment for 2012 is now $100 million or about $35 million less than our previously provided guidance. The decrease provided us the opportunity to increase our investment in property upgrades by $20 million.
Regarding the balance sheet, as we reported last quarter, we redeemed $300 million of preferred stock in July, contributing to the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. Redemption was funded by our June common stock offering. 
In preferred equity to EBITDA coverage as of the third quarter is 8x. We anticipate that our year end coverage will be approximately 7.7x. As a reminder, our targeted 7x, which we expect to meet in the next 15 months or so through EBITDA growth and amortization of property debt from retained earnings. 
In addition to our target around leverage, we have a goal of creating unencumbered pool of assets to additional financial flexibility and safety to our balance sheet. We started this pool in the third quarter proceeds from our line of credit temporarily to pay off our maturing loans. We will repair our line along with proceeds from other refinancing activity in the coming months.
Lastly, with the closing of our Lincoln Place property loan, one of our larger 2013  property debt maturity was refinanced. These $172 million of property debt coming due in 2013  representing approximately 4% of our outstanding debt. $27 million of this amount of consists of 3 first quarter maturities. We expect to pay off 2 of these loans, increasing our unencumbered pool to approximately $160 million of growth asset value.
Finally, as the guidance, we expect full year pro forma FFO $1.79 to $1.85 per share and AFFO of $1.31 to $1.37 per share. The guidance assumes Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 6.5% which  is unchanged from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter. We expect full year revenue to increase 4.6% when compared to 2011, which is 40 basis points lower than the midpoint we expected last quarter. 
The table on Page 6 of our earnings release shows how this revenue increase has been offset by expense savings. Revenue is expected to decrease 40 basis points, due to both a decrease in previously projected tenant utility reimbursements, which are accounted for in other rental income and our expectation that occupancy will be lower in the second half of 2012 than previously expected. Expenses are expected to be lower 100 basis points due mainly to lower utility costs. These 2 variances offset, maintaining our guidance for NOI growth. 
Specific to expense performance year-to-date as disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 6D, we have been successful in reducing our personal cost by $5 million. As we've discussed previously, we fully implemented a new property management system in 2011, which automates certain tasks were previously competed manually. These savings in personnel is offset somewhat by the related increase in software and technology cost of $1.3 million, also noted on Schedule 6D.
Our current FFO guidance assumes Affordable Same Store NOI growth of 4%, a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So taken together, total same-store NOI growth is expected to be 6% which is unchanged at the midpoint. 
For the fourth, quarter pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.47 to $0.53 per share with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 5% to 6%. Please note that our guidance does not include an estimate for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we won't provide specific guidance for 2013 today and we didn't want to provide some thoughts on revenue growth for next year. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, to the third quarter of 2012, our new and renewal leases are up 4.6% over expiring leases. For the full year 2012, we expect that the new and renewable leases will be up approximately 4% over expiring leases. This decrease from the year-to-date result is due to the typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. 
There are 4 drivers to revenue growth for 2013. One is 2012  leasing activity, which I just described. The second is leasing activity anticipated for 2013. Third parties in our own internal analyses at this time anticipate similar results in 2013 leasing activity to our 2012 results. The third and fourth drivers are occupancy changes and expectations around other income. We will provide a specific range next quarter, but taking into account these 4 drivers, our view currently is that 2013 won't be to different to 2012 with regards to revenue growth for Aimco.

With regard to -- too far ahead of ourselves in terms of providing guidance expenses for 2013, but as we look at our expenses, our largest stress will be around real estate taxes. The real estate taxes each quarter this year has increased over the prior quarter, and we still do expect for 2012  real estate taxes come in around 6% increase year-over-year and year-to-date I believe we are at about 4.4%. So we think as we look at 2013 by far that will be our biggest stress item. Items around software should stabilize out, because we rolled out the system last year. So I would not expect a significant increase nor a significant decrease, it will be about flat in terms of software and technology cost. And importantly on the first, we continue to find ways to be innovative and find different ways to potentially look to keep those costs under control. So for now real estate tax is our biggest concern. Other cost items we feel pretty good about it, but utilities this year was a mild winter, and we had a milder summer in terms of electric usage in the summer. The utilities could be a little bit of a stress point for us next year, but we need to see as we get closer to next quarter and we provide guidance there is what utilities in overall at tax expenses."

And secondly similar too on our Conventional side, we've had so much success on the expense side that we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the year. The beginning of the year across our Conventional portfolio in Affordable, we thought expenses would be going up closer to 2.5%, and our expense experience in the Affordable is similar to our Conventional where now we think it's going to be a 1 -- 1.25 type of increase the expenses.

Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The apartment business is good. The economy continues demand, boosted by low natural gas prices in the early stages of the housing recovery. Better economy",375,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The apartment business is good. The economy continues demand, boosted by low natural gas prices in the early stages of the housing recovery. Better economy plus strong demographics equals solid demand for rental apartments. We expect favorable conditions for the next several years. New supply is increasing in some markets and may well slow down rent growth at the highest price point. This impact in our BB+ portfolio should be muted. 
Buoyed by favorable macro conditions, Aimco is on track to execute it's plans for this year. Operating team led by Keith Kimmel has done a good job in customer satisfaction, measured by a high percentage of lease renewals and a steady increase in renewal rents. The earn in of 2012 leasing provides a solid foundation for rent growth next year. 
Keith's team has been superb in their cost discipline. Operating costs, that is before taxes and insurance, are actually down year-over-year. Our portfolio gets better and better. Average revenue per apartment home is more than $1,300, up 8% year-over-year. John Bezzant and his team continues selling lower-rated properties and investing the proceeds in property upgrades, redevelopment and a few attractive acquisitions. 
The business is simpler and more profitable. With better properties and better markets, with fewer properties held in partnerships and with higher margins because capital replacement spending is declining as a percent of higher price point NOI. 
Under Dan Matula construction is ramping up at all 10 properties identified for redevelopment starts this year. We expect these will add about $2 per share to net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so. 
Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. We enjoy ample liquidity. Leverage is down by $700 million year-to-date. We expect year-end leverage to fourth quarter EBITDA annualized to be about 7.7:1, down 20% year-over-year. We are on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 15 months or so. In sum, we feel good about 2012, and we're optimistic as we make our plans for next year.

So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerated. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% yea",574,"Thanks, Terry. So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerated. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% year to date and up 1.7% compared to the second quarter. 
Let me provide some additional color on revenue. Third quarter blended rates were up 4.8%, with new leases up 3.8% and renewals up 6% on a lease-to-lease basis. This sets us up well for this quarter and creates a book of business that will earn in over the next several quarters well into 2013. 
As we finalize October, preliminary blended lease rates will be up between 2.5% and 3%, highlighted by our continued success with renewal rates up, close to 5%. New lease rents flattened out, and we expect this to improve between 1% and 2% for the entire quarter, demonstrated by our second half of October building north of 1.5%. October's average daily occupancy was 95.3%, 10 basis points better than October 2011's  result. We anticipate occupancy will improve for the balance of the year. 
November and December renewal offers went out at 5% to 7%. And turnover was 46.8% for the quarter compared to 45.5% for the second quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention, though we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our cost down. 
The top 3 reasons for move outs in the third quarter were career moves and pricing, both at 22% and purchasing homes at 12%. The home purchase number represents a 2% decrease from the second quarter. While we've also been tracking move outs to home rental, it's thus far been negligible. Continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents and higher rents, we had 8,300 movements during the third quarter, with an average income of $99,000. The median income $65,000, the rent to income ratio of 20.7%.
Third quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 50 basis points year-over-year, led by decreases in payroll and offset by increases in technology and also taxes and insurance. The net result of this was year-over-year NOI growth of 7.4%. 
Let me provide some market performance details. 2/3 of our revenue comes from 10 markets. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from over 5%, nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of 4.5% to 5% were Orange County, Austin, Washington D.C., Chicago. Rounding out the top 10 markets was revenue growth between 3% and 3.5%, San Diego, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. 
As you're aware, Hurricane Sandy had an incredible impact on the East Coast of the United States earlier this week. I'm pleased to report that all the thousands of residents and team members in the impacted areas are safe from harm. I want to personally thank the men and women of our property operations and construction services teams for their tireless efforts in ensuring stellar customer service in the face of adversity.  We're building upon the third quarter successes with a solid October, setting us up well for a strong finish in 2012 and beyond. 
With great thanks to our teams in the field for strong quarter, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

Today, I will focus on the following 4 topics: impact of Hurricane Sandy; portfolio and redevelopment activities; balance sheet activities, and, finally, I will provide a guidance update. We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane",1470,"Thanks, Keith. Today, I will focus on the following 4 topics: impact of Hurricane Sandy; portfolio and redevelopment activities; balance sheet activities, and, finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane Sandy's impact on our residents and team members was no worse than a significant inconvenience. They are still determining the extent of the damage caused by the storm, costs associated with it will include cleanup expenditures and repairs. The rough estimate currently is $1 million to $2 million in costs, of which we anticipate more than half will be covered by insurance proceeds.
As to the portfolio, during the quarter, we sold 22 properties with about 3,900 units, including 8 low-rated conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 5.9%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $795 compared to our portfolio today of $1,332. We also sold 14 affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.0%. 
For the year, the NOI cap rate for our sold properties is 6.5%. The properties sold are among our lowest-rated assets and disproportionately weighted to affordable properties, as we accelerate our exit from that business. Average revenue per unit of the properties sold was $762. Our average revenue per unit for our entire current portfolio is $1,300 per unit. The implied cap rate for our entire portfolio based on our current share price is about 6.6%, higher than what we are achieving on sales. 
As we reported on our second quarter earnings call, we acquired a property located in Downtown San Diego in July. We had no other acquisition activity during the quarter. For the year, properties acquired have average revenues per unit of $1,400 compared to $799 for properties we have sold year-to-date, helping to further our goal of increasing portfolio quality as measured by average revenue per unit.  We reduced acquisition slightly, as we expect now that certain limited partnership transaction closings will move into the first part of 2013. 
On the redevelopment front, as of today, construction is underway at 9 of the 10 projects we expected to begin this year. We plan to start the remaining projects, Sterling, in Center City, Philadelphia during the fourth quarter. In October we provided details around our Lincoln Place redevelopment. An earlier phase began last year, with the redevelopment of 4 buildings with 65 apartment homes. Work was completed earlier this year, and 50 of the apartment homes have been released to returning test residents. 
Over the next 2 years, we will redevelop the remaining 41 buildings, including 631 now vacant apartment homes, together with common areas and landscaping. We will also construct on now vacant land 13 new buildings with 99 apartment homes, a leasing center and a fitness center and pool area. This is an important milestone for Aimco, and we are eager to return Lincoln Place to an income-producing asset. 
As to other notable redevelopment activities, the start of construction at Pacific Bay Vistas, our estimates for total project cost has increased approximately $12.4 million. The increase in anticipated cost is due to changes in scope to prevent moisture intrusion. Changes have delayed delivery of the property's residential buildings. Property's leasing center and community center have been completed. 
In September, we completed construction of an exclusive rooftop patio and lounge area and other amenity upgrades at The Palazzo located in West Los Angeles. Redevelopment of the property's 4 penthouse model units was completed in early October, and we have started the upgrade of the property's 115 penthouse units on turns. This activity will continue for the next couple of years.
During the third quarter, we began construction at the Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California. We expect first occupancy in the second quarter of 2013, as stabilized rents are expected to average $3,880 per unit, not including interim market trends growth. 
Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest a total of $400 million over the next 2 to 3 years in the redevelopment of the 7 projects detailed in our supplemental schedules as well as 2 projects in Philadelphia and 1 in Seattle. Our anticipated investment in redevelopment for 2012 is now $100 million or about $35 million less than our previously provided guidance. The decrease provided us the opportunity to increase our investment in property upgrades by $20 million.
Regarding the balance sheet, as we reported last quarter, we redeemed $300 million of preferred stock in July, contributing to the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. Redemption was funded by our June common stock offering. 
Our debt in preferred equity to EBITDA coverage as of the third quarter is 8x. We anticipate that our year-end coverage will be approximately 7.7x. As a reminder, our targeted is 7x, which we expect to meet in the next 15 months or so through EBITDA growth and amortization of property debt from retained earnings. 
In addition to our target around leverage, we have a goal to creating unencumbered pool of assets to provide additional financial flexibility and safety to our balance sheet. We started this pool in the third quarter, using proceeds from our line of credit temporarily to pay off our maturing loan. We will repair our lines along [ph] with proceeds from other refinancing activity in the coming months.
Lastly, with the closing of our Lincoln Place property loan, one of our larger 2013  property debt maturities was refinanced due to $172 million of property debt coming due in 2013, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding debt. $27 million of this amount consists of 3 first quarter maturities. We expect to pay off 2 of these loans, increasing our unencumbered pool to approximately $160 million of growth asset value.
Finally, as to guidance, we expect full year pro forma FFO of $1.79 to $1.85 per share and AFFO of $1.31 to $1.37 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 6.5%, which  is unchanged from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter. We expect full year revenue to increase 4.6% when compared to 2011, which is 40 basis points lower than the midpoint we expected last quarter. 
The table on Page 6 of our earnings release shows how this revenue decrease has been offset by expense savings. Revenue is expected to decrease 40 basis points, due to both a decrease in previously projected tenant utility reimbursements, which are accounted for in other rental income and our expectation that occupancy will be lower in the second half of 2012 than previously expected. Expenses are expected to be lower 100 basis points due mainly to lower utility costs. These 2 variances offset, maintaining our guidance for NOI growth. 
Specific to expense performance year-to-date, as disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 6D, we have been successful in reducing our personnel cost by $5 million. As we've discussed previously, we fully implemented a new property management system in 2011, which automates certain tasks were previously competed manually. These savings in personnel is offset somewhat by the related increase in software and technology cost of $1.3 million, also noted on Schedule 6D.
Our current FFO guidance assumes Affordable Same Store NOI growth of 4%, a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So taken together, total same-store NOI growth is expected to be 6% which is unchanged at the midpoint. 
For the fourth, quarter pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.47 to $0.53 per share with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 5% to 6%. Please note that our guidance does not include an estimate for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we won't provide specific guidance for 2013 today, and we didn't want to provide some thoughts on revenue growth for next year. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, to the third quarter of 2012, our new and renewal leases are up 4.6% over expiring leases. For the full year 2012, we expect that the new and renewable leases will be up approximately 4% over expiring leases. This decrease from the year-to-date result is due to the typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. 
There are 4 drivers to revenue growth for 2013, one is 2012  leasing activity, which I just described. The second is leasing activity anticipated for 2013. Third parties in our own internal analyses at this time anticipate similar results in 2013 leasing activity to our 2012 results. The third and fourth drivers are occupancy changes and expectations around other income. We'll provide a specific range next quarter, but taking into account these 4 drivers, our view currently is that 2013 won't be too different to 2012 with regards to revenue growth for Aimco.

With regard to -- well, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of providing guidance -- turn around expenses for 2013. But as we look our expenses, our largest stress will be around real estate taxes. Real estate tax at each quarter this year has increased over the prior quarter, and we still do expect for 2012  real estate taxes to come in around 6% increase year-over-year. And year-to-date, I believe we're about 4.4%. So we think as we look at 2013, by far, that will be our biggest stress item. Items around software should stabilize out, because we rolled out the system last year. And so I would not expect a significant increase nor a significant decrease. It should be about flat in terms of software and technology side. And importantly on the personnel side, we continue to find ways to be innovative and find different ways to potentially look to keep those costs under control. So real estate tax is our biggest concern. Other cost items, we feel pretty good about. Some utilities of [ph] this year was a mild winter, and we had a milder summer in terms of electric usage in the summer. The utilities could be a little bit of a stress point for us next year, but we'll just need to see as we get closer to next quarter, and we provide guidance there as what could happen with utilities and overall at tax expenses."

Better economy",377,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The apartment business is good. The economy continues to mend, boosted by low natural gas prices and the early stages of a housing recovery. Better economy plus strong demographics equals solid demand for rental apartments. We expect favorable conditions for the next several years. New supply is increasing in some markets and may well slow down rent growth at the highest price points. This impact in our BB+ portfolio should be muted. 
Buoyed by favorable macro conditions, Aimco is on track to execute its plans for this year. Operating team led by Keith Kimmel has done a good job in customer satisfaction, measured by a high percentage of lease renewals and a steady increase in renewal rents. The earn in of 2012 leasing provides a solid foundation for rent growth next year. 
Keith's team has been superb in their cost discipline. Operating costs, that is before taxes and insurance, are actually down year-over-year. Our portfolio gets better and better. Average revenue per apartment home is more than $1,300, up 8% year-over-year. John Bezzant and his team continues selling lower-rated properties and investing the proceeds in property upgrades,  [indiscernible] redevelopment and a few attractive acquisitions. 
The business is simpler and more profitable. With better properties and better markets, with fewer properties held in partnerships and with higher margins because capital replacement spending is declining as a percent of higher price point NOI. 
Under Dan Matula construction is ramping up at all 10 properties identified for redevelopment starts this year. We expect these will add about $2 per share to net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so. 
Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. We enjoy ample liquidity. Leverage is down by $700 million year-to-date. We expect year-end leverage to fourth quarter EBITDA annualized to be about 7.7:1, down 20% year-over-year. We are on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 15 months or so. In sum, we feel good about 2012, and we're optimistic as we make our plans for next year. 
For more detail on third quarter operations, I'll turn the call to Keith Kimmel. Keith?"

So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerating. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% ye",577,"Thanks, Terry. So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerating. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% year to date and up 1.7% compared to the second quarter. 
Let me provide some additional color on revenue. Third quarter blended rates were up 4.8%, with new leases up 3.8% and renewals up 6% on a lease-to-lease basis. This sets us up well for this quarter and creates a book of business that will earn in over the next several quarters and well into 2013. 
As we finalize October, preliminary blended lease rates will be up between 2.5% and 3%, highlighted by our continued success with renewal rates up close to 5%. New lease rents flattened out, and we expect this to improve between 1% and 2% for the entire quarter, demonstrated by our second half of October building north of 1.5%. October's average daily occupancy was 95.3%, 10 basis points better than October 2011's result. We anticipate occupancy will improve for the balance of the year. 
November and December renewal offers went out at 5% to 7%. And turnover was 46.8% for the quarter compared to 45.5% for the second quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention, as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down. 
The top 3 reasons for move outs in the third quarter were career moves and pricing, both at 22% and purchasing homes at 12%. The home purchase number represents a 2% decrease from the second quarter. While we've also been tracking move outs to home rental, it's thus far been negligible. We continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents and higher rents. We had 8,300 move-ins during the third quarter, with an average income of $99,000. The median income, $65,000, the rent to income ratio of 20.7%.
Third quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 50 basis points year-over-year, led by decreases in payroll and offset by increases in technology and also taxes and insurance. The net result of this was year-over-year NOI growth of 7.4%. 
Let me provide some market performance details. 2/3 of our revenue comes from 10 markets. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from over 5%, nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of 4.5% to 5% were Orange County, Austin, Washington D.C., Chicago. Rounding out the top 10 markets was revenue growth between 3% and 3.5%, San Diego, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. 
As you're aware, Hurricane Sandy had an incredible impact on the East Coast of the United States earlier this week. I'm pleased to report that all the thousands of residents and team members in the impacted areas are safe from harm. I want to personally thank the men and women of our property operations and construction services teams for their tireless efforts in ensuring stellar customer service in the face of adversity.  We're building upon the third quarter successes with a solid October, setting us up well for a strong finish in 2012 and beyond. 
With great thanks to our teams in the field for a strong quarter, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?"

We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane",1472,"Thanks, Keith. Today, I will focus on the following 4 topics: impact of Hurricane Sandy; portfolio and redevelopment activities; balance sheet activities and, finally, I will provide a guidance update. 
We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane Sandy's impact on our residents and team members was no worse than a significant inconvenience. They are still determining the extent of the damage caused by the storm, costs associated with it will include cleanup expenditures and repairs. The rough estimate currently is $1 million to $2 million in costs, of which we anticipate more than half will be covered by insurance proceeds.
As for the portfolio, during the quarter, we sold 22 properties with about 3,900 units, including 8 low-rated conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 5.9%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $795 compared to our portfolio today of $1,332. We also sold 14 affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.0%. 
For the year, the NOI cap rate for our sold properties is 6.5%. The properties sold are among our lowest-rated assets and disproportionately weighted to affordable properties, as we accelerate our exit from that business. Average revenue per unit of the properties sold was $762. Our average revenue per unit for our entire current portfolio is $1,300 per unit. The implied cap rate for our entire portfolio based on our current share price is about 6.6%, higher than what we are achieving on sales. 
As we reported on our second quarter earnings call, we acquired a property located in Downtown San Diego in July. We had no other acquisition activity during the quarter. For the year, properties acquired have average revenues per unit of $1,400 compared to $799 for properties we have sold year-to-date, helping to further our goal of increasing portfolio quality as measured by average revenue per unit.  We reduced acquisition guidance slightly, as we expect now that certain limited partnership transaction closings will move into the first part of 2013. 
On the redevelopment front, as of today, construction is underway at 9 of the 10 projects we expected to begin this year. We plan to start the remaining projects, Sterling, in Center City, Philadelphia during the fourth quarter. In October we provided details around our Lincoln Place redevelopment. An earlier phase began last year, with the redevelopment of 4 buildings with 65 apartment homes. Work was completed earlier this year, and 50 of the apartment homes have been released to returning residents. 
Over the next 2 years, we will redevelop the remaining 41 buildings, including 631 now vacant apartment homes, together with common areas and landscaping. We will also construct on now vacant land 13 new buildings with 99 apartment homes, a leasing center and a fitness center and pool area. This is an important milestone for Aimco, and we are eager to return Lincoln Place to an income-producing asset. 
As to other notable redevelopment activities, the start of construction at Pacific Bay Vistas, our estimates for total project cost has increased approximately $12.4 million. The increase in anticipated cost is due to changes in scope to prevent moisture intrusion. Changes have delayed delivery of the property's residential buildings. The property's leasing center and community center have been completed. 
In September, we completed construction of an exclusive rooftop patio and lounge area and other amenity upgrades at The Palazzo located in West Los Angeles. Redevelopment of the property's 4 penthouse model units was completed in early October, and we have started the upgrade of the property's 115 penthouse units on turns. This activity will continue for the next couple of years.
During the third quarter, we began construction at the Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California. We expect first occupancy in the second quarter of 2013, as stabilized rents are expected to average $3,880 per unit, not including interim market  [indiscernible] growth. 
Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest a total of $400 million over the next 2 to 3 years in the redevelopment of the 7 projects detailed in our supplemental schedules as well as 2 projects in Philadelphia and 1 in Seattle. Our anticipated investment in redevelopment for 2012 is now $100 million or about $35 million less than our previously provided guidance. The decrease provided us the opportunity to increase our investment in property upgrades by $20 million.
Regarding the balance sheet, as we reported last quarter, we redeemed $300 million of preferred stock in July, contributing to the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. Redemption was funded by our June common stock offering. 
Our debt and preferred equity to EBITDA coverage as of the third quarter is 8x. We anticipate that our year-end coverage will be approximately 7.7x. As a reminder, our target is 7x, which we expect to meet in the next 15 months or so through EBITDA growth and amortization of property debt from retained earnings. 
In addition to our target around leverage, we have a goal to create an unencumbered pool of assets to provide additional financial flexibility and safety to our balance sheet. We started this pool in the third quarter, using proceeds from our line of credit temporarily to pay off our maturing loan. We will repay our line draw with proceeds from other refinancing activity in the coming months.
Lastly, with the closing of our Lincoln Place property loan, one of our larger 2013 property debt maturities was refinanced using [ph] $172 million of property debt coming due in 2013, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding debt. $27 million of this amount consists of 3 first quarter maturities. We expect to pay off 2 of these loans, increasing our unencumbered pool to approximately $160 million of gross asset value.
Finally, as to guidance, we expect full year pro forma FFO of $1.79 to $1.85 per share and AFFO of $1.31 to $1.37 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 6.5%, which  is unchanged from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter. We expect full year revenue to increase 4.6% when compared to 2011, which is 40 basis points lower than the midpoint we expected last quarter. 
The table on Page 6 of our earnings release shows how this revenue decrease has been offset by expense savings. Revenue is expected to decrease 40 basis points, due to both a decrease in previously projected tenant utility reimbursements, which are accounted for in other rental income and our expectation that occupancy will be lower in the second half of 2012 than previously expected. Expenses are expected to be lower 100 basis points due mainly to lower utility costs. These 2 variances offset, maintaining our guidance for NOI growth. 
Specific to expense performance year-to-date, as disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 6D, we have been successful in reducing our personnel cost by $5 million. As we've discussed previously, we fully implemented a new property management system in 2011, which automates certain tasks that were previously competed manually. Our savings in personnel is offset somewhat by the related increase in software and technology costs of $1.3 million, also noted on Schedule 6D.
Our current FFO guidance assumes Affordable Same Store NOI growth of 4%, a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So taken together, total same-store NOI growth is expected to be 6% which is unchanged at the midpoint. 
For the fourth, quarter pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.47 to $0.53 per share with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 5% to 6%. Please note that our guidance does not include an estimate for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.
Finally, we won't provide specific guidance for 2013 today, but we did want to provide some thoughts on revenue growth for next year. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, to the third quarter of 2012, our new and renewal leases are up 4.6% over expiring leases. For the full year 2012, we expect that the new and renewal leases will be up approximately 4% over expiring leases. This decrease from the year-to-date result is due to the typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. 
There are 4 drivers to revenue growth for 2013, one is 2012 leasing activity, which I just described. The second is leasing activity anticipated for 2013. Third parties and our own internal analyses at this time anticipate similar results in 2013 leasing activity to our 2012 results. The third and fourth drivers are occupancy changes and expectations around other income. We'll provide a specific range next quarter, but taking into account these 4 drivers, our view currently is that 2013 won't be too different to 2012 with regards to revenue growth for Aimco.

With regard to -- one, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of providing guidance around expenses for 2013. But as we look at our expenses, our largest stress will be around real estate taxes. Real estate taxes each quarter this year have increased over the prior quarter, and we still do expect for 2012 real estate taxes to come in around 6% increase year-over-year. And year-to-date, I believe we're about 4.4%. So we think as we look at 2013, by far, that will be our biggest stress item. Items around software should stabilize out, because we rolled out the system last year. And so I would not expect a significant increase nor a significant decrease. It should be about flat in terms of software and technology costs. And importantly on the personnel side, we continue to find ways to be innovative and find different ways to potentially look to keep those costs under control. So real estate tax is our biggest concern. Other cost items, we feel pretty good about. I would say on utilities is this year was a mild winter, and we had a milder summer in terms of electric usage in the summer. The utilities could be a little bit of a stress point for us next year, but we'll just need to see as we get closer to next quarter, and we provide guidance there as what could happen with utilities and overall how that impacts expenses."

And so even though that populating -- the baby-boom population is growing. We haven't seen a major shift in demand from that. It's really just being real active with our waiting list, making sure when a unit comes open that we have a fresh waiting list. So we have multiple people who can move in, not potentially 1 or 2 who may have moved to different things. It's just being a little more focused on it and going after that opportunity. So it's not so much a demographic or demand item that has helped us drive that."
