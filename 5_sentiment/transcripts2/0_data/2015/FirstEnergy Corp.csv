For today's call, we are deliberately keeping our prepared remarks rather brief so there will be plenty of time taking your questions at the end. Clearly, the topic many of you will be most interested in is our 2015 earnings guidance, which we made public late last evening. But before moving to that discussion, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tony Alexander for his leadership at FirstEnergy over the past decade. 
Tony guided our company through a dramatic expansion and navigated through one of the most challenging periods in the history of the utility industry. As you know, we also announced last night that Tony's last day will be April 30 and we certainly wish him well as he begins his new chapter in his life and enjoys more time with his family. Since moving into the CEO position on January 1, I've had the opportunity either meet personally or talk with many of you over the telephone. We've had some good two-way conversations over the past couple of months and I want you to know that the entire FirstEnergy team is committed to providing frank and open discussion about the challenges and opportunities we are facing as a company. That's why in light of the recent Pennsylvania rate case settlements, we decided to provide you with our earnings guidance range earlier than originally planned, so you would have a clear sense of what we are expecting this year. 
The 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share is in line with the updated drivers for our utilities business and corporate segment that we provided in November, although some Street expectations have not been adjusted to reflect that information. Looking at consensus estimates, we saw fairly widespread of about $0.50, ranging from $2.60 to over $3.10 and we understand the challenges of modeling FirstEnergy, getting all the moving pieces we have right now. 
Given the disparity between the Street consensus and our 2015 base earnings, we believe it's very critical to ground investment community on earnings sooner rather than later as we reset our utilities around the new growth strategy. 
After today, our focus shifts to customer service driven growth across the Utility segment. In that light, now that we have made our 2015 earnings guidance public, following this call, Irene and her Investor Relations team will be happy to answer your detailed questions about all the disclosures we made yesterday and today, including here in our consolidated report and in our updated fact book. 
In the future, once all the pending rate case proceedings are finalized, modeling our going forward earnings power should be far more transparent. And we hope to better articulate that for you later this year at the analyst meeting, where we expect to provide a growth target for our utilities, as well as an overall strategic update on all 3 of our business segments. 
We continue to believe the initiatives that were put in place during 2014 laid the path for our future growth and success. So let's take several minutes to review the key events of the past year. We successfully launched our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program. Under this program, we will invest billions of dollars with an eye towards serving our customers better. These investments will improve reliability, add resiliency to the bulk electric system and install enhanced physical and cyber security to ensure our assets perform as designed. 
With our multiple rate proceedings, we have also set the stage for similar investments in our regulated businesses and more timely recovery of those investments. The recent major storm events that have impacted FirstEnergy service territory have highlighted indeed for the hardening of our distribution systems.
And of course, in the wake of the polar vortex and other severe weather events last winter, we began taking a former conservative approach in our competitive business to limit risk and focus on greater stability.
We have made good progress on these efforts. Our West Virginia rate case settlement was approved by the state Public Service Commission earlier this month. And we have filed settlements in our Pennsylvania and Ohio rate proceedings that require regulatory approval. We also look forward to closure on the base rate case at JCP&L and remain hopeful that the Board of Public Utilities final decision in that proceeding will appropriately include the $580 million incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms. 
Once that case is finalized, we look forward to working with the BPU to make Jersey Central Power and Light a stronger company going forward. In our ATSI proceeding, we believe FERC's approval of our request to move the forward-looking rates as of January 1 signals support for transmission investments for grid reliability. As we anticipated, FERC accepted it subject to refund and also set hearing and settlement procedures and initiated an inquiry on ATSI's return on equity. We believe that more timely recovery associated with forward-looking rates is a major benefit to us, which outweighs the impact of a potentially modest ROE adjustment. This rate structure for ATSI will provide a much better correlation to our cost as we continue to implement our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan. That plan is comprised primarily of thousands of small customer focused transmission projects and equipment upgrades that can be implemented relatively quickly across our existing 24,000 miles of transmission assets. These projects are designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency for our customers while providing long-term and sustainable growth for FirstEnergy. 
I strongly believe that the right investments are those that customers value and are willing to pay for and that provide attractive returns for our investors. It's gratifying to report on a successful first year of that program. We overcame some weather-related setbacks early in the year, but by December, we successfully completed our plan of $1.4 billion in new investments, spanning more than 1,100 projects. You can see the impact of that investment when you look at our financial disclosures for the Transmission segment. 
The plan for 2015 calls for an additional $970 million investment across 430 projects, including 1,000 pieces of substation equipment and 300,000 transmission lines. By the end of this year, we expect to be well on track to meet our 4-year goal of $4.2 billion in investments through 2017. Key projects for 2015 include construction of a new substation and transmission line near Clarksburg, West Virginia to support an existing gas processing plant and reinforce the regional grid. 
We're also planning construction of a new transmission sub-station near Pennsylvania that will support low growth and improve service reliability for more than 40,000 customers of West Penn Power. At the EEI Conference last November, we told you that we have identified about $15 billion in incremental transmission projects in 2018 and beyond, providing both improved customer service and their long-term and sustainable growth platform for our company. 
Let's shift gears now and look at our competitive business. Gadgets we continue to take with regard to our more conservative strategy have been very effective at reducing the overall risk in this business. While our open position is subject to market movement, we are structuring the business to be more predictable and self-sustaining. Our conservative approach will better protect us in the event of extreme weather on unplanned outages at major generating facility. We are projecting this business to be cash flow positive each year over to 2015 through 2018 period, using conservative assumptions. 
I've been asked numerous times about the possibility of divesting this business. Frankly, at this point in time, it doesn't make sense while we were at or hopefully near the bottom of the market, to sell these assets at the lowest value they will likely ever have. In addition, capacity market reforms and pending changes to the treatment of demand response are likely to provide near-term value for this business. Once these moving pieces play out, we should have a much better picture of what we can expect from our competitive business going forward.  At this point, it remains a core business for FirstEnergy. However, we continue to monitor closely the financial performance of some of our individual generating units, particularly those located in Western PJM. While the low market revenue are built into our financial models, several of our units continue to struggle to run economically. 
The strategies we have in place in all 3 of our business segments are sound. They are the right priorities for our company at this time and in this environment and we will continue to refine them as conditions require or opportunities emerge. Along the way, we intend to provide clear communication about our challenges, opportunities, strategies and goals. I'm sure you have many questions at the end of this call and we have a full investor meeting scheduled coming up. I will make myself available as often as necessary to ensure we address all of your questions. I also hope to get to know many of you more in the next several months. For those of you who are not yet familiar with my style, I was trained as an engineer to solve problems. My career at FirstEnergy has been focused on customers and looking for sound, long-term regions. Our distribution and transmission businesses have been  my main focus, although I have the opportunity to oversee our competitive business for a couple of years as well. As I mentioned earlier, in my mind, the best investments, like the ones we're making in our transmission business are those that provide both customers and shareholders with real value. It's our responsibility to provide customers with safe, reliable, affordable and clean electricity and my philosophy is the commitment to these principles reflect in both our decision-making and our management style is good business. 
Lastly, I believe very strongly in transparent communications, whether to employees, customers, regulators or the financial community, that means saying what we know, when we know it. That's why we decided the right earnings guidance sooner than originally expected. Looking forward, we will remain focused on long-term shareholder value, executing our regulated growth plans and taking a conservative approach to our competitive business. At the same time, we will continue to evolving to meet the needs of our customers who rely on electricity to power their businesses and every day lives. My priority to move FirstEnergy to its next period of growth and success, benefiting our customers, employees and investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a short review of 2014 financial results and additional details on our earnings guidance. Following Jim's remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and we should have ample time to address whatever you would like to talk about."
293515,284650226,764470,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter a",911,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter and a solid year overall with numerous achievements. And somewhat of a change in the past practice, I won't cover the results for the quarter in detail by segment as that information is available in the consolidated report or from our IR team. Instead, I will speak to the major drivers and events while leaving more time for Q&A. 
For the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP results were a loss of $0.73 per share. This includes special items of $1.53 per share, of which $1.23 is related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment and as a non-cash item. This adjustment primary reflects a 75 basis points decline in the discount rate than revise mortality assumptions used to measure our obligation. 
Moving now to our fourth quarter operating earnings drivers. Consistent with the guidance we provided at EEI in November, the FirstEnergy consolidated effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, predominantly reflecting a tax benefit associated with the resolution of state tax position. This drove a quarter-over-quarter benefit of $0.12 per share, of which $0.10 was included in the corporate segment. 
At our regulated utilities, overall distribution deliveries decreased fourth quarter earnings, $0.01 per share, total deliveries were down slightly primarily driven by milder weather, which drove a 2.5% reduction in residential sales quarter-over-quarter. Industrial sales were up 1.8%, that's 6 consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. 
On the transmission side, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.14 per share, in line with our expectations as we ramped up our Energizing the Future initiative. At our competitive operations, results came in slightly better than expected for the quarter. Commodity margin was down $0.08 per share, primarily due to lower contract sales that resulted from the change in retail strategy, as well as mild weather. These factors were partially offset by higher capacity revenues related to the increase in the auction clearing prices. 
Let's move now to a short overview of some of the key earnings drivers for 2014, which included a 6% earnings improvement in our transmission segment year-over-year as we've launched our Energizing the Future initiative. On the competitive side of the business, we experienced a year-over-year earnings decline of $0.51 per share due to extreme weather events or early in 2014, partially offset by the actions we put into place your position our sales portfolio and effectively hedge our generation by reducing weather sensitive load. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million, in line with our expectations. At our regulated distribution utilities, we reported 2014 operating earnings of $1.93 per share, in line with the midpoint guidance we provided the November. We saw the full benefit of the West Virginia asset transfer, but also rising expenses for maintenance, depreciation, general taxes and interest without commensurate recovery in rates. However, as Chuck said, the rates that we expect to be effective in 2015 will reset the baseline for a majority of our utilities. 
Distribution deliveries increased 1% compared to 2013 on both an actual and weather adjusted basis. Industrial sales were up each quarter and ended the year up 2%. At our Corporate segment, we benefited from multiple tax initiatives and ended the year with an effective income tax rate of 29.3%. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 37% to 38% in 2015. 
Let's now move to a discussion of some of the 2015 operating earnings guidance details. On the regulated utility side, which is where we believe most estimates did not fully account for the increases in ongoing expenses such as depreciation, interest and taxes, we expect a midpoint of $1.82 per share. This includes new rigs in West Virginia, which will be effective this month and our expectation for new rates in Pennsylvania, which will be effective in May based on the pending settlement. For New Jersey, we assume revenues neutral to 2014 level, but included $0.08 per share for amortization of storm cost for both in 2011 and 2012 storms. 
We expect moderate low growth and distribution sales of about 1%. Commodity margin at our competitive operations is expected to increase by $0.44 per share in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher ATSI capacity prices. For 2015, our committed sales currently are $0.67 [indiscernible] competitive business has been revised $875 million to $950 million, a slight decrease from our previous range given the drop in power prices since November. 
At our Transmission segment. This year, we expect an uplift of $0.11 per share related to the implementation of forward-looking formula rate as requested in our FERC filing and higher rate base at both ATSI and Trail. And although FERC has initiated an inquiry related to our ATSI ROE, we anticipate the range for that segment should accommodate the outcome of that process. 
At Corporate, a combination of a more normal effective tax rate, coupled with increased net financing cost is expected to reduce 2015 operating earnings by $0.42 per share, in line with the drivers we provided at EEI. Last evening, we published detailed information regarding our 2015 guidance on our fact book, which is posted on our website. 
With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And also with regard to the RPM auction. I think given the schedule, the way it is now, FES is going to have the bid those units in along with the rest of the competitive generation and it's just kind of a missed opportunity for the utility side to do that.

And when you think about it, we're spending about $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion annually at our distribution company. And we have about $650 million of depreciation. So we're spending more on our depreciation there. So I would look for that type of a consistent increase in depreciation in property taxes. From the transmission side, we showed a increase in depreciation property taxes, about $0.03, '13 to '14. And that was showing the ramp-up of our Energizing the Future program.

Some of our states chose to go to competitive markets. This whole discussion in Ohio is around whether or not we trust regulators better to look out for the long-term interest of customers or whether we trust markets better to look out for long-term interest for customers. Those states that are net importers of generation end up with the highest cost and don't have the ability to optimize between those 3 segments. So if the PPA is successful, we're basically taking those plants and turning it over to the regulators to regulate them again. They all have a chance to look at how we run them, to look at the prudency of our expenses, but we are saying, I think, we trust regulated to look out for the future Ohio more than we did the markets today."

For today's call, we are deliberately keeping our prepared remarks rather brief so there will be plenty of time to take your questions at the end. And clearly, the topic many of you will be most interested in is our 2015 earnings guidance, which we made public late last evening. 
But before moving to that discussion, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tony Alexander for his leadership at FirstEnergy over the past decade.  Tony guided our company through a dramatic expansion and navigated through one of the most challenging periods in the history of the utility industry. As you know, we also announced last night that Tony's last day will be April 30, and we certainly wish him well as he begins his new chapter in his life and enjoys more time with his family. 
Since moving into the CEO position on January 1, I've had the opportunity either to meet personally or talk with many of you over the telephone. We've had some good two-way conversation over the past couple of months. And I want you to know that the entire FirstEnergy team is committed to providing frank and open discussion about the challenges and opportunities we are facing as a company. That's why in light of the recent Pennsylvania rate case settlements, we decided to provide you with our earnings guidance range earlier than originally planned so you would have a clear sense of what we are expecting this year. 
The 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share is in line with the updated drivers for our utilities business and corporate segment that we provided in November, although some Street expectations have not been adjusted to reflect that information. Looking at consensus estimates, we saw fairly widespread of about $0.50, ranging from $2.60 to over $3.10. And we understand the challenges of modeling FirstEnergy, getting all the moving pieces we have right now. 
Given the disparity between the Street consensus and our 2015 base earnings, we believe it's very critical to ground the investment community on earnings sooner rather than later as we reset our utilities around the new growth strategy. After today, our focus shifts to customer service-driven growth across the utility segment. 
In that light, now that we have made our 2015 earnings guidance public, following this call, Irene and her Investor Relations team will be happy to answer your detailed questions about all of the disclosures we made yesterday and today, including here in our consolidated report and in our updated FactBook. 
In the future, once all the pending rate case proceedings are finalized, modeling our going forward earnings power should be far more transparent. And we hope to better articulate that for you later this year at the analyst meeting, where we expect to provide a growth target for our utilities, as well as an overall strategic update on all 3 of our business segments. We continue to believe the initiatives that were put in place during 2014 laid the path for our future growth and success. 
So let's take several minutes to review the key events of the past year. We successfully launched our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program. Under this program, we will invest billions of dollars with an eye towards serving our customers better. These investments will improve reliability, add resiliency to the bulk electric system and install enhanced physical and cyber security to ensure our assets perform as designed. 
With our multiple rate proceedings, we have also set the stage for similar investment in our regulated businesses and more timely recovery of those investments. The recent major storm events that have impacted FirstEnergy service territory have highlighted a need for hardening of our distribution systems. And of course, in the wake of the polar vortex and other severe weather events last winter, we began taking a far more conservative approach in our competitive business to limit risk and focus on greater stability.
We have made good progress on these efforts. Our West Virginia rate case settlement was approved by the state Public Service Commission earlier this month. And we have filed settlements in our Pennsylvania and Ohio rate proceedings that require regulatory approval. We also look forward to closure on the base rate case at JCP&L and remain hopeful that the Board of Public Utilities final decision in that proceeding will appropriately include the $580 million incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms. Once that case is finalized, we look forward to working with the BPU to make Jersey Central Power & Light a stronger company going forward. 
In our ATSI proceeding, we believe FERC's approval of our request to move to forward-looking rates as of January 1 signals support for transmission investments for grid reliability. As we anticipated, FERC accepted it subject to refund and also set hearing and settlement procedures and initiated an inquiry into ATSI's return on equity. We believe that more timely recovery associated with forward-looking rates is a major benefit to us, which outweighs the impact of a potentially modest ROE adjustment. 
This rate structure for ATSI will provide a much better correlation to our cost as we continue to implement our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan. That plan is comprised primarily of thousands of small customer-focused transmission projects and equipment upgrades that can be implemented relatively quickly across our existing 24,000 miles of transmission assets. These projects are designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency for our customers while providing long term and sustainable growth for FirstEnergy. 
I strongly believe that the right investments are those that customers value and are willing to pay for and that provide attractive returns for our investors. It's gratifying to report on the successful first year of that program. We overcame some weather-related setbacks early in the year. But by December, we successfully completed our plan of $1.4 billion in new investments, spanning more than 1,100 projects. You can see the impact of that investment when you look at our financial disclosures for the transmission segment. 
The plan for 2015 calls for an additional $970 million investment across 430 projects, including 1,000 pieces of substation equipment and 300 miles of transmission lines. By the end of this year, we expect to be well on track to meet our 4-year goal of $4.2 billion in investments through 2017. Key projects for 2015 include construction of a new substation and transmission line near Clarksburg, West Virginia to support an existing gas processing plant and reinforce the regional grid. 
We are also planning construction of a new transmission sub-station near Burgettstown, Pennsylvania that will support load growth and improve service reliability for more than 40,000 customers of West Penn Power. At the EEI Conference last November, we told you that we have identified about $15 billion in incremental transmission projects in 2018 and beyond, providing a path to both improved customer service and a long term and sustainable growth platform for our company. 
Let's shift gears now and look at our competitive business. The actions we continue to take with regard to our more conservative strategy have been very effective at reducing the overall risk in this business. While our open position is subject to market movement, we are structuring the business to be more predictable and self-sustaining. Our conservative approach will better protect us in the event of extreme weather or unplanned outages at major generating facility. We are projecting this business to be cash flow positive each year over to 2015 through 2018 period, using conservative assumptions. 
I've been asked numerous times about the possibility of divesting this business. Frankly, at this point in time, it doesn't make sense while we are at, or hopefully near the bottom of the market, to sell these assets at the lowest value they will likely ever have. In addition, capacity market reforms and pending changes to the treatment of demand response are likely to provide near-term value for this business. 
Once these moving pieces play out, we should have a much better picture of what we can expect from our competitive business going forward. At this point, it remains a core business for FirstEnergy. However, we continue to monitor closely the financial performance of some of our individual generating units, particularly those located in Western PJM. While the low market revenues are built into our financial models, several of our units continue to struggle to run economically. 
The strategies we have in place in all 3 of our business segments are sound. They are the right priorities for our company at this time and in this environment, and we will continue to refine them as conditions require or opportunities emerge. Along the way, we intend to provide clear communication about our challenges, opportunities, strategies and goals. I'm sure you have many questions at the end of this call, and we have a full investor meeting schedule coming up. I will make myself available as often as necessary to ensure we address all of your questions. 
I also hope to get to know many of you more in the next several months. For those of you who are not yet familiar with my style, I was trained as an engineer to solve problems. My career at FirstEnergy has been focused on customers and looking for sound, long-term solutions. Our distribution and transmission businesses have been my main focus, although I have the opportunity to oversee our competitive business for a couple of years as well. 
As I mentioned earlier, in my mind, the best investments, like the ones we're making in our transmission business, are those that provide both customers and shareholders with real value. It's our responsibility to provide customers with safe, reliable, affordable and clean electricity. And my philosophy is that a commitment to these principles, reflected in both our decision making and our management style, is good business. 
Lastly, I believe very strongly in transparent communications, whether to employees, customers, regulators or the financial community. That means saying what we know, when we know it. That's why we decided to provide earnings guidance sooner than originally expected. Looking forward, we will remain focused on long-term shareholder value, executing our regulated growth plans and taking a conservative approach to our competitive business. At the same time, we will continue to -- evolving to meet the needs of our customers who rely on electricity to power their businesses and every day lives. My priority to move FirstEnergy to its next period of growth and success, benefiting our customers, employees and investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a short review of 2014 financial results and additional details on our earnings guidance. Following Jim's remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and we should have ample time to address whatever you would like to talk about."
293515,284650226,764823,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter a",917,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter and a solid year overall with numerous achievements. And somewhat of a change to past practice, I won't cover the results for the quarter in detail by segment since that information is available in the consolidated report or from our IR team. Instead, I will speak to the major drivers and events while leaving more time for Q&A. 
For the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP results were a loss of $0.73 per share. This includes special items of $1.53 per share, of which $1.23 is related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment and as a noncash item. This adjustment primarily reflects a 75 basis point decline in the discount rate and revise mortality assumptions used to measure our obligation. 
Moving now to our fourth quarter operating earnings drivers. Consistent with the guidance we provided at EEI in November, the FirstEnergy consolidated effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, predominantly reflecting a tax benefit associated with the resolution of state tax position. This drove a quarter-over-quarter benefit of $0.12 per share, of which $0.10 was included in the corporate segment. 
At our regulated utilities, overall distribution deliveries decreased fourth quarter earnings, $0.01 per share. Total deliveries were down slightly primarily driven by milder weather, which drove a 2.5% reduction in residential sales quarter-over-quarter. Industrial sales were up 1.8%, that's 6 consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. 
On the transmission side, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.14 per share, in line with our expectations as we ramped up our Energizing the Future initiatives. At our competitive operations, results came in slightly better than expected for the quarter. Commodity margin was down $0.08 per share, primarily due to lower contract sales that resulted from the change in retail strategy, as well as mild weather. These factors were partially offset by higher capacity revenues related to the increase in the auction clearing prices. 
Let's move now to a short overview of some of the key earnings drivers for 2014, which included a 6% earnings improvement in our transmission segment year-over-year as we launched our Energizing the Future initiative. On the competitive side of the business, we experienced a year-over-year earnings decline of $0.51 per share due to the extreme weather events early in 2014, partially offset by the actions we put into place to reposition our sales portfolio and effectively hedge our generation by reducing weather-sensitive load. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million, in line with our expectations. At our regulated distribution utilities, we reported 2014 operating earnings of $1.93 per share, in line with the midpoint of guidance we provided the November. We saw the full benefit of the West Virginia asset transfer, but also rising expenses for maintenance, depreciation, general taxes and interest, without commensurate recovery in rates. However, as Chuck said, new rates that we expect to be effective in 2015 will reset the baseline for a majority of our utilities. 
Distribution deliveries increased 1% compared to 2013 on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Industrial sales were up each quarter and ended the year up 2%. At our Corporate segment, we benefited from multiple tax initiatives and ended the year with an effective income tax rate of 29.3%. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 37% to 38% in 2015. 
Let's now move to a discussion of some of the 2015 operating earnings guidance details. On the regulated utility side, which is where we believe most estimates did not fully account for the increases in ongoing expenses such as depreciation, interest and taxes, we expect a midpoint of $1.82 per share. This includes new rigs in West Virginia, which will be effective this month and our expectation for new rates in Pennsylvania, which would be effective in May based on the pending settlement. For New Jersey, we assumed revenues neutral to 2014 levels, but included $0.08 per share for amortization of deferred storm cost for both in 2011 and 2012 storms. 
We expect moderate low growth and distribution sales of about 1%. Commodity margin at our competitive operations is expected to increase by $0.44 per share in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher ATSI capacity prices. For 2015, our committed sales currently are 67 million megawatt hours. Our 2015 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business has been revised $875 million to $950 million, a slight decrease from our previous range given the drop in power prices since November. 
At our transmission segment. This year, we expect an uplift of $0.11 per share related to the implementation of forward-looking formula rate as requested in our FERC filing and higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. And although FERC has initiated an inquiry related to our ATSI ROE, we anticipate the range for that segment should accommodate the outcome of that process. 
At corporate, a combination of a more normal effective tax rate, coupled with increased net financing cost is expected to reduce 2015 operating earnings by $0.42 per share, in line with the drivers we provided at EEI. Last evening, we published detailed information regarding our 2015 guidance on our FactBook, which is posted on our website. 
With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

We now have FirstEnergy supplemental testimony being due on March 2, as well as intervenor testimony and staff testimony on March 27, and hearing is on April 13. Given that we've asked for -- originally asked for an April 8 decision date, obviously, that is not going to happen. But from our standpoint, I still think we are in a good place. Originally, we had asked for the April 8 date to accommodate 2 things. If you think about it from an FES perspective, FES need to know where they have this generation and how to hedge it. So we need it at a reasonable period of time to allow FES to be put into position to sell it and also with regard to the RPM auction. I think given the schedule, the way it is now, FES is going to have the bid those units in along with the rest of the competitive generation. And then there's just kind of a missed opportunity for the utility side to do that. But again, I don't think that a critical thing. It just would have been a nice to have kind of thing. So that's it with respect to the schedule for us. As you may know, AEP has a case dealing with the PPA coming up. I understand the decision will probably come out in the next 2 to 3 weeks or so, and I'm hopeful that will bode well for a decision in our case."

And then you have slightly higher pension expense associated with the mortality tables. So that would grow the reduction in that line. From an increase in what I'd say the depreciation in property taxes. When I look at distribution, that's pretty consistent year-over-year. If you look at '13 to '14 depreciation property taxes, increased about $0.09. We're showing about an $0.08 increase '15 to '16. And when you think about it, we're spending about $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion annually at our distribution company. And we have about $650 million of depreciation. So we're spending more on our depreciation there. So I would look for that type of a consistent increase in depreciation in property taxes. From the transmission side, we showed an increase in depreciation property taxes, about $0.03 '13 to '14. And that was showing the ramp-up of our Energizing the Future program. We spent $1.4 billion in capital in '14. We're expecting to spend just about $1 billion in 2015.

Just in general, how do you see the merchant arm of this business which is, clearly, very different than the rest of the business? How do you see that strategically going forward? Did you see the possibility of a spin-off? Or just in general, how we should think about how you're really looking at this business and what you might do strategically to enhance value?"

And over time, put that business into a position where we can have more flexibility in how we look at it. And then if you can tell me what the market's going to be like in 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, I think I could answer what I would do depending on what that market is like.

The first way is on those forward price curves and we actually had IHS in yesterday to talk to us about their views. And I think for the foreseeable future we're not expecting any significant uptick in those forward price curves, so we are structuring our competitive business around those forwards as we know them. The other side of that coin is, it's the economic development engine that's driving growth in our territory. And over the next few years, we expect to connect over 1,000 megawatts of new load directly attributed to the midstream part of that business. There are discussions underway about up to 3 cracker plants in our region. If any or all of those come to fruition, I think those are the foundation for an  industrial revolution in the part of the country that we serve. So that's the upside long term. The reality, short term, is we expect gas prices to stay fairly low. There is some congestion in the gas markets that's going on right now, but there's also roughly $20 billion worth of gas transmission projects that are under construction and expected to go in service over the next few years that will release some of that congestion and eliminate some of the basis difference between our zone and the rest of the country.

For today's call, we are deliberately keeping our prepared remarks rather brief so there will be plenty of time to take your questions at the end. And clearly, the topic many of you will be most interested in is our 2015 earnings guidance, which we made public late last evening. 
But before moving to that discussion, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tony Alexander for his leadership at FirstEnergy over the past decade.  Tony guided our company through a dramatic expansion and navigated through one of the most challenging periods in the history of the utility industry. As you know, we also announced last night that Tony's last day will be April 30, and we certainly wish him well as he begins this new chapter in his life and enjoys more time with his family. 
Since moving into the CEO position on January 1, I've had the opportunity either to meet personally or talk with many of you over the telephone. We've had some good two-way conversation over the past couple of months. And I want you to know that the entire FirstEnergy team is committed to providing frank and open discussion about the challenges and opportunities we are facing as a company. That's why in light of the recent Pennsylvania rate case settlements, we decided to provide you with our earnings guidance range earlier than originally planned so you would have a clear sense of what we are expecting this year. 
The 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share is in line with the updated drivers for our utilities business and corporate segment that we provided in November, although some Street expectations have not been adjusted to reflect that information. Looking at consensus estimates, we saw a fairly wide spread of about $0.50, ranging from $2.60 to over $3.10. And we understand the challenges of modeling FirstEnergy, getting all the moving pieces we have right now. 
Given the disparity between the Street consensus and our 2015 base earnings, we believe it's very critical to ground the investment community on earnings sooner rather than later as we reset our utilities around the new growth strategy. After today, our focus shifts to customer-service-driven growth across the utility segment. 
In that light, now that we have made our 2015 earnings guidance public, following this call, Irene and her Investor Relations team will be happy to answer your detailed questions about all of the disclosures we made yesterday and today, including here in our consolidated report and in our updated FactBook. 
In the future, once all the pending rate case proceedings are finalized, modeling our going-forward earnings power should be far more transparent. And we hope to better articulate that for you later this year at an analyst meeting, where we expect to provide a growth target for our utilities, as well as an overall strategic update on all 3 of our business segments. We continue to believe the initiatives that were put in place during 2014 laid the path for our future growth and success. 
So let's take several minutes to review the key events of the past year. We successfully launched our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program. Under this program, we will invest billions of dollars with an eye towards serving our customers better. These investments will improve reliability, add resiliency to the bulk electric system and install enhanced physical and cyber security to ensure our assets perform as designed. 
With our multiple rate proceedings, we have also set the stage for similar investment in our regulated businesses and more timely recovery of those investments. The recent major storm events that have impacted FirstEnergy service territory have highlighted a need for hardening of our distribution systems. And of course, in the wake of the polar vortex and other severe weather events last winter, we began taking a far more conservative approach in our competitive business to limit risk and focus on greater stability.
We have made good progress on these efforts. Our West Virginia rate case settlement was approved by the state Public Service Commission earlier this month. And we have filed settlements in our Pennsylvania and Ohio rate proceedings that require regulatory approval. We also look forward to closure on the base rate case at JCP&L and remain hopeful that the Board of Public Utilities’ final decision in that proceeding will appropriately include the $580 million incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms. Once that case is finalized, we look forward to working with the BPU to make Jersey Central Power & Light a stronger company going forward. 
In our ATSI proceeding, we believe FERC's approval of our request to move to forward-looking rates as of January 1 signals support for transmission investments for grid reliability. As we anticipated, FERC accepted it subject to refund and also set hearing and settlement procedures and initiated an inquiry into ATSI's return on equity. We believe that more timely recovery associated with forward-looking rates is a major benefit to us, which outweighs the impact of a potentially modest ROE adjustment. 
This rate structure for ATSI will provide a much better correlation to our costs as we continue to implement our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan. That plan is comprised primarily of thousands of small customer-focused transmission projects and equipment upgrades that can be implemented relatively quickly across our existing 24,000 miles of transmission assets. These projects are designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency for our customers while providing long term and sustainable growth for FirstEnergy. 
I strongly believe that the right investments are those that customers value and are willing to pay for and that provide attractive returns for our investors. It's gratifying to report on the successful first year of that program. We overcame some weather-related setbacks early in the year. But by December, we successfully completed our plan of $1.4 billion in new investments, spanning more than 1,100 projects. You can see the impact of that investment when you look at our financial disclosures for the transmission segment. 
The plan for 2015 calls for an additional $970 million investment across 430 projects, including 1,000 pieces of substation equipment and 300 miles of transmission lines. By the end of this year, we expect to be well on track to meet our 4-year goal of $4.2 billion in investments through 2017. Key projects for 2015 include construction of a new substation and transmission line near Clarksburg, West Virginia to support an existing gas processing plant and reinforce the regional grid. 
We are also planning construction of a new transmission sub-station near Burgettstown, Pennsylvania that will support load growth and improve service reliability for more than 40,000 customers of West Penn Power. At the EEI Conference last November, we told you that we have identified about $15 billion in incremental transmission projects in 2018 and beyond, providing a path to both improved customer service and a long term and sustainable growth platform for our company. 
Let's shift gears now and look at our competitive business. The actions we continue to take with regard to our more conservative strategy have been very effective at reducing the overall risk in this business. While our open position is subject to market movement, we are structuring the business to be more predictable and self-sustaining. Our conservative approach will better protect us in the event of extreme weather or unplanned outages at a major generating facility. We are projecting this business to be cash-flow positive each year over to 2015 through 2018 period, using conservative assumptions. 
I've been asked numerous times about the possibility of divesting this business. Frankly, at this point in time, it doesn't make sense while we are at or hopefully near the bottom of the market to sell these assets at the lowest value they will likely ever have. In addition, capacity market reforms and pending changes to the treatment of demand response are likely to provide near-term value for this business. 
Once these moving pieces play out, we should have a much better picture of what we can expect from our competitive business going forward. At this point, it remains a core business for FirstEnergy. However, we continue to monitor closely the financial performance of some of our individual generating units, particularly those located in Western PJM. While the low market revenues are built into our financial models, several of our units continue to struggle to run economically. 
The strategies we have in place in all 3 of our business segments are sound. They are the right priorities for our company at this time and in this environment, and we will continue to refine them as conditions require or opportunities emerge. Along the way, we intend to provide clear communication about our challenges, opportunities, strategies and goals. I'm sure you have many questions at the end of this call, and we have a full investor-meeting schedule coming up. I will make myself available as often as necessary to ensure we address all of your questions. 
I also hope to get to know many of you more in the next several months. For those of you who are not yet familiar with my style, I was trained as an engineer to solve problems. My career at FirstEnergy has been focused on customers and looking for sound, long-term solutions. Our distribution and transmission businesses have been my main focus, although I have the opportunity to oversee our competitive business for a couple of years as well. 
As I mentioned earlier, in my mind, the best investments, like the ones we're making in our transmission business, are those that provide both customers and shareholders with real value. It's our responsibility to provide customers with safe, reliable, affordable and clean electricity. And my philosophy is that a commitment to these principles, reflected in both our decision-making and our management style, is good business. 
Lastly, I believe very strongly in transparent communications, whether to employees, customers, regulators or the financial community. That means saying what we know, when we know it. That's why we decided to provide earnings guidance sooner than originally expected. Looking forward, we will remain focused on long-term shareholder value, executing our regulated growth plans and taking a conservative approach to our competitive business. At the same time, we will continue to -- evolving to meet the needs of our customers who rely on electricity to power their businesses and everyday lives. It’s my priority to move FirstEnergy to its next period of growth and success, benefiting our customers, employees and investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a short review of 2014 financial results and additional details on our earnings guidance. Following Jim's remarks, we'll open the call to your questions and we should have ample time to address whatever you would like to talk about."

This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter a",918,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter and a solid year overall with numerous achievements. And somewhat of a change to past practice, I won't cover the results for the quarter in detail by segment since that information is available in the consolidated report or from our IR team. Instead, I will speak to the major drivers and events while leaving more time for Q&A. 
For the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP results were a loss of $0.73 per share. This includes special items of $1.53 per share, of which $1.23 is related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment and is a noncash item. This adjustment primarily reflects a 75 basis point decline in the discount rate and revised mortality assumptions used to measure our obligation. 
Moving now to our fourth quarter operating earnings drivers. Consistent with the guidance we provided at EEI in November, the FirstEnergy consolidated effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, predominantly reflecting a tax benefit associated with the resolution of state tax position. This drove a quarter-over-quarter benefit of $0.12 per share, of which $0.10 was included in the corporate segment. 
At our regulated utilities, overall distribution deliveries decreased fourth quarter earnings $0.01 per share. Total deliveries were down slightly primarily driven by milder weather, which drove a 2.5% reduction in residential sales quarter-over-quarter. Industrial sales were up 1.8%, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. 
On the transmission side, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.14 per share, in line with our expectations as we ramped up our Energizing the Future initiatives. At our competitive operations, results came in slightly better than expected for the quarter. Commodity margin was down $0.08 per share, primarily due to lower contract sales that resulted from the change in retail strategy, as well as mild weather. These factors were partially offset by higher capacity revenues related to the increase in the auction clearing prices. 
Let's move now to a short overview of some of the key earnings drivers for 2014, which included a 6% earnings improvement in our transmission segment year-over-year as we launched our Energizing the Future initiative. On the competitive side of the business, we experienced a year-over-year earnings decline of $0.51 per share due to the extreme weather events early in 2014, partially offset by the actions we put into place to reposition our sales portfolio and effectively hedge our generation by reducing weather-sensitive loads. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million, in line with our expectations. At our regulated distribution utilities, we reported 2014 operating earnings of $1.93 per share, in line with the midpoint of guidance we provided the November. We saw the full benefit of the West Virginia asset transfer, but also rising expenses for maintenance, depreciation, general taxes and interest, without commensurate recovery in rates. However, as Chuck said, new rates that we expect to be effective in 2015 will reset the baseline for a majority of our utilities. 
Distribution deliveries increased 1% compared to 2013 on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Industrial sales were up each quarter and ended the year up 2%. At our Corporate segment, we benefited from multiple tax initiatives and ended the year with an effective income tax rate of 29.3%. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 37% to 38% in 2015. 
Let's now move to a discussion of some of the 2015 operating earnings guidance details. On the regulated utility side, which is where we believe most estimates did not fully account for the increases in ongoing expenses such as depreciation, interest and taxes, we expect a midpoint of $1.82 per share. This includes new rates in West Virginia, which will be effective this month and our expectation for new rates in Pennsylvania, which would be effective in May based on the pending settlement. For New Jersey, we assumed revenues neutral to 2014 levels, but included $0.08 per share for amortization of deferred storm costs for both the 2011 and 2012 storms. 
We expect moderate low growth and distribution sales of about 1%. Commodity margin at our competitive operations is expected to increase by $0.44 per share in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher ATSI capacity prices. For 2015, our committed sales currently are 67 million megawatt hours. Our 2015 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business has been revised to $875 million to $950 million, a slight decrease from our previous range given the drop in power prices since November. 
At our transmission segment. This year, we expect an uplift of $0.11 per share related to the implementation of forward-looking formula rate as requested in our FERC filing and higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. And although FERC has initiated an inquiry related to our ATSI ROE, we anticipate the range for that segment should accommodate the outcome of that process. 
At corporate, a combination of a more normal effective tax rate, coupled with increased net financing cost is expected to reduce 2015 operating earnings by $0.42 per share, in line with the drivers we provided at EEI. Last evening, we published detailed information regarding our 2015 guidance on our FactBook, which is posted on our website.

Given that we've asked for -- originally asked for an April 8 decision date, obviously, that is not going to happen. But from our standpoint, I still think we are in a good place. Originally, we had asked for the April 8 date to accommodate 2 things. If you think about it from an FES perspective, FES needs to know where they have this generation and how to hedge it. So we need it at a reasonable period of time to allow FES to be put into position to sell it and also with regard to the RPM auction. I think given the schedule, the way it is now, FES is going to have to bid those units in along with the rest of the competitive generation. And then there's just kind of a missed opportunity for the utility side to do that. But again, I don't think that a critical thing. It just would have been a nice to have kind of thing. So that's it with respect to the schedule for us. As you may know, AEP has a case dealing with the PPA coming up.

And then you have slightly higher pension expense associated with the mortality tables. So that’s what drove the reduction in that line. From an increase in what I'd say the depreciation in property taxes. When I look at distribution, that's pretty consistent year-over-year. If you look at '13 to '14 depreciation property taxes, increased about $0.09. We're showing about an $0.08 increase '15 to '16. And when you think about it, we're spending about $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion annually at our distribution company. And we have about $650 million of depreciation. So we're spending more on our depreciation there. So I would look for that type of a consistent increase in depreciation in property taxes. From the transmission side, we showed an increase in depreciation property taxes, about $0.03 '13 to '14. And that was showing the ramp-up of our Energizing the Future program. We spent $1.4 billion in capital in '14. We're expecting to spend just about $1 billion in 2015. So that $0.11 increase in property tax is really associated with that increased capital and essentially the timing of when it goes into service."

I think as we look at the shale-gas issue, we have to look at it a couple of different ways. The first way is on those forward price curves and we actually had IHS in yesterday to talk to us about their views. And I think for the foreseeable future we're not expecting any significant uptick in those forward price curves, so we are structuring our competitive business around those forwards as we know them. The other side of that coin is, it's the economic development engine that's driving growth in our territory. And over the next few years, we expect to connect over 1,000 megawatts of new load directly attributed to the midstream part of that business. There are discussions under way about up to 3 cracker plants in our region. If any or all of those come to fruition, I think those are the foundation for an industrial revolution in the part of the country that we serve. So that's the upside long term. The reality, short term, is we expect gas prices to stay fairly low. There is some congestion in the gas markets that's going on right now, but there's also roughly $20 billion worth of gas-transmission projects that are under construction and expected to go in service over the next few years that will relieve some of that congestion and eliminate some of the basis difference between our zone and the rest of the country. And that might have a modest change. But all in all, we're planning to run our regulated business around the market forwards as we see them today."

It rebases those utilities and it was a necessary step if we decide to make reliability improvement investments in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has a methodology that's available to us called the DISC that we can make investments. But as I told you when you came in, we got to get through these rate cases first and then we'll make decisions there. And then in my prepared remarks I said, once we get through the base rate case in New Jersey, then I look forward to sitting down with the BPU and working together to figure out how we make JCP&L stronger going forward. In Ohio, we have a DCR mechanism that we have been using to invest in those utilities. So later this year, I know you want numbers, I'm not prepared to give you numbers today.

Those states that are net importers of generation end up with the highest costs and don't have the ability to optimize between those 3 segments. So if the PPA is successful, we're basically taking those plants and turning it over to the regulators to regulate them again. They’ll have a chance to look at how we run them, to look at the prudency of our expenses.

We've got significant amount of our generation that's going to be market-driven generation. That gives us the ability, like I said 2 weeks ago, to say if Mansfield is not in the money, we're not going to run it and lose money. So we're going to optimize it and that optimization is something that we're going to do day in, day out. We're going to do day in -- or kind of more as we look at any options on the retail side as new customer opportunities present themselves. But the goal is, is cash-flow positive and we're there.

We had a good quarter and we are off to a great start for the year. Since our last call in February, we have continued our work to position FirstEnergy for solid, predictable and customer-service-driven aggregate growth. This morning we will talk about our progress on those strategies charges. We will discuss other key initiatives including an important effort that is underway to reduce our cost structure and drive improvements to our balance sheet. And, of course, we will review our first quarter financial results and operational performance. 
Similar to our last call, we intend to keep his prepared remarks brief to allow ample time for your questions before the end of the hour. Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share are slightly above the top-end of our guidance range, and give us a solid foundation start of the year. We benefited from the growth in our transmission business and solid distribution performance that was assisted by second year of unusually cold weather. Our year-over-year results also reflect the actions we began taking in the second quarter of 2014 to reposition the retail sales portfolio and our competitive business. For the past year, we have talked about the extreme weather events of 2014's first quarter and the impact those conditions had on our competitive business and our strategy. The first quarter of 2015 was even colder, with heating-degree days totaling 21% above normal and 2% higher than 2014. The PGM market also set a new winter peak of 144,000 megawatts exceeding the previous winter peak, which was set in January of 2014. In our competitive business, however, the difference in our results between this winter and last is striking. This improvements speaks to the benefit of our more conservative strategy, which includes 3 major components. First, selling no more than we produce in order to maintain an open position of at least 10 million to 20 million megawatt-hours annually to protect against extreme weather, unplanned outages or a combination of both. As a result of our actions to strategically reduce load obligations, our 2015 retail and the polar obligations are expected to be about 68 million megawatt-hours compared to 99 million megawatt-hours in 2014. Second, reducing exposure to weather sensitive load. From January of 2014 to March of 2015, our overall retail obligations are down nearly 35% on an annualized basis, with much of that coming from serving fewer of the most weather-sensitive residential and small commercial customers. And finally, a more rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. This strategy together with improved plant operations helped to mitigate the potential downside from this year's severe first quarter weather and demand conditions. Even though our region experienced 4 more below 0 days this February than last January. As contracts continue to roll off, we expect a further decrease in our annualized retail load obligation through the end of this year and much of the decline will be associated with the most weather-sensitive load. As I have mentioned to many of you previously, we recognized that reducing the risk in the business also means that we are a likely giving up some earnings potential. As we have said, our objective is to make the competitive business more stable as we focus our efforts on growth in the regulated businesses. In that regard, the last few months have been a busy period for our Energizing the Future transmission investment program. We are nearing completion of projects that are designed to maintain service reliability in the wake of plant activations in the northern Ohio. Those plants to cease operations for good on April 15. These projects included the Bruce Mann project, a 195 million, 345 transmission line extending 119 miles from Western Pennsylvania to Suburban Cleveland, scheduled to go in service by June 1.
In addition, we are preparing to energize new 345-kilowatt substation and associated transmission upgrades in Trumbull and Starr counties, which are designed to maintain service rollout reliability in Northern Ohio after the plants are closed. We also continued our work to strengthen the grid to help protected from storms and make network and physical security upgrades. Finally, we are on track with our planned investments on projects that will support the midstream gas operations with about 365 million in the pipeline through 2019.
On the regulatory front, our rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have concluded. In Pennsylvania, we were pleased that the PUC accepted our rate plant settlements for each of our 4 utilities in the state. The new rates, which will be effective on Sunday, will help our operating companies continue to enhance reliability and service to our Pennsylvania customers. We are looking at further options for customer-focus investments going forward, including the option to possibly requested distribution and system improvement charge to recover the cost of those investments. In New Jersey, we received the recovery of approximately $580 million in cost incurred by JCP for 2012 storms and we are glad to have the long process and uncertainty behind us. Now we look forward to working with the BPU as we set a course for our future infrastructure and reliability investments at JC P&L. 
We've had a good and productive start of the year and we are making solid progress toward our long-term goals. Looking forward, there are still 3 major initiatives underway that will ultimately help shape our company and our strategies going forward. First, in Ohio, the hearing on our relative security plan has been delayed by 60 days and is scheduled to begin on June 15. As you know, in its recent decisions on AEP and cases the PUC ruled that stability related to purchase power agreements similar to our proposal are illegal in Ohio. This was an extremely significant outcome. We believe that our filing includes a robust case for how our proposal benefits utility customers and supports economic development in the state. On May 4, we expect to file supplemental testimony to further demonstrate how our plant maids of factors outlined in the AEP and cases. While we are comfortable with the new schedule set by the PUCO, this schedule will help the timing of our analyst meeting, which we had hoped to have this summer. We believe that it makes sense to host this meeting after we receive a decision in Ohio, which pushes us to sometime later this year.
Second open matter that could have a significant impact on our business, is the PJM capacity performance proposal. PJM has addressed questions into the structure of the product. Pending its standardization, FERC granted PGM request to labor to delay capacity auction to no later than the week of August 10. We appreciate the care and long-term perspective that FERC is taking in its review of this important mechanism and expect that both PJM and FERC are interested in reaching a resolution as soon as possible. In both of these matters, we look forward to final outcome that produces better clarity for our company and produces benefits for electric consumers in our region. On a related item, as you know, we have delayed our decision to construct a new dewatering facility for our 2,400 megawatt in Pennsylvania, while we evaluated the plants future, particularly with respect to the results of the next capacity auction. We will continue to monitor market conditions, but given the current environment, including the auction delay, we think it makes sense to move forward with some early aspects of this project. This work is designed to preserve our ability to continue operations of the plant after December 31, 2016. All costs associated with this project are in our current business plan. We, of course, intend to remain sharply focused on those things that we can control, including our own spending on goods and services, operating expenses and other corporate spending as well as capital expenditures. 
Last month, we launched a cash flow improvement projects intending the capture both immediate and long-term savings opportunities that are meaningful and sustainable. A team led by FES Donny Schneider is working to identify savings and process improvements across the company with a particular emphasis on our generation business. The team is focused on expense reductions, capital expenditures and inventory. We're also working with an outside consultant to examine the significant savings potential in our supply chain. 
With more than $2.5 billion in annual spending in the project scope, we believe that significant cost-savings opportunities are available, while continuing to successfully serve the needs of our organization, customers and employees. I will note that workforce and benefit reductions are not included in the scope of the project. In all, we're targeting $50 million in savings this year and an additional $150 million in 2016, reaching a run rate of $200 million by 2017. We expect that the savings will be split about evenly between O&M expenses and capital expenditures, and help us create sustainable levels for the future. By appropriately addressing our cost structure, we can help direct our future and move FirstEnergy to point that are of fundamental operations make the company stronger, while improving the balance sheet overtime. 
We are off to a solid start in 2015. Our early financial results together with our progress on our strategic initiatives are building a solid foundation for the year and for the future of our company. These results and our outlook for the remainder of the year continue to support 2015 operating guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Consistent with the leadership philosophy I've shared with many of you, I would like to narrow the gap between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. While some differences are expected, we are diligently focused on earnings quality. 
Now, we will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our first quarter financial results, and then we will open the call to questions."

Consistent with our approach in the last call, I will use my time today to speak to the major drivers and events of the first quarter. This information is detailed in our consolidated report, which is posted to our website, and we would be happy to address any specific questions in the Q&A or after the call. As Chuck said, this morning we reported strong 2015 first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share, which compares to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, basic and diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.53 per share compared to many 2014 first quarter basic earnings of $0.50 per share or $0.49 per share on a diluted basis. We are off to a good start for the year. First quarter 2015 operating earnings were fairly clean and simple. As expected, we benefited from improvements in our competitive business as well as increased transmission revenue, which were partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in our corporate segment. From the standpoint of our first quarter guidance, we came in above the range we provided, largely due to the impact on our distribution business of extremely cold weather in late February and March. Compared to the normal weather that we include our guidance, first quarter wires revenue benefited by $0.06 per share as a result of heating-degree days that were 21% above-normal during the period. This was offset by about $0.03 per share related to weather impacts in our business. First quarter operating earnings also benefited by a net $0.03 per share compared to guidance, primarily as a result, of the New Jersey storm amortization delay and incremental revenue from our TrAILCo transmission interest. Overall, distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to last year, reflecting the weather as well as modest growth in our customer base offset by the impact of lower average customer use associated with energy efficiency. Residential sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2014, but down 1.7% on weather-adjusted basis or both actual and weather-adjusted commercial sales increased slightly. Industrial sales were also up slightly, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. While soft natural gas prices are deterring some new entrants into the shale gas field, our conservative estimates continue support more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from businesses through 2019. The shale slowdown contributed to softer first quarter demand from the steel sector; however, most of the other key sectors in our region remains solid. 
In our transmission business, first quarter operating earnings were $0.17 per share, reflecting incremental rate-based growth at both ATSI and forward-looking rates at ATSI beginning January 1, this year, partially offset by higher depreciation, taxes and interest expense. As Chuck described, our competitive business was able to more effectively navigate this year's extreme weather conditions, due to the changes we began putting in place during the second quarter of last year. Our 2015 first quarter operating results in this business reflect the benefits of this repositioning and improved plant availability as well as higher capacity revenues. For the 2015, our committed sales currently are about 70 million megawatt-hours essentially having sold everything we anticipated on a retail and forward wholesale basis, with over 8 million megawatt-hours available for spot wholesale sales over the remainder of the year. For 2015, we are also reducing our generation production estimate from about 79 million megawatt-hours down to about 72 million megawatt-hours due to the economic and market conditions we experienced during the first quarter in a market price outlook for the balance of 2015. If it is more economic for us to purchase power from market to serve load when needed, we will do so, but we have the benefit of our own generating resources if and when we need to call on them. Ultimately, market conditions will determine how much we generate from the fleet and how much purchase. Essentially, we will source the power to meet our retail load obligations as economically as possible. For 2016, approximately 70% of our projected sales are committed. Based on our results for the first quarter, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million, as well as our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range of $750 million to $850 million. Consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year, corporate consolidated effective tax rate was 38.8% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This change drove an $0.08 per share decrease in the corporate segment compared to last year and reflects the elimination of certain future tax liabilities associated with basis differences in the first quarter of 2014. 
This year is off to a solid start and we are executing our plans to improve our company's fundamentals and drive long-term shareholder value through customer-focused growth. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share and are also providing a second quarter operating earnings range of $0.42 to $0.50 per share. With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

We had a good quarter and we're off to a great start for the year. Since our last call in February, we have continued our work to position FirstEnergy for solid, predictable and customer service driven regulated growth. 
This morning, we will talk about our progress on those strategies. We will discuss other key initiatives, including an important effort that is underway to reduce our cost structure and drive improvements to our balance sheet. And of course, we will review our first quarter financial results and operational performance. 
Similar to our last call, we intend to keep these prepared remarks brief to allow ample time for your questions before the end of the hour. 
Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share are slightly above the top end of our guidance range and give us a solid foundation to start of the year. We benefited from the growth in our Transmission business and solid distribution performance that was assisted by second year of unusually cold weather. Our year-over-year results also reflect the actions we began taking in the second quarter of 2014 to reposition the retail sales portfolio in our competitive business. 
For the past year, we have talked about the extreme weather events of 2014's first quarter and the impact those conditions had on our competitive business and our strategy. The first quarter of 2015 was even colder, with heating-degree days totaling 21% above normal and 2% higher than 2014. The PJM market also set a new winter peak of 144,000 megawatts, exceeding the previous winter peak which was set in January of 2014. 
In our competitive business, however, the difference in our results between this winter and last is striking. This improvement speaks to the benefit of our more conservative strategy, which includes 3 major components. First, selling no more than we produce in order to maintain an open position of at least 10 million to 20 million megawatt-hours annually to protect against extreme weather, unplanned outages or a combination of both. As a result of our actions to strategically reduce load obligations, our 2015 retail and polar obligations are expected to be about 68 million megawatt-hours compared to 99 million megawatt-hours in 2014. 
Second, reducing exposure to weather-sensitive load. From January of 2014 through March of 2015, our overall retail obligations are down nearly 35% on an annualized basis, with much of that coming from serving fewer of the most weather-sensitive residential and small commercial customers. 
And finally, a more rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. This strategy, together with improved plant operations, helped to mitigate the potential downside from this year's severe first quarter weather and demand conditions even though our region experienced 4 more below 0 days this February than last January. 
As contracts continue to roll off, we expect a further decrease in our annualized retail load obligation through the end of this year, and much of the decline will be associated with the most weather-sensitive load. 
As I have mentioned to many of you previously, we recognize that reducing risk in the business also means that we're likely giving up some earnings potential. But as we have said, our objective is to make the competitive business more stable as we focus our efforts on growth in the regulated businesses. In that regard, the last few months have been a busy, busy period for our Energizing the Future transmission investment program. 
We are nearing completion of projects that are designed to maintain service reliability in the wake of plant deactivations in the Northern Ohio. Those plants ceased operations for good on April 15. These projects included the Bruce Mansfield-Glenwillow project, a $195 million, 345 kilovolt transmission line extending 119 miles from Western Pennsylvania to Suburban Cleveland scheduled to go in service by June 1.
In addition, we are preparing to energize new 345-kilovolt substations and associated transmission upgrades in Wood, Trumbull and Stark counties, which are designed to maintain service rollout reliability in Northern Ohio after the plants are closed. We also continued our work to strengthen the grid to help protect it from storms and make network and physical security upgrades. 
Finally, we are on track with our planned investments on projects that will support the midstream gas operations with about $365 million in the pipeline through 2019.
On the regulatory front, our rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have concluded. In Pennsylvania, we were pleased that the PUC accepted our rate plan settlements for each of our 4 utilities in the state. The new rates, which will be effective on Sunday, will help our operating companies continue to enhance reliability and service to our Pennsylvania customers. We are looking at further options for customer-focused investments going forward, including the option to possibly request a distribution system improvement charge to recover the cost of those investments. 
In New Jersey, we received recovery of approximately $580 million in cost incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms, and we are glad to have the long process and uncertainty behind us. Now we look forward to working with the BPU as we set a course for our future infrastructure and reliability investments at JCP&L. 
We have had a good and productive start to the year and we are making solid progress toward our long-term goals. Looking forward, there are still 3 major initiatives underway that will ultimately help shape our company and our strategies going forward. 
First, in Ohio, the hearing on our electric security plan has been delayed by 60 days and is scheduled to begin on June 15. As you know, in its recent decisions on the AEP and Duke cases, the PUCO ruled that stability riders related to purchase power agreements similar to our proposal are legal in Ohio. This was an extremely significant outcome. We believe that our filing includes a robust case for how our proposal benefits utility customers and supports economic development in the state. On May 4, we expect to file supplemental testimony to further demonstrate how our plan meets the factors outlined in the AEP and Duke cases. 
While we are comfortable with the new schedule set by the PUCO, this schedule will affect the timing of our analyst meeting which we had hoped to have this summer. We believe that it makes sense to host this meeting after we receive a decision in Ohio, which pushes us to sometime late this year.
The second open matter that could have a significant impact on our business is the PJM capacity performance proposal. PJM has addressed FERC's questions into the structure of the product. Pending its final decision, FERC granted PJM's requested waiver to delay the May capacity auction to no later than the week of August 10. We appreciate the care and long-term perspective that FERC is taking in its review of this important mechanism and expect that both PJM and FERC are interested in reaching a resolution as soon as possible. In both of these matters, we look forward to a final outcome that produces better clarity for our company and produces benefits for electric consumers in our region. 
On a related item, as you know, we had delayed our decision to construct a new dewatering facility for our 2,400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield plant in Pennsylvania while we evaluated the plants future, particularly with respect to the results of the next capacity auction. We will continue to monitor market conditions, but given the current environment, including the auction delay, we think it makes sense to move forward with some early aspects of this project. This work is designed to preserve our ability to continue operations of the plant after December 31, 2016. All costs associated with this project are in our current business plan. 
We of course intend to remain sharply focused on those things we can control, including our own spending on goods and services, operating expenses and other corporate spending as well as capital expenditures. 
Last month, we launched a cash flow improvement project intending to capture both immediate and long-term savings opportunities that are meaningful and sustainable. A team led by FES President Donny Schneider is working to identify savings and process improvements across the company with a particular emphasis on our generation business. The team is focused on expense reductions, capital expenditures and inventory. We're also working with an outside consultant to examine the significant savings potential in our supply chain. 
With more than $2.5 billion in annual spending in the project scope, we believe that significant cost savings opportunities are available while continuing to successfully serve the needs of our organization, customers and employees. I will note that workforce and benefit reductions are not included in the scope of the project. 
In all, we are targeting $50 million in savings this year and an additional $150 million in 2016, reaching a run rate of $200 million by 2017. We expect that the savings will be split about evenly between O&M expenses and capital expenditures and help us create sustainable levels for the future. By appropriately addressing our cost structure, we can help direct our future and move FirstEnergy to a point that our fundamental operations make the company stronger while improving the balance sheet over time. 
We're off to a solid start in 2015. Our early financial results, together with our progress on our strategic initiatives, are building a solid foundation for the year and for the future of our company. These results and our outlook for the remainder of the year continue to support 2015 operating guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Consistent with the leadership philosophy I've shared with many of you, I would like to narrow the gap between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. While some differences are expected, we are diligently focused on earnings quality. 
Now we will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our first quarter financial results, then we'll open the call to your questions."

Consistent with our approach in the last call, I will use my time today to speak to the major drivers and events of the first quarter.

Consistent with our approach in the last call, I will use my time today to speak to the major drivers and events of the first quarter. This information is detailed in our consolidated report which is posted to our website. And we would be happy to address any specific questions in the Q&A or after the call. 
As Chuck said, this morning, we reported strong 2015 first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share, which compares to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, basic and diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.53 per share compared to 2014 first quarter basic earnings of $0.50 per share or $0.49 per share on a diluted basis. 
We're off to a good start for the year. First quarter of 2015 operating earnings were fairly clean and simple. As expected, we benefited from improvements in our competitive business as well as increased transmission revenue which were partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in our corporate segment. 
From the standpoint of our first quarter guidance, we came in above the range we've provided largely due to the impact on our distribution business of extremely cold weather in late February and March. Compared to the normal weather that we include our guidance, first quarter wires revenue benefited by $0.06 per share as a result of heating-degree days that were 21% above normal during the period. This was offset by about $0.03 per share related to weather impacts at our competitive business. First quarter operating earnings also benefited by a net $0.03 per share compared to guidance, primarily as a result of the New Jersey storm amortization delay and incremental revenue from our TrAIL transmission investments. 
Overall, distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to last year, reflecting the weather as well as modest growth in our customer base, offset by the impact of lower average customer use associated with energy efficiency. 
Residential sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2014, but down 1.7% on a weather-adjusted basis, while or both actual and weather-adjusted commercial sales increased slightly. Industrial sales were also up slightly, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. 
While soft natural gas prices are deterring some new entrants into the shale gas fields, our conservative estimates continue to support more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from midstream businesses through 2019. The shale slowdown contributed to softer first quarter demand from the steel sector, however, most of the other key sectors in our region remained solid. 
In our transmission business, first quarter operating earnings were $0.17 per share, reflecting incremental rate-based growth at both ATSI and TrAIL and forward-looking rates at ATSI beginning January 1 this year, partially offset by higher depreciation, taxes and interest expense. As Chuck described, our competitive business was able to more effectively navigate this year's extreme weather conditions due to the changes we began putting in place during the second quarter of last year. 
Our 2015 first quarter operating results in this business reflect the benefits of this repositioning and improved plant availability as well as higher capacity revenues. For 2015, our committed sales currently are about 70 million megawatt-hours, essentially having sold everything we anticipated on a retail and forward-wholesale basis, with over 8 million megawatt-hours available for spot wholesale sales over the remainder of the year. 
For 2015, we are also reducing our generation production estimate from about 79 million megawatt-hours down to about 72 million megawatt-hours due to the economic and market conditions we experienced during the first quarter and a market price outlook for the balance of 2015. If it is more economic for us to purchase power from the market to serve load when needed, we will do so, but we have the benefit of our own generating resources if and when we need to call on them. Ultimately, market conditions will determine how much we generate from the fleet and how much we purchase. Essentially, we will source the power to meet our retail load obligations as economically as possible. For 2016, approximately 70% of our projected sales are committed. 
Based on our results for the first quarter, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million, as well as our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range of $750 million to $850 million. 
Consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year, the corporate consolidated effective tax rate was 38.8% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This change drove an $0.08 per share decrease in the corporate segment compared to last year and reflects the elimination of certain future tax liabilities associated with basis differences in the first quarter of 2014. 
This year is off to a solid start, and we are executing our plans to improve our company's fundamentals and drive long-term shareholder value through customer-focused regulated growth. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share and are also providing a second quarter operating earnings range of $0.42 to $0.50 per share. 
With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

We have some significant opportunity in the cash flow improvement project that Chuck talked about, and then a couple of the other big items that we're still looking at, the capacity performance and the PPA. We don't have any plans right now to term any of that debt out. We will continue to look at it. The first quarter's a little bit unusual from cash flow output. We generally prepay our Pennsylvania gross receipts tax, that's about $170-some million. We had a pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. Ohio property taxes are due in the first and third quarter. And generally, our benefit plan payouts are in the first quarter. So it's a bit of an abnormal. I would expect that over the rest of the year, we would not see that balance to grow. In fact, we may reduce that somewhat. But we will continue to look at whether it makes sense to terminate it out. I would prefer, as time goes on, to push that further down into the business units, have the debt closer to the asset. But I think we've got to wait to see where we come out on some of these initiatives before we make that final decision."

And I wanted to ask a question regarding that. One of the distinct aspects of your operating earnings presentation as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, is that unlike your GAAP earnings, where the difference between expected returns on pension assets and realized returns on pension assets is recognized every year in the fourth quarter. In operating earnings, there's actually no recognition of that difference. And I estimate that over the last 5 years, that difference of expected returns over actual returns on pension assets has been something like $570 million. This works out to an average of about $115 million a year or $0.27 a share. So I was -- my question then is, are you thinking in -- of ways in which you could perhaps reflect more accurately on operating earnings the outcome of your pension investments?"

And that is -- it was not our weather-related event even though the temperature outside might have been 17 below 0. The temperature inside that transformer is around 75 to 90 degrees C. So it was a random failure that just happened to occur at the worst time that it could possibly occur. So that was the biggest impact on 2014. Beyond that, we took some steps to harden, if you will, some of the equipment that is outdoors and subject to weather at our power plants that could lead to a disruption in unit performance. But there wasn't a whole lot of significant work and expenditures necessary to do that. And I will just tell you that the teamwork between our commodity group and our generation fleet was exceptional this winter. And that also led to the type of results that we were able to accomplish.

We had a good quarter and we're off to a great start for the year. Since our last call in February, we have continued our work to position FirstEnergy for solid, predictable and customer service driven regulated growth. 
This morning, we will talk about our progress on those strategies. We will also discuss other key initiatives, including an important effort that is underway to reduce our cost structure and drive improvements to our balance sheet. And of course, we will review our first quarter financial results and operational performance. 
Similar to our last call, we intend to keep these prepared remarks brief to allow ample time for your questions before the end of the hour. 
Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share are slightly above the top end of our guidance range and give us a solid foundation to start the year. We benefited from the growth in our Transmission business and solid distribution performance that was assisted by second year of unusually cold weather. Our year-over-year results also reflect the actions we began taking in the second quarter of 2014 to reposition the retail sales portfolio in our competitive business. 
For the past year, we have talked about the extreme weather events of 2014's first quarter and the impact those conditions had on our competitive business and our strategy. The first quarter of 2015 was even colder, with heating-degree days totaling 21% above normal and 2% higher than 2014. The PJM market also set a new winter peak of 144,000 megawatts, exceeding the previous winter peak which was set in January of 2014. 
In our competitive business, however, the difference in our results between this winter and last is striking. This improvement speaks to the benefit of our more conservative strategy, which includes 3 major components. First, selling no more than we produce in order to maintain an open position of at least 10 million to 20 million megawatt-hours annually to protect against extreme weather, unplanned outages or a combination of both. As a result of our actions to strategically reduce load obligations, our 2015 retail and polar obligations are expected to be about 68 million megawatt-hours compared to 99 million megawatt-hours in 2014. 
Second, reducing exposure to weather-sensitive load. From January of 2014 through March of 2015, our overall retail obligations are down nearly 35% on an annualized basis, with much of that coming from serving fewer of the most weather-sensitive residential and small commercial customers. 
And finally, a more rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. This strategy, together with improved plant operations, helped to mitigate the potential downside from this year's severe first quarter weather and demand conditions even though our region experienced 4 more below 0 days this February than last January. 
As contracts continue to roll off, we expect a further decrease in our annualized retail load obligation through the end of this year, and much of that decline will be associated with the most weather-sensitive load. 
As I have mentioned to many of you previously, we recognize that reducing risk in the business also means that we're likely giving up some earnings potential. But as we have said, our objective is to make the competitive business more stable as we focus our efforts on growth in the regulated businesses. In that regard, the last few months have been a busy, busy period for our Energizing the Future transmission investment program. 
We are nearing completion of projects that are designed to maintain service reliability in the wake of plant deactivations in Northern Ohio. Those plants ceased operations for good on April 15. These projects included the Bruce Mansfield-Glenwillow project, a $195 million, 345 kilovolt transmission line extending 119 miles from Western Pennsylvania to Suburban Cleveland scheduled to go in service by June 1.
In addition, we are preparing to energize new 345-kilovolt substations and associated transmission upgrades in Wood, Trumbull and Stark counties, which are designed to maintain service rollout reliability in Northern Ohio after the plants are closed. We also continued our work to strengthen the grid to help protect it from storms and make network and physical security upgrades. 
Finally, we are on track with our planned investments on projects that will support the midstream gas operations with about $365 million in the pipeline through 2019.
On the regulatory front, our rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have concluded. In Pennsylvania, we were pleased that the PUC accepted our rate plan settlements for each of our 4 utilities in the state. The new rates, which will be effective on Sunday, will help our operating companies continue to enhance reliability and service to our Pennsylvania customers. We are looking at further options for customer-focused investments going forward, including the option to possibly request a distribution system improvement charge to recover the cost of those investments. 
In New Jersey, we received recovery of approximately $580 million in cost incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms, and we are glad to have the long process and uncertainty behind us. Now we look forward to working with the BPU as we set a course for our future infrastructure and reliability investments at JCP&L. 
We have had a good and productive start to the year and we are making solid progress toward our long-term goals. Looking forward, there are still 3 major initiatives underway that will ultimately help shape our company and our strategies going forward. 
First, in Ohio, the hearing on our electric security plan has been delayed by 60 days and is scheduled to begin on June 15. As you know, in its recent decisions on the AEP and Duke cases, the PUCO ruled that stability riders related to purchase power agreements similar to our proposal are legal in Ohio. This was an extremely significant outcome. We believe that our filing includes a robust case for how our proposal benefits utility customers and supports economic development in the state. On May 4, we expect to file supplemental testimony to further demonstrate how our plan meets the factors outlined in the AEP and Duke cases. 
While we are comfortable with the new schedule set by the PUCO, this schedule will affect the timing of our analyst meeting which we had hoped to have this summer. We believe that it makes sense to host this meeting after we receive a decision in Ohio, which pushes us to sometime late this year.
The second open matter that could have a significant impact on our business is the PJM capacity performance proposal. PJM has addressed FERC's questions into the structure of the product. Pending its final decision, FERC granted PJM's requested waiver to delay the May capacity auction to no later than the week of August 10. We appreciate the care and long-term perspective that FERC is taking in its review of this important mechanism and expect that both PJM and FERC are interested in reaching a resolution as soon as possible. In both of these matters, we look forward to a final outcome that produces better clarity for our company and produces benefits for electric consumers in our region. 
On a related item, as you know, we had delayed our decision to construct a new dewatering facility for our 2,400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield plant in Pennsylvania while we evaluated the plants future, particularly with respect to the results of the next capacity auction. We will continue to monitor market conditions, but given the current environment, including the auction delay, we think it makes sense to move forward with some early aspects of this project. This work is designed to preserve our ability to continue operations of the plant after December 31, 2016. All costs associated with this project are in our current business plan. 
We of course intend to remain sharply focused on those things we can control, including our own spending on goods and services, operating expenses and other corporate spending as well as capital expenditures. 
Last month, we launched a cash flow improvement project intending to capture both immediate and long-term savings opportunities that are meaningful and sustainable. A team led by FES President Donny Schneider is working to identify savings and process improvements across the company with a particular emphasis on our generation business. The team is focused on expense reductions, capital expenditures and inventory. We're also working with an outside consultant to examine the significant savings potential in our supply chain. 
With more than $2.5 billion in annual spending in the project scope, we believe that significant cost savings opportunities are available while continuing to successfully serve the needs of our organization, customers and employees. I will note that workforce and benefit reductions are not included in the scope of the project. 
In all, we are targeting $50 million in savings this year and an additional $150 million in 2016, reaching a run rate of $200 million by 2017. We expect that the savings will be split about evenly between O&M expenses and capital expenditures and help us create sustainable levels for the future. By appropriately addressing our cost structure, we can help direct our future and move FirstEnergy to a point that our fundamental operations make the company stronger while improving the balance sheet over time. 
We're off to a solid start in 2015. Our early financial results, together with our progress on our strategic initiatives, are building a solid foundation for the year and for the future of our company. These results and our outlook for the remainder of the year continue to support 2015 operating guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Consistent with the leadership philosophy I've shared with many of you, I would like to narrow the gap between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. While some differences are expected, we are diligently focused on earnings quality. 
Now we will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our first quarter financial results, then we'll open the call to your questions."

Consistent with our approach in the last call, I will use my time today to speak to the major drivers and events of the first quarter. This information is detailed in our consolidated report which is posted to our website. And we would be happy to address any specific questions in the Q&A or after the call. 
As Chuck said, this morning, we reported strong 2015 first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share, which compares to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, basic and diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.53 per share compared to 2014 first quarter basic earnings of $0.50 per share or $0.49 per share on a diluted basis. 
We're off to a good start for the year. First quarter of 2015 operating earnings were fairly clean and simple. As expected, we benefited from improvements in our competitive business as well as increased transmission revenue which were partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in our corporate segment. 
From the standpoint of our first quarter guidance, we came in above the range we've provided largely due to the impact on our distribution business of extremely cold weather in late February and March. Compared to the normal weather that we include in our guidance, first quarter wires revenue benefited by $0.06 per share as a result of heating-degree days that were 21% above normal during the period. This was offset by about $0.03 per share related to weather impacts at our competitive business. First quarter operating earnings also benefited by a net $0.03 per share compared to guidance, primarily as a result of the New Jersey storm amortization delay and incremental revenue from our TrAIL transmission investments. 
Overall, distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to last year, reflecting the weather as well as modest growth in our customer base, offset by the impact of lower average customer use associated with energy efficiency. 
Residential sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2014, but down 1.7% on a weather-adjusted basis, while both actual and weather-adjusted commercial sales increased slightly. Industrial sales were also up slightly, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. 
While soft natural gas prices are deterring some new entrants into the shale gas fields, our conservative estimates continue to support more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from midstream businesses through 2019. The shale slowdown contributed to softer first quarter demand from the steel sector, however, most of the other key sectors in our region remained solid. 
In our transmission business, first quarter operating earnings were $0.17 per share, reflecting incremental rate-based growth at both ATSI and TrAIL and forward-looking rates at ATSI beginning January 1 this year, partially offset by higher depreciation, taxes and interest expense. As Chuck described, our competitive business was able to more effectively navigate this year's extreme weather conditions due to the changes we began putting in place during the second quarter of last year. 
Our 2015 first quarter operating results in this business reflect the benefits of this repositioning and improved plant availability as well as higher capacity revenues. For 2015, our committed sales currently are about 70 million megawatt-hours, essentially having sold everything we anticipated on a retail and forward-wholesale basis, with over 8 million megawatt-hours available for spot wholesale sales over the remainder of the year. 
For 2015, we are also reducing our generation production estimate from about 79 million megawatt-hours down to about 72 million megawatt-hours due to the economic and market conditions we experienced during the first quarter and a market price outlook for the balance of 2015. If it is more economic for us to purchase power from the market to serve load when needed, we will do so, but we have the benefit of our own generating resources if and when we need to call on them. Ultimately, market conditions will determine how much we generate from the fleet and how much we purchase. Essentially, we will source the power to meet our retail load obligations as economically as possible. For 2016, approximately 70% of our projected sales are committed. 
Based on our results for the first quarter, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million, as well as our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range of $750 million to $850 million. 
Consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year, the corporate consolidated effective tax rate was 38.8% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This change drove an $0.08 per share decrease in the corporate segment compared to last year and reflects the elimination of certain future tax liabilities associated with basis differences in the first quarter of 2014. 
This year is off to a solid start, and we are executing our plans to improve our company's fundamentals and drive long-term shareholder value through customer-focused regulated growth. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share and are also providing a second quarter operating earnings range of $0.42 to $0.50 per share. 
With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And I think that we were able to capitalize on some of that weather improvement that we get on the utility side by doing what I said, and that is operating our generating business much more conservatively. And part of that is we're not going to dispatch units into a price that they don't make money if we can avoid doing that. So Donny, you want to fill in any details? Or."

And that is -- it was not a weather-related event even though the temperature outside might have been 17 below 0. The temperature inside that transformer is around 75 to 90 degrees C. So it was a random failure that just happened to occur at the worst time that it could possibly occur. So that was the biggest impact on 2014. Beyond that, we took some steps to harden, if you will, some of the equipment that is outdoors and subject to weather at our power plants that could lead to a disruption in unit performance. But there wasn't a whole lot of significant work and expenditures necessary to do that. And I will just tell you that the teamwork between our commodity group and our generation fleet was exceptional this winter. And that also led to the type of results that we were able to accomplish.
Okay, well, I think that was the last question. 
So we want to thank you, all, for your support. Obviously, I think we had a pretty good quarter. It was influenced by the weather and I'm not going to take credit for the weather because we've got July and August coming and if that goes the other way, I'm not going to take blame for the weather either. But it was a good start to the year. If you dig down below that, our operational performance was right on schedule with what we're trying to accomplish. And I know one quarter doesn't make a trend, but you have to start with 1 before you can get to 10 or 12. So that's our game plan and we thank you, all, for your support."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share an update on what has been a very busy and productive period for FirstEnergy. We are continuing to make steady progress on our strategic initiatives. We're achieving closure on several of the industry issues that impact our company, and we reported very strong financial results for the second quarter. Our efforts to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-driven growth remain on track, and I'm optimistic about our future. 
During my remarks today, I will review a number of recent developments and give you a sense of what we are expecting for the rest of the year. Following my comments and Jim's review of our financial and operating results, we'll have plenty of time for your questions. 
Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.53 per share, which is $0.03 above the top of the range we provided in May. These results were higher -- these results were driven by higher earnings in our transmission business and the benefits of our more conservative strategy in a competitive business. We continue to make solid progress on our Energizing the Future transmission initiatives, which as you know is expected to be the primary driver of our growth for the next several years. 
During the second quarter, we completed the project designed to support service reliability following the plant deactivations in Northern Ohio, and we continue our work to upgrade and strengthen the grid in the ATSI region and support midstream gas operations. We remain on pace to invest $970 million in our transmission business during 2015 with about 60% of this investment already complete. This year, we have also put into place the framework to ensure more timely recovery for our transmission investments. In January, we moved to a forward-looking formula rate structure for ATSI and on July 20, we filed with FERC a settlement agreement that maintains ATSI's ROE at 12.38% for the first 6 months of this year. Under the settlement, which remains subject to FERC approval, the rate adjust to 11.06% for the second half of this year and into 10.3% beginning January 1, 2016 until at least January 1, 2018. The average ROE for the 3-year period would be 10.83%. We are pleased to reach the settlement as it reflects to current transmission ROE environment and allows us to move forward with our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan for customers while ensuring timely recovery for the company. We expect approval from for later this year. In June, we filed request for authorization to transfer transmission assets owned by Penelec and JCP&L into a new transmission affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. These assets represent approximately $900 million in rate base as of the end of 2014. If approved by FERC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, MAIT will operate similarly to our 2 new transmission subsidiaries, ATSI and TrAILCo. We expect the structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for customers of our Eastern utility companies, similar to what we are doing for customers connected to our ATSI transmission system. We are seeking approval from FERC in 6 months and from the state commissions by mid-2016. Prior to closing the transaction, MAIT will file for new transmission rates with FERC. In May, I outlined 3 key initiatives that will shape our company going forward. These are the cash flow improvement project, PJM, capacity market reforms and our Ohio ESP. 
Let's start with the results from our cash flow improvement project. I'm pleased to report that we expect this project resulted cash flow improvements of $58 million in 2015, $155 million in 2016 and $240 million in 2017, exceeding the original targets for all 3 years. We launched this project in April with the goal of capturing both immediate and long-term savings that are meaningful and sustainable. We have completed a thorough analysis of savings and process improvements that do not compromise our ability to serve the needs of our organization, our customers and our employees. And we are now moving forward to implement these plans. These improvements come primarily from our competitive and corporate functions. The largest categories include reducing expenses and capital at our competitive fleet, particularly in our subcritical fossil units, reducing fossil fuel and fuel-related commodity expenses and taking advantage of attrition across the company and implementing a selective hiring program. There are also nearly 100 smaller items that collectively make a strong impact. About 65% of these savings are expected from operating expenses and 35% are from capital and nuclear fuel improvements over the 3-year period. 
On Page 170 of our FactBook, which was posted on our website last evening, we include more details on the cash flow initiative. We've already begun the implementation process. In fact, the majority of the fuel savings that we identified have already been locked in, and the new contract pricing will begin in September. We've also established a project management office to ensure we capture these savings and are fully committed to successfully executing this plan and establishing a new foundation for FirstEnergy going forward. We believe it will result in a stronger and more flexible company with improved balance sheet over time. 
Turning the capacity market reforms. During the quarter, FERC approved PJM's new capacity performance roles and as you know, FERC issued an order last week allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources into the transitional options. Importantly, the base residual auction remains on track and is still scheduled to begin August 10. The 2016, '17 and 2017, '18 were delayed slightly and are now scheduled to begin on August 26 and September 3 respectively. Before I move from generation, let's quickly touch on the Supreme Court decision regarding MATS. While the EPA regulations remain in effect pending further judicial proceedings before the DC Circuit Court, I want to be clear that FirstEnergy is not contemplating reopening any of the units representing 4,769 megawatts of generation that were closed due to cost of compliance with the MATS regulations. For our remaining fleet, we have already spent a significant portion of the $370 million in capital expenditures for equipment upgrades that were acquired under MATS, and many projects are complete or underway. In our competitive generation fleet, we identified a total cost of $178 million to comply with the regulations, of which $62 million had been spent through June 30 this year. At our regulated fleet, the cost estimate was $192 million with $105 million of that spent through June 30. 
I will also mention that we are moving forward all aspects of the construction of the new dewatering facility for our 2400-megawatt Bruce Mansfield Plant in Pennsylvania. While the plant is still pressured by current market conditions, we believe moving forward with construction is prudent to ensure that these megawatts remain available to serve customers in 2017 after our disposal rates that will then expire. As we have previously mentioned, all costs associated with this project are in our current capital plan. 
Finally, let's move to our Ohio and our electric security plan. Based on the current procedural schedules, staff testimony is due August 14 with hearings to begin at the end of the month. As you would expect, we remain very engaged in this process. We filed supplemental testimony in early May to further emphasize the factors that the Ohio Commission outlined in the ADP and Duke induced. It is telling that the public utilities that serve the majority of customers in the state agree conceptually on an appropriate transition plan toward a future that ensures safe, reliable, clean and affordable power for all Ohio customers from industrial facilities to homeowners. Given the plant's benefits including economic development support, we believe our filing meets the criteria outlined by the commission, and we remain optimistic that this plan will result in sound state energy policy for our customers. 
We had a solid first half. Since the start of the year, we made tremendous progress toward our goals of investing in customer-focused growth, supporting sound energy policy and strengthening our company from within, and we know there is still work to be done to position FirstEnergy for the future. At this point, we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 a share to $2.70 a share, with all 3 of our operating segments trending favorably versus their mid-points. We're comfortable guiding to the top of this range. We expect to refine guidance in the third quarter call once we have seen the full effects of the summer weather. Collectively, the cash flow improvement initiatives, upcoming capacity auction results and Ohio ESP decision will drive the near-term financial strategy of our company and give us a much clearer view of the next 3 years, including earnings and cash flow and a determination on additional equity, if any, to drive growth in our regulated businesses. In addition, we have already begun our robust annual planning process, which includes updating projections for all of our utilities, especially now that we have the 3 major rate cases behind us. This effort will help us further refine our distribution utility earnings profile going forward. Many of you have asked about the status of our analyst meeting. At this time, we still intend to hold it after the outcome of the Ohio ESP, which may push the meeting into early 2016. We look forward to providing you a comprehensive view of our future planning at that time. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our second quarter financial results."

And as always, w",564,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events of the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions either in the Q&A or following the call. Today, we reported strong second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.53 per share, which compares to $0.49 per share last year. On a GAAP basis, basic earnings were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP earnings were $0.16 per basic share during the same period last year. As Chuck mentioned, our operating earnings were above our targeted range for the quarter. 
Let's look at the results from each of our segments, starting with the distribution business. Residential sales decreased 0.7% overall compared to the second quarter of 2014, while commercial sales increased 1%. Adjusting for weather, residential deliveries were down 2.4%, and commercial sales were flat. We are examining the residential usage trend, which has been down over the last 4 quarters on a weather-adjusted basis. We believe this is attributable to energy efficiency as average customer usage has also declined quarter-over-quarter. In the industrial sector, sales decreased 1.1% in the quarter, ending a 7-quarter run of increased demand from the customer class, primarily due to lower usage from the steel industry. The current rate of shale growth continues to be impacted by soft natural gas prices. While we still see support from more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from midstream activity through 2019, our forecast reflects greater confidence in the 2015 and 2016 projects, which represents about half of that load growth. 
Turning to our transmission business. Second quarter operating earnings increased $0.06 to $0.21 per share as a result of revenue increases from higher rate base and ATSI and the forward-looking rate structure that began in January. In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.01 per share compared to the same period last year, reflecting higher commodity margin associated with high-capacity revenues, a modest increase in wholesale sales and lower contract sales. Additionally, operating cost decreased year-over-year largely due to improved plant performance. As we said last quarter, we have essentially sold everything we anticipated for 2015 on a retail and forward wholesale basis, with a reserve of 5 million-megawatt hours available for spot wholesale sales through the end of the year. For 2016, about 70% of our expected generation resources are committed, and we are currently about 40% committed for 2017. Based on our results for the first half of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement initiative, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to $825 million to $925 million from $750 million to $850 million. It was another solid quarter for our company, and this is shaping up to be a good year. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance, and the trends we see so far this year make us confident at the top end of that range at this point. We are committed to achieving the cash savings we have identified and to building long-term shareholder value through our customer-focused regulated growth strategy. Now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

So when you take a look at the V6 savings, as you noted, Dan, one of the most significant savings and initiative comes from the reduction in the fossil fuel cost. And that total savings is about $151 million. It kind of breaks out as follows: about half or $75 million of the savings is really a result of working with our coal suppliers to reduce rates. And then we got about $50 million associated with our refined coal process where we partnered with several third parties to produce a coal that reduces emissions. We have a contractual relationship where we pay for every ton [ph] of coal that's treated, and the third party receives a tax credit under Section 45 of the tax code. These projects are now in place at Mansfield through 2021, and we're in the final steps of negotiating for presence. The balance, which is about $25 million is driven from several smaller items including reagent and waste disposal cost that as Chuck said, these already under contract. So that's part of the breakdown of the savings and clearly, the coal suppliers are in tight market times as well as we are. We found opportunities to build on our relationships. We've got good relationships with the coal suppliers and the transportation suppliers. We meet with them twice a year to work through these market challenges. We try to find ways we can partner in a win-win kind of an approach. So we have -- we've been successful so far. We look forward to working with them in the future."

There is a shortage of transmission alignment around the country, and that would be a factor in terms of expanding it to any significant amount, I think."

In the interview, I was asked specific question of are we in anyway, working to get the legislature of the state to consider re-regulating, and my answer was no. In the context of the discussion about the PPAs, here's my view. We are talking about trying to find ways to preserve major generating assets that have plenty of useful life left in them and keep them from closing prematurely. Exelon is looking at doing do that in Illinois and New York. Ohio utilities are looking at doing it in Ohio. You don't ever hear any conversation about needing to do that in states that are regulated. Regulated states have plenty of generation. Then have integrated resource plans. And if they need more generation, they either buy or build it, so they are assured they have adequate generation to serve their customers. So these PPAs, I see, as a bridge to keep these plants alive long enough to allow whatever happens. If our state wants to look at that issue over time, great. But it's not that happen fast enough for these 2 plants. If we are ultimately able to make significant corrections in the market to make sure they provide for the long-term security of baseload-generating facilities, great. But I don't think we have time to wait on that either. And yesterday, the Senate Energy Committee put forth a bill that talks about asking the markets to kind of come up with a process to make sure they ensure diversity of both fuel and types of capacity across the markets. We don't have to wait on that either. These plans are at risk today, and we need to get a decision made as to whether we're going to look at ways to protect him so we left all of those debates and legislation in Washington, D.C. and everything else play out."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share an update on what has been a very busy and productive period for FirstEnergy. We're continuing to make steady progress on our strategic initiatives. We're achieving closure on several of the industry issues that impact our company, and we reported very strong financial results for the second quarter. Our efforts to position FirstEnergy for a stable, predictable and customer service-driven growth remain on track, and I'm optimistic about our future. 
During my remarks today, I will review a number of recent developments and give you a sense of what we expect for the rest of the year. Following my comments and Jim's review of our financial and operating results, we'll have plenty of time for your questions. 
Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.53 per share, which is $0.03 above the top of the range we provided in May. These results were higher -- these results were driven by higher earnings in our transmission business and the benefits of our more conservative strategy in our competitive business. We continue to make solid progress on our Energizing the Future transmission initiative, which as you know is expected to be the primary driver of our growth for the next several years. 
During the second quarter, we completed the project designed to support service reliability following the plant deactivations in Northern Ohio, and we continue our work to upgrade and strengthen the grid in the ATSI region and support midstream gas operations. We remain on pace to invest $970 million in our transmission business during 2015 with about 60% of this investment already complete. 
This year, we have also put into place the framework to ensure more timely recovery for our transmission investments. In January, we moved to a forward-looking formula rate structure for ATSI; and on July 20, we filed with FERC a settlement agreement that maintains ATSI's ROE at 12.38% for the first 6 months of this year. Under the settlement, which remains subject to FERC approval, the rate adjust to 11.06% for the second half of this year and then to 10.38% beginning January 1, 2016 until at least January 1, 2018. The average ROE for the 3-year period would be 10.83%. We are pleased to reach the settlement as it reflects to current transmission ROE environment and allows us to move forward with our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan for customers while ensuring timely recovery for the company. We expect approval from FERC later this year. 
In June, we filed request for authorization to transfer transmission assets owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L into a new transmission affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. These assets represent approximately $900 million in rate base as of the end of 2014. If approved by FERC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, MAIT will operate similarly to our 2 existing transmission subsidiaries, ATSI and TrAILCo. We expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for customers of our Eastern utility companies similar to what we are doing for customers connected to our ANSI -- ATSI transmission system. We are seeking approval from FERC in 6 months and from the state commissions by mid-2016. Prior to closing the transaction, MAIT will file for new transmission rates with FERC. 
In May, I outlined 3 key initiatives that will shape our company going forward. These are the cash flow improvement project, PJM capacity market reforms and our Ohio ESP. 
Let's start with the results of our cash flow improvement project. I'm pleased to report that we expect this project to result in cash flow improvements of $58 million in 2015, $155 million in 2016 and $240 million in 2017, exceeding the original targets for all 3 years. We launched this project in April with the goal of capturing both immediate and long-term savings that are meaningful and sustainable. We have completed a thorough analysis of savings and process improvements that do not compromise our ability to serve the needs of our organization, our customers and our employees. And we are now moving forward to implement these plans. These improvements come primarily from our competitive and corporate functions. The largest categories include: reducing expenses and capital at our competitive fleet, particularly at our subcritical fossil units; reducing fossil fuel and fuel-related commodity expenses; and taking advantage of attrition across the company and implementing a selective hiring program. There are also nearly 100 smaller items that collectively make a strong impact. About 65% of these savings are expected from operating expenses and 35% are from capital and nuclear fuel improvements over the 3-year period. 
On Page 170 of our FactBook, which was posted on our website last evening, we include more details on the cash flow initiative. 
We've already begun the implementation process. In fact, the majority of the fuel savings that we identified have already been locked in, and the new contract pricing will begin in September. We've also established a project management office to ensure we capture these savings and are fully committed to successfully executing this plan and establishing a new foundation for FirstEnergy going forward. We believe it will result in a stronger and more flexible company with an improved balance sheet over time. 
Turning to capacity market reforms. During the quarter, FERC approved PJM's new capacity performance roles, and as you know, FERC issued an order last week allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources into the transitional options. Importantly, the base residual auction remains on track and is still scheduled to begin August 10. The 2016- '17 and 2017- '18 transitional auctions were delayed slightly and are now scheduled to begin on August 26 and September 3, respectively. 
Before I move from generation, let's quickly touch on the Supreme Court decision regarding MATS. While the EPA regulations remain in effect pending further judicial proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court, I want to be clear that FirstEnergy is not contemplating reopening any of the units representing 4,769 megawatts of generation that were closed due to cost of compliance with the MATS regulation. For our remaining fleet, we have already spent a significant portion of the $370 million in capital expenditures for equipment upgrades that were acquired under MATS, and many projects are complete or underway. In our competitive generation fleet, we identified a total cost of $178 million to comply with the regulations, of which $62 million had been spent through June 30 this year. At our regulated fleet, the cost estimate was $192 million with $105 million of that spent through June 30. 
I will also mention that we are moving forward with all aspects of the construction of the new dewatering facility for our 2,400-megawatt Bruce Mansfield Plant in Pennsylvania. While the plant is still pressured by current market conditions, we believe moving forward with construction is prudent to ensure that these megawatts remain available to serve customers in 2017 after our disposal rates at Little Blue Run expire. As we have previously mentioned, all costs associated with this project are in our current capital plan. 
Finally, let's move to our Ohio and our electric security plan. Based on the current procedural schedules, staff testimony is due August 14 with hearings to begin at the end of the month. As you would expect, we remain very engaged in this process. We filed supplemental testimony in early May to further emphasize the factors that the Ohio Commission outlined in the ADP and Duke cases. It is telling that the public utilities that serve the majority of customers in the state agree conceptually on an appropriate transition plan toward a future that ensures safe, reliable, clean and affordable power for all Ohio customers from industrial facilities to homeowners. Given the plant's benefits, including the economic development support, we believe our filing meets the criteria outlined by the commission, and we remain optimistic that this plan will result in sound state energy policy for our customers. 
We had a solid first half. Since the start of the year, we have made tremendous progress toward our goals of investing in customer-focused growth supporting sound energy policy and strengthening our company from within, and we know there is still work to be done to position FirstEnergy for the future. 
At this point, we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 a share to $2.70 a share with all 3 of our operating segments trending favorably versus their midpoints. We're comfortable guiding to the top of this range. We expect to refine guidance on the third quarter call once we have seen the full effects of the summer weather. 
Collectively, the cash flow improvement initiative, upcoming capacity auction results and Ohio ESP decision will drive the near-term financial strategy of our company and give us a much clearer view of the next 3 years, including earnings and cash flow and a determination on additional equity, if any, to drive growth in our regulated businesses. 
In addition, we have already begun our robust annual planning process, which includes updating projections for all of our utilities, especially now that we have the 3 major rate cases behind us. This effort will help us further refine our distribution utility earnings profile going forward. 
Many of you have asked about the status of our Analyst Meeting. At this time, we still intend to hold it after the outcome of the Ohio ESP, which may push the meeting into early 2016. We look forward to providing you a comprehensive view of our future planning at that time. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our second quarter financial results."

My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events of the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted on our website yesterday evening, and as always, w",566,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events of the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted on our website yesterday evening, and as always, we welcome your questions either in the Q&A or following the call. 
Today, we reported strong second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.53 per share, which compares to $0.49 per share last year. On a GAAP basis, basic earnings were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP earnings were $0.16 per basic share during the same period last year. As Chuck mentioned, our operating earnings were above our targeted range for the quarter. 
Let's look at the results from each of our segments starting with the distribution business. Residential sales decreased 0.7% overall compared to the second quarter of 2014 while commercial sales increased 1%. Adjusting for weather, residential deliveries were down 2.4%, and commercial sales were flat. We are examining the residential usage trend, which has been down over the last 4 quarters on a weather-adjusted basis. We believe this is attributable to energy efficiency as average customer usage has also declined quarter-over-quarter. 
In the industrial sector, sales decreased 1.1% in the quarter ending a 7-quarter run of increased demand from the customer class primarily due to lower usage from the steel industry. 
The current rate of shale growth continues to be impacted by soft natural gas prices. While we still see support from more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from midstream activity through 2019, our forecast reflect greater confidence in the 2015 and 2016 projects, which represent about half of that load growth. 
Turning to our transmission business. Second quarter operating earnings increased $0.06 to $0.21 per share as a result of revenue increases from a higher rate base at ATSI and the forward-looking rate structure that began in January. 
In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.01 per share compared to the same period last year reflecting higher commodity margin associated with higher-capacity revenues, a modest increase in wholesale sales and lower contract sales. Additionally, operating cost decreased year-over-year largely due to improved plant performance. 
As we said last quarter, we have essentially sold everything we anticipated for 2015 on a retail and forward wholesale basis with a reserve of 5 million-megawatt hours available for spot wholesale sales through the end of the year. For 2016, about 70% of our expected generation resources are committed, and we are currently about 40% committed for 2017. 
Based on our results for the first half of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement initiative, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to $825 million to $925 million from $750 million to $850 million. 
It was another solid quarter for our company, and this is shaping up to be a good year. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance, and the trends we see so far this year make us confident at the top end of that range at this point. We are committed to achieving the cash savings we have identified and to building long-term shareholder value through our customer-focused regulated growth strategy. 
Now with that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And so when you take a look at the CFIP savings, as you noted, Dan, one of the most significant savings, and the initiative comes from the reduction in the fossil fuel cost. And that total savings is about $151 million. It kind of breaks out as follows: about $50 million or $75 million of the savings is really a result of working with our coal suppliers to get reduced rates, and then we got about $50 million associated with the refined coal process where we partnered with several third parties to produce a coal that reduces emissions. We have a contractual relationship where we pay for every ton of coal that's treated, and the third party receives a tax credit under Section 45 of the tax code. These contracts are now in place at Sammis and Mansfield through 2021, and we're in the final steps of negotiating for Pleasants. The balance, which is about $25 million, is driven from several smaller items including reagent and waste disposal cost. And as Chuck said, these are already under contract. So that's part of the breakdown of the savings, and clearly, the coal suppliers are in tight market times as well as we are. We found opportunities to build on our relationships. We've got good relationships with our coal suppliers and our transportation suppliers. We meet with them twice a year to work through these market challenges and try to find ways that we can partner in a win-win kind of an approach, so we have -- we've been successful so far. We look forward to working with them in the future."

So there's not a lot of additional delays that could be tolerated within the schedule we need to meet, so I think we are in a good place right now with regard to the timing of it, with hearings starting August 31. One thing I'd like to point out, it was after the last call that we continue to be in negotiations.

So I think we're going to be fine there for the foreseeable future. We already had that business in a position where it was cash flow positive for the next 4 years. This makes it substantially more cash flow positive, which was the second factor in the decision to go forward with demand still dewatering. All the CapEx for that project was already in the 4-year plan and already in a plan that was cash flow positive, but we've now got some margin there. And as I've said along, the game plan with that business is to keep it cash flow positive, cash -- and take that positive cash flow, and eventually, use it to start paying back the holding company for some of the loans that we made to that business a few years ago.

We went and met with the editorial board, and we had what I thought was a good conversation over 1 hour and 50 minutes that then gets boiled down into an article. Once that article's written, then there's a headline writer who goes and writes a headline that try to draw attention to that article. The headline that was written for that article was completely inaccurate as to anything we discussed during that interview. In the interview, I was asked a specific question of: are we, in anyway, working to get the legislature of the state to consider reregulating. And my answer was no. In the context of the discussion about the PPAs, here's my view. We are talking about trying to find ways to preserve major generating assets that have plenty of useful life left in them and keep them from closing prematurely. Exelon is looking at doing do that in Illinois and New York. Ohio utilities are looking at doing it in Ohio. You don't ever hear any conversation about needing to do that in states that are regulated. Regulated states have plenty of generation. They have integrated resource plans. And if they need more generation, they either buy or build it, so they are assured they have adequate generation to serve their customers. So these PPAs, I see as a bridge to keep these plants alive long enough to allow whatever happens. If our state wants to look at that issue over time, great. But it's not going to happen fast enough for these 2 plants. If we are ultimately able to make significant corrections in the market to make sure they provide for the long-term security of baseload-generating facilities, great. But I don't think we have time to wait on that either. And yesterday, the Senate Energy Committee put forth a bill that talks about asking the markets to kind of come up with a process to make sure they ensure diversity of both fuel and types of capacity -- generating capacity across the markets. We don't have to wait on that either. These plants are at risk today, and we need to get a decision made as to whether we're going to look at ways to protect them. So we let all of those debates and legislation in Washington, D.C. and everything else play out."

The midpoint of our original guidance was $2.55. That means we got $1.40 that we've got to capture the second half of the year just to get the midpoint. And $1.55, we've got to capture to get to the high end of the range. And we've got a lot of very volatile weather months in the third quarter, and a big third quarter.

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share an update on what has been a very busy and productive period for FirstEnergy. We're continuing to make steady progress on our strategic initiatives. We're achieving closure on several of the industry issues that impact our company, and we reported very strong financial results for the second quarter. Our efforts to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-driven growth remain on track, and I'm optimistic about our future. 
During my remarks today, I will review a number of recent developments and give you a sense of what we expect for the rest of the year. Following my comments and Jim's review of our financial and operating results, we'll have plenty of time for your questions. 
Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.53 per share, which is $0.03 above the top of the range we provided in May. These results were higher -- these results were driven by higher earnings in our transmission business and the benefits of our more conservative strategy in our competitive business. We continue to make solid progress on our Energizing the Future transmission initiative, which as you know is expected to be the primary driver of our growth for the next several years. 
During the second quarter, we completed the projects designed to support service reliability following the plant deactivations in Northern Ohio, and we continue our work to upgrade and strengthen the grid in the ATSI region and support midstream gas operations. We remain on pace to invest $970 million in our transmission business during 2015, with about 60% of this investment already complete. 
This year, we have also put into place the framework to ensure more timely recovery for our transmission investments. In January, we moved to a forward-looking formula rate structure for ATSI; and on July 20, we filed with FERC a settlement agreement that maintains ATSI's ROE at 12.38% for the first 6 months of this year. Under the settlement, which remains subject to FERC approval, the rate adjusts to 11.06% for the second half of this year and then to 10.38% beginning January 1, 2016 until at least January 1, 2018. The average ROE for the 3-year period would be 10.83%. We are pleased to reach the settlement, as it reflects the current transmission ROE environment and allows us to move forward with our Energizing the Future transmission investment plan for customers while ensuring timely recovery for the company. We expect approval from FERC later this year. 
In June, we filed requests for authorization to transfer transmission assets owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L into a new transmission affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. These assets represent approximately $900 million in rate base as of the end of 2014. If approved by FERC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, MAIT will operate similarly to our 2 existing transmission subsidiaries, ATSI and TrAILCo. We expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for customers of our Eastern utility companies similar to what we are doing for customers connected to our ANSI -- ATSI transmission system. We are seeking approval from FERC in 6 months and from the state commissions by mid-2016. Prior to closing the transaction, MAIT will file for new transmission rates with FERC. 
In May, I outlined 3 key initiatives that will shape our company going forward. These are the cash flow improvement project, PJM capacity market reforms and our Ohio ESP. 
Let's start with the results of our cash flow improvement project. I'm pleased to report that we expect this project to result in cash flow improvements of $58 million in 2015, $155 million in 2016 and $240 million in 2017, exceeding the original targets for all 3 years. We launched this project in April with the goal of capturing both immediate and long-term savings that are meaningful and sustainable. We have completed a thorough analysis of savings and process improvements that do not compromise our ability to serve the needs of our organization, our customers and our employees. And we are now moving forward to implement these plans. These improvements come primarily from our competitive and corporate functions. The largest categories include: reducing expenses and capital at our competitive fleet, particularly at our subcritical fossil units; reducing fossil fuel and fuel-related commodity expenses; and taking advantage of attrition across the company and implementing a selective hiring program. There are also nearly 100 smaller items that collectively make a strong impact. About 65% of these savings are expected from operating expenses and 35% are from capital and nuclear fuel improvements over the 3-year period. 
On Page 170 of our FactBook, which was posted on our website last evening, we include more details on the cash flow initiative. 
We've already begun the implementation process. In fact, the majority of the fuel savings that we identified have already been locked in, and the new contract pricing will begin in September. We've also established a project management office to ensure we capture these savings, and are fully committed to successfully executing this plan and establishing a new foundation for FirstEnergy going forward. We believe it will result in a stronger and more flexible company with an improved balance sheet over time. 
Turning to capacity market reforms. During the quarter, FERC approved PJM's new capacity performance rules, and as you know, FERC issued an order last week allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources into the transitional auctions. Importantly, the base residual auction remains on track and is still scheduled to begin August 10. The 2016-'17 and 2017-'18 transitional auctions were delayed slightly and are now scheduled to begin on August 26 and September 3, respectively. 
Before I move from generation, let's quickly touch on the Supreme Court decision regarding MATS. While the EPA regulations remain in effect pending further judicial proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court, I want to be clear that FirstEnergy is not contemplating reopening any of the units representing 4,769 megawatts of generation that were closed due to cost of compliance with the MATS regulation. For our remaining fleet, we have already spent a significant portion of the $370 million in capital expenditures for equipment upgrades that were required under MATS, and many projects are complete or underway. In our competitive generation fleet, we identified a total cost of $178 million to comply with the regulations, of which $62 million had been spent through June 30 of this year. At our regulated fleet, the cost estimate was $192 million, with $105 million of that spent through June 30. 
I will also mention that we are moving forward with all aspects of the construction of the new dewatering facility for our 2,400-megawatt Bruce Mansfield Plant in Pennsylvania. While the plant is still pressured by current market conditions, we believe moving forward with construction is prudent to ensure that these megawatts remain available to serve customers in 2017, after our disposal rights at Little Blue Run expire. As we have previously mentioned, all costs associated with this project are in our current capital plan. 
Finally, let's move to our Ohio and our electric security plan. Based on the current procedural schedules, staff testimony is due August 14, with hearings to begin at the end of the month. As you would expect, we remain very engaged in this process. We filed supplemental testimony in early May to further emphasize the factors that the Ohio Commission outlined in the AEP and Duke cases. It is telling that the public utilities that serve the majority of customers in the state agree conceptually on an appropriate transition plan toward a future that ensures safe, reliable, clean and affordable power for all Ohio customers, from industrial facilities to homeowners. Given the plan's benefits, including the economic development support, we believe our filing meets the criteria outlined by the commission, and we remain optimistic that this plan will result in sound state energy policy for our customers. 
We had a solid first half. Since the start of the year, we have made tremendous progress toward our goals of investing in customer-focused growth, supporting sound energy policy and strengthening our company from within, and we know there is still work to be done to position FirstEnergy for the future. 
At this point, we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 a share to $2.70 a share, with all 3 of our operating segments trending favorably versus their midpoints. We're comfortable guiding to the top of this range. We expect to refine guidance on the third quarter call, once we have seen the full effects of the summer weather. 
Collectively, the cash flow improvement initiative, upcoming capacity auction results and Ohio ESP decision will drive the near-term financial strategy of our company and give us a much clearer view of the next 3 years, including earnings and cash flow and a determination on additional equity, if any, to drive growth in our regulated businesses. 
In addition, we have already begun our robust annual planning process, which includes updating projections for all of our utilities, especially now that we have the 3 major rate cases behind us. This effort will help us further refine our distribution utility earnings profile going forward. 
Many of you have asked about the status of our Analyst Meeting. At this time, we still intend to hold it after the outcome of the Ohio ESP, which may push the meeting into early 2016. We look forward to providing you a comprehensive view of our future planning at that time. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our second quarter financial results."

My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events of the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted on our website yesterday evening, and as always, we welcome your questions either in the Q&A or following the call. 
Today, we reported strong second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.53 per share, which compares to $0.49 per share last year. On a GAAP basis, basic earnings were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP earnings were $0.16 per basic share during the same period last year. As Chuck mentioned, our operating earnings were above our targeted range for the quarter. 
Let's look at the results from each of our segments, starting with the distribution business. Residential sales decreased 0.7% overall compared to the second quarter of 2014 while commercial sales increased 1%. Adjusting for weather, residential deliveries were down 2.4% and commercial sales were flat. We are examining the residential usage trend, which has been down over the last 4 quarters on a weather-adjusted basis. We believe this is attributable to energy efficiency, as average customer usage has also declined quarter-over-quarter. 
In the industrial sector, sales decreased 1.1% in the quarter, ending a 7-quarter run of increased demand from the customer class, primarily due to lower usage from the steel industry. 
The current rate of shale growth continues to be impacted by soft natural gas prices. While we still see support for more than 1,000 megawatts of new load from midstream activity through 2019, our forecasts reflect greater confidence in the 2015 and 2016 projects, which represent about half of that load growth. 
Turning to our transmission business. Second quarter operating earnings increased $0.06 to $0.21 per share as a result of revenue increases from a higher rate base at ATSI and the forward-looking rate structure that began in January. 
In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.01 per share compared to the same period last year, reflecting higher commodity margin associated with higher capacity revenues, a modest increase in wholesale sales and lower contract sales. Additionally, operating costs decreased year-over-year, largely due to improved plant performance. 
As we said last quarter, we have essentially sold everything we anticipated for 2015 on a retail and forward wholesale basis, with a reserve of 5 million-megawatt hours available for spot wholesale sales through the end of the year. For 2016, about 70% of our expected generation resources are committed, and we are currently about 40% committed for 2017. 
Based on our results for the first half of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement initiative, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million, and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to $825 million to $925 million from $750 million to $850 million. 
It was another solid quarter for our company, and this is shaping up to be a good year. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance, and the trends we see so far this year make us confident at the top end of that range at this point. We are committed to achieving the cash savings we have identified and to building long-term shareholder value through our customer-focused regulated growth strategy. 
Now with that, I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And so when you take a look at the CFIP savings, as you noted, Dan, one of the most significant savings in the initiative comes from the reduction in the fossil fuel cost. And that total savings is about $151 million. It kind of breaks out as follows: about 1/2 or $75 million of the savings is really a result of working with our coal suppliers to get reduced rates, and then we got about $50 million associated with the refined coal process, where we partnered with several third parties to produce a coal that reduces emissions. We have a contractual relationship where we're paid for every ton of coal that's treated, and the third party receives a tax credit under Section 45 of the tax code. These contracts are now in place at Sammis and Mansfield through 2021, and we're in the final steps of negotiating for Pleasants. The balance, which is about $25 million, is driven from several smaller items including reagent and waste disposal costs. And as Chuck said, these are already under contract. So that's part of the breakdown of the savings, and clearly, the coal suppliers are in tight market times as well as we are. We found opportunities to build on our relationships. We've got good relationships with our coal suppliers and our transportation suppliers. We meet with them twice a year to work through these market challenges and try to find ways that we can partner in a win-win kind of an approach. So we have -- we've been successful so far. We look forward to working with them in the future."

So there's not a lot of additional delays that could be tolerated within the schedule we need to meet. So I think we are in a good place right now with regard to the timing of it, with hearings starting August 31. One thing I'd like to point out, it was after the last call that we continued to be in negotiations. And since our last call, we were able to add IEU as a nonopposing party and Kroger as a signed party. So I think what is presented to the commission is a very robust settlement.

So I think we're going to be fine there for the foreseeable future. We already had that business in a position where it was cash flow positive for the next 4 years. This makes it substantially more cash flow positive, which was the second factor in the decision to go forward with the Mansfield dewatering. All the CapEx for that project was already in the 4-year plan and already in a plan that was cash flow positive, but we've now got some margin there. And as I've said along, the game plan with that business is to keep it cash flow positive, cash -- and take that positive cash flow, and eventually, use it to start paying back the holding company for some of the loans that we made to that business a few years ago. So that's the long-term plan there."

We went and met with the editorial board, and we had what I thought was a good conversation over 1 hour and 50 minutes that then gets boiled down into an article. Once that article's written, then there's a headline writer who goes and writes a headline to try to draw attention to that article. The headline that was written for that article was completely inaccurate as to anything we discussed during that interview. In the interview, I was asked a specific question of: are we, in any way, working to get the legislature of the state to consider reregulating? And my answer was no. In the context of the discussion about the PPAs, here's my view. We are talking about trying to find ways to preserve major generating assets that have plenty of useful life left in them and keep them from closing prematurely. Exelon is looking at doing do that in Illinois and New York. Ohio utilities are looking at doing it in Ohio. You don't ever hear any conversation about needing to do that in states that are regulated. Regulated states have plenty of generation. They have integrated resource plans. And if they need more generation, they either buy or build it, so they are assured they have adequate generation to serve their customers. So these PPAs I see as a bridge to keep these plants alive long enough to allow whatever happens. If our state wants to look at that issue over time, great. But it's not going to happen fast enough for these 2 plants. If we are ultimately able to make significant corrections in the market to make sure they provide for the long-term security of baseload-generating facilities, great. But I don't think we have time to wait on that either. And yesterday, the Senate Energy Committee put forth a bill that talks about asking the markets to kind of come up with a process to make sure they ensure diversity of both fuel and types of capacity -- generating capacity across the markets. We don't have time to wait on that either. These plants are at risk today, and we need to get a decision made as to whether we're going to look at ways to protect them. So we let all of those debates and legislation in Washington, D.C. and everything else play out."

We are pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. As Jim will discuss in greater detail, these results reflect a solid performance across all 3 of our business segments.  Based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2015 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.67 to $2.75 per share from a previous range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. 
This is shaping up to be a great year for FirstEnergy, and as we look forward to 2016, our employees can be proud of what they have achieved. In addition to strong earnings, we have made tremendous progress on key initiatives that can provide us with greater strength and flexibility as we work to achieve our future goals.  So far this year, we have clarity on the results from 2 of these initiatives: the Cash Flow Improvement Project and PJM market capacity reforms. And we continue to make progress on the third initiative, the Ohio ESP.
As we discussed in July, our Cash Flow Improvement Project exceeded our initial target and should generate at least $240 million in cash flow improvements by 2017. That project, which solicit cost savings ideas from across the company, is rolling out as we expected. And we remain fully on track to capture the $58 million in cash flow improvements identified for 2015.  Overall, this effort is not only establishing a new cost structure for the company, it has also helped us initiate a culture change around spending. Employees continue to provide suggestions for meaningful and sustainable ways to reduce our cost structure, which could drive modest incremental savings going forward on top of what we have already communicated.
We are also cautiously optimistic about capacity market reforms that are now in place at PJM. Results from the base residual and transitional auctions held in August and September were in line with our expectations, with a pay-for-performance model resulting in clearing prices that come closer to reflecting the two -- true operating costs of our generating plants.
You will recall that we raised our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for our competitive business in September as a result of the higher capacity prices and all of our uncommitted generation clearing to transitional auction for the 2016, 2017 delivery years, and we are reaffirming that range. We're also raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance based on our year-to-date results and the impact of our cash flow initiative.
While Jim will provide more of the details about adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business in a few minutes, I wanted to take a moment to address our current thinking about 2017. All of our uncommitted generation cleared the 2017, 2018 transitional auction as well. But as you know, our proposed purchase power agreement in Ohio will impact generation sales for 7 months in 2016 and the full year of 2017. So while we considered providing an adjusted EBITDA range for 2017 on this call, we ultimately decided that we do not have enough information yet to offer a constructive view.  We remain committed to being transparent, and we intend to provide you with this outlook once there is more clarity.
With that said, we are pleased that the combination of our cash flow initiative and PJM capacity revenues from recent auctions will further strengthen the overall cash flow position for our competitive business. And you will recall that we already expected that business to be cash flow positive through at least 2018, prior to the incremental benefits of these 2 initiatives.
Many of you have asked if we intend to shut down additional plants. I tell our employees we are working hard to ensure all remaining generation remains viable. The results of the Ohio ESP and future auctions will give us a better understanding of the longer-term outlook on our at risk baseload power plants, and we continue to consider fuel and transportation contracts as well as environmental matters such as the EPA's Clean Power plan, which was finalized in August.
We are particularly interested in treatment of existing nuclear generation state specific emission reduction targets to compliance time line and flexibility. While we are advocating for an interpretation that allows for a thoughtful engineering-based approach to ensure reliable energy resources for our customers, we will not have full clarity on the rule's impact until state implementation plans are submitted, which could be as late as 2018, and then approved by the EPA.
To ensure that our critical baseload power plants continue operating and to help safeguard our customers against price increases and volatility, we remain committed to our Ohio electric security plan. The evidentiary hearing for the ESP began on August 31, and rebuttal testimony was filed last week. We currently expect a decision by early 2016, and we continue our discussions with the staff and other parties to reach a positive outcome for Ohio customers.
In fact, you may have noticed that Leila is not in the call today. She is in Columbus working with the ESP as we speak, and I think that's where we would all rather have her. Once we have an outcome in Ohio, we have the information necessary to more fully assess FirstEnergy's earnings for 2016, regulated growth in future years as well as our cash flow over the next several years. As we had talked about previously, at that point, we will determine future equity needs, if any, to help support our regulated growth initiatives.
We're also laying the groundwork for sustainable reliability investments in Pennsylvania. Last week, our 4 utilities in the state filed long-term infrastructure improvement plans for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In total, these plans call for a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over the next 5 years to strengthen, upgrade and modernize our distribution systems. We're anticipating the PUC's approval of the LTIP proposals by mid-February. Once we have approval of the plan, we will use the distribution system improvement charge at each company to recover the appropriate fixed costs that are part of the plans.
In New Jersey, we're further enhancing our current service reliability program with an additional $25 million spending in 2015. These expenditures, which are expected to have a $0.04 per share impact on fourth quarter 2015 earnings, will not only enhance our current service reliability program, but also demonstrate our commitment to make JCP&L a stronger company.
Of course, significant part of our growth plan includes our Energizing the Future transmission initiative, which remains on pace to invest $970 million this year with about 80% of that amount spent year-to-date.  Recent projects include final planning and preliminary site work for a new substation near Smithfield, West Virginia that will support the shale gas industry and enhance service reliability in monpower. We're also nearing completion on a transmission reinforcement project including a substation in 6-mile 138 in Harrison County, West Virginia that will enhance service reliability for more than 14,000 Mon Power customers in Harrison, Lewis and Gilmore counties. We expect the substation to be energized in December.
We are pleased to report that late yesterday afternoon, FERC approved our settlement agreement for ATSI's forward-looking formula rate structure. In addition, our proposal to move our Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L transmission assets into a new affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission, or MAIT, is moving through the FERC and state approval processes. We continue to seek final state approval for MAIT by mid-2016. If approved, we expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers.
Lastly, we remain committed to holding an analyst meeting after we have results from our Ohio case.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter and our expectation for the remainder of the year. As always, we will reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

We also welcome your questions in the Q&A or following the call.
Our strong third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2014.  On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.79 per share during the same period last year.  Our operating earnings primarily reflects higher distribution sales and the net impact of previously resolved rate cases, higher transmission revenues that resulted from our Energizing the Future initiative and ATSI forward-looking rate structure and higher commodity margin in our competitive business, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate.
In our distribution business, residential sales increased 9%, and commercial sales increased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from cooling degree days that were 36% higher than last year and 13% above normal.  Adjusting for weather, however, residential deliveries decreased nearly 1% and commercial sales were down 2.4%, reflecting the impact of energy efficiency mandate.  As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we are examining the usage trend in all 3 customer classes, particularly the impact of energy efficiency on residential usage. And we will be prepared to discuss our load forecast in more detail during our analyst meeting. However, we do believe we are seeing the effects of energy-efficient lighting sooner and with a larger impact than previous estimates.
In the industrial sector, sales decreased 3.2% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, coal mining and electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors.
In our transmission business, third quarter operating earnings increased $0.04 to $0.17 per share as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which began in January.
In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014. Commodity margin increased $0.15 per share due to favorable summer weather that was warm but not extreme, coupled with lower commodity cost. Contract sales volume decreased in line with our expectation while wholesale sales volume increased slightly. 
Variable margin benefited from higher capacity revenues, lower purchased power costs and fuel expense and lower transmission charges. Operating costs increased compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to greater expenses related to a nuclear refueling outage this quarter at Beaver Valley 2.
We remain committed to our ongoing strategy of mitigating risks by reducing sales weather-sensitive channels and have reduced the size of our residential retail book by approximately 38% since the third quarter of 2014 and also reduced the size of our weather-sensitive commercial and industrial book over the same period.
Looking at our sales position, for 2016, we have about 59 million megawatt-hours or about 75% of our expected generation resources committed, and we are currently about 45% committed for 2017 with about 36 million megawatt-hours sold.
As Chuck discussed earlier, we are raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business to $945 million to $975 million from $875 million to $950 million, based on our results for the first 9 months of the year and the projected savings from the Cash Flow Improvement Project. We are also reaffirming the 2016 adjusted EBITDA range that we provided in September of $950 million to $1,050,000,000. And as Chuck mentioned, we intend to provide 2017 adjusted EBITDA after the Ohio ESP is resolved.
Moving to other financial matters. During the September investor conferences, we received questions about our pension funding plan, so we wanted to spend a moment clarifying this topic. As we do each year, we disclosed our estimated pension funding requirements for the next several years as of December 31, 2014 in the Form 10-K that was filed in February. And as always, we include those future funding estimates in our internal long-term planning process. You'll recall that we contributed $143 million to our pension fund earlier this year. Consistent with our normal process, we will provide an update to our estimated funding requirements for future years when we file our 2015 Form 10-K this coming February.  
I will also note that we have essentially completed our financing plans for 2015, and our expected financing plans for 2016 do not include any issuance of long-term debt until the middle of next year.
As Chuck said earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a strong and important year for FirstEnergy as we create a new framework for our future. We have raised our operating earnings guidance based on the success for strategies. And we are making solid progress towards our goals of building long-term value for shareholders through predictable customer-focused regulated growth.
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

Yes, it will not show up in our operating earnings guidance. We have historically treated that as a mark-to-market. In fact, if you look at our consolidated report, we put a disclosure in there of what the range of potential impact to our GAAP earnings would be if we were to mark that pension plan effective September 30. Effective September 30, our plan had a loss on our return on assets of about 3.5% and the discount range was 4.25%. So we put a range in there assuming that our assets' return remain at that level and the discount rate would be anywhere between 4.25% and 4.5%. As you know, October's been a very good month in the equity markets. In fact, it's been one of the strongest months in history. So the return on our assets has improved somewhat. And if we had to mark that today, our discount range would be in the 4.5% range. So my expectation all things being equal, if they don't change from today, that range that we gave of $0.30 to $0.67, it would be at the lower end. In fact, it may be less than $0.37 and maybe less than $250 million that we disclosed. From a funding standpoint, we disclosed in the 10-K last year that it would be about $1,700,000,000 for the period '15 through '19. We did contributed $143 million this year. From a funding standpoint, we'll have to see where the discount rate is and where the return on assets are at the end of the year, but I don't expect anything to be materially different than what we disclosed in our 10-K in 2014."

Thank you for joining us today.  We are pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guida",1366,"Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.  We are pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. As Jim will discuss in greater detail, these results reflect a solid performance across all 3 of our business segments. Based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2015 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.67 to $2.75 per share from our previous range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. 
This is shaping up to be a great year for FirstEnergy, and as we look forward to 2016, our employees can be proud of what they have achieved. In addition to strong earnings, we have made tremendous progress on key initiatives that can provide us with greater strength and flexibility as we work to achieve our future goals. So far this year, we have clarity on the results from 2 of these initiatives: the Cash Flow Improvement Project and PJM capacity market reforms. And we continue to make progress on the third initiative, the Ohio ESP.
As we discussed in July, our Cash Flow Improvement Project exceeded our initial target, and should generate at least $240 million in cash flow improvements by 2017. That project, which solicit cost savings ideas from across the company, is rolling out as we expected. And we remain fully on track to capture the $58 million in cash flow improvements identified for 2015.  Overall, this effort is not only establishing a new cost structure for the company. It has also helped us initiate a culture change around spending. Employees continue to provide suggestions for meaningful and sustainable ways to reduce our cost structure, which could drive modest incremental savings going forward on top of what we have already communicated.
We are also cautiously optimistic about capacity market reforms that are now in place at PJM. Results from the base residual and transitional auctions held in August and September were in line with our expectations, with a pay-for-performance model resulting in clearing prices that come closer to reflecting the two -- true operating costs of our generating plants. You will recall that we raised our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for our competitive business in September as a result of the higher capacity prices and all of our uncommitted generation clearing to transitional auction for the 2016, 2017 delivery years, and we are reaffirming that range. We're also raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance based on our year-to-date results and the impact of our cash flow initiative.
While Jim will provide more of the details about adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business in a few minutes, I wanted to take a moment to address our current thinking about 2017. All of our uncommitted generation cleared the 2017, 2018 transitional auction as well. But as you know, our proposed purchase power agreement in Ohio would impact generation sales for 7 months in 2016 and the full year of 2017. So while we considered providing an adjusted EBITDA range for 2017 on this call, we ultimately decided that we do not have enough information yet to offer a constructive view.  We remain committed to being transparent, and we intend to provide you with this outlook once there is more clarity.
With that said, we are pleased that the combination of our cash flow initiative and PJM capacity revenues from recent auctions will further strengthen the overall cash flow position for our competitive business. And you will recall that we already expected that business to be cash flow positive through at least 2018, prior to the incremental benefits of these 2 initiatives.
Many of you have asked if we intend to shut down additional plants. I tell our employees we are working hard to ensure all remaining generation remains viable. The results of the Ohio ESP and future auctions will give us a better understanding of the longer-term outlook on our at risk baseload power plants, and we continue to consider fuel and transportation contracts, as well as environmental matters such as the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in August. We are particularly interested in hat rule's treatment of existing nuclear generation state specific emission reduction targets to compliance time line and state flexibility. While we are advocating for an interpretation that allows for a thoughtful engineering-based approach to ensure reliable energy resources for our customers, we will not have full clarity on the rule's impact until state implementation plans are submitted, which could be as late as 2018, and then approved by the EPA.
To ensure that our critical baseload power plants continue operating and to help safeguard our customers against price increases and volatility, we remain committed to our Ohio electric security plan. The evidentiary hearing for the ESP began on August 31, and rebuttal testimony was filed last week. We currently expect a decision by early 2016, and we continue our discussions with the PUCO staff and other parties to reach a positive outcome for Ohio customers.
In fact, you may have noticed that Leila is not on the call today. She is in Columbus working with the ESP, as we speak, and I think that's where we'd all rather have her. Once we have an outcome in Ohio, we have the information necessary to more fully assess FirstEnergy's earnings for 2016, regulated growth in future years, as well as our cash flow over the next several years. As we have talked about previously, at that point, we will determine future equity needs, if any, to help support our regulated growth initiatives.
We are also laying the groundwork for sustainable reliability investments in Pennsylvania. Last week, our 4 utilities in the state filed long-term infrastructure improvement plans with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In total, these plans call for a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over the next 5 years to strengthen, upgrade and modernize our distribution systems. We're anticipating the PUC's approval of the LTIP proposals by mid-February. Once we have approval of the plan, we will use the distribution system improvement charge at each company to recover the appropriate fixed costs that are part of the plans.
In New Jersey, we are further enhancing our current service reliability program, with an additional $25 million spending in 2015. These expenditures, which are expected to have a $0.04 per share impact on fourth quarter 2015 earnings will not only enhance our current service reliability program, but also demonstrate our commitment to make JCP&L a stronger company. Of course, significant part of our growth plan includes our Energizing the Future transmission initiative, which remains on pace to invest $970 million this year with about 80% of that amount spent year-to-date. Recent projects include final planning and preliminary site work for a new substation near Smithfield, West Virginia, that will support the shale gas industry and enhance service reliability in Mon Power. We're also nearing completion on a transmission reinforcement project including a substation in 6-mile 138 kV line in Harrison County, West Virginia that will enhance service reliability for more than 14,000 Mon Power customers in Harrison, Lewis and Gilmore counties. We expect the substation to be energized in December.
We are pleased to report that late yesterday afternoon, FERC approved our settlement agreement for ATSI's forward-looking formula rate structure. In addition, our proposal to move our Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L transmission assets into a new affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT, is moving through the FERC and state approval processes. We continue to seek final state approval for MAIT by mid-2016. If approved, we expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. Lastly, we remain committed to holding an Analyst Meeting after we have results from our Ohio case.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter and our expectation for the remainder of the year. As always, we will reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

Before I get started, I will remind you that more detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions in",843,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I will remind you that more detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions in the Q&A or following the call.
Our strong third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share compares to $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.79 per share during the same period last year. Our operating earnings primarily reflect higher distribution sales and the net impact of previously resolved rate cases, higher transmission revenues that resulted from our Energizing the Future initiative and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure and higher commodity margin in our competitive business, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate.
In our distribution business, residential sales increased 9%, and commercial sales increased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from cooling degree days that were 36% higher than last year and 13% above normal.  Adjusting for weather, however, residential deliveries decreased nearly 1% and commercial sales were down 2.4%, reflecting the impact in energy efficiency mandates. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we are examining the usage trend in all 3 customer classes, particularly the impact of energy efficiency on residential usage. And we will be prepared to discuss our load forecast in more detail during our Analyst Meeting. However, we do believe we are seeing the effects of energy-efficient lighting sooner, and with a larger impact than previous estimates.
In the industrial sector, sales decreased 3.2% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, coal mining and electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. In our transmission business, third quarter operating earnings increased $0.04 to $0.17 per share as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which began in January.
In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014. Commodity margin increased $0.15 per share due to favorable summer weather that was warm, but not extreme, coupled with lower commodity cost. Contract sales volume decreased in line with our expectation, while wholesale sales volume increased slightly. 
Variable margin benefited from higher capacity revenues, lower purchased power costs and fuel expense and lower transmission charges. Operating costs increased compared with the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to greater expenses related to a nuclear refueling outage this quarter at Beaver Valley 2.
We remain committed to our ongoing strategy of mitigating risks by reducing sales to weather-sensitive channels, and have reduced the size of our residential retail book by approximately 38% since the third quarter of 2014 and also reduced the size of our weather-sensitive commercial and industrial book over the same period. Looking at our sales position, for 2016, we have about 59 million megawatt-hours or about 75% of our expected generation resources committed, and we are currently about 45% committed for 2017, with about 36 million megawatt-hours sold.
As Chuck discussed earlier, we are raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business to $945 million to $975 million from $875 million to $950 million, based on our results for the first 9 months of the year and the projected savings from the Cash Flow Improvement Project. We are also reaffirming the 2016 adjusted EBITDA range that we provided in September of $950 million to $1,050,000,000. And as Chuck mentioned, we intend to provide 2017 adjusted EBITDA after the Ohio ESP is resolved.
Moving to other financial matters. During the September investor conferences, we received questions about our pension funding plan, so we wanted to spend a moment clarifying this topic. As we do each year, we disclosed our estimated pension funding requirements for the next several years as of December 31, 2014 in the Form 10-K that was filed in February. And as always, we include those future funding estimates in our internal long-term planning process. You'll recall that we contributed $143 million to our pension fund earlier this year. Consistent with our normal process we will provide an update to our estimated funding requirements for future years when we file our 2015 Form 10-K this coming February.  
I will also note that we have essentially completed our financing plans for 2015, and our expected financing plans for 2016 do not include any issuance of long-term debt until the middle of next year. As Chuck said earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a strong and important year for FirstEnergy, as we create a new framework for our future. We have raised our operating earnings guidance based on the success of our strategies, and we are making solid progress towards our goals of building long-term value for shareholders through predictable customer-focused regulated growth.
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And at the end of the day, I've told -- I've gone through the example of what happens when a plant -- plants close in the past. It creates spending in transmission that customers pay for.

Yes, it will not show up in our operating earnings guidance. We have historically treated that as a mark-to-market. In fact, if you look at our consolidated report, we put a disclosure in there of what the range of potential impact to our GAAP earnings would be if we were to mark that pension plan, effective September 30. Effective September 30, our plan had a loss on our return on assets of about 3.5% and the discount range was 4.25%. So we put a range in there, assuming that our assets' return will remain at that level and the discount rate would be anywhere between 4.25% and 4.5%. As you know, October's been a very good month in the equity markets. In fact, it's probably one of the strongest months in history. So the return on our assets has improved somewhat, and if we had to mark that today, our discount range would be in the 4.5% range. So my expectation, all things being equal, if they don't change from today, that range that we gave of $0.30 to $0.67, it would be at the lower end. In fact, it may be less than $0.37 and maybe less than $250 million that we disclosed. From a funding standpoint, we've disclosed in the 10-K last year that it would be about $1,700,000,000 for the period '15 through '19. We did contribute $143 million this year. From a funding standpoint, we'll have to see where the discount rate is and where the return on assets are at the end of the year, but I don't expect anything to be materially different than what we disclosed in our 10-K in 2014."

The way I would look at that Dan, is that when we went into the year, we had some relatively conservative assumptions because of the uncertainty with the forward-looking rates within ATSI, not only the ROE, but potential refunding in that.

I don't expect when we update that, '16 and '17 will be much different than what we disclosed in our 10-K for 2014, but we will just update some of the outer years based on where the return on the assets are and where the discount rate is. The Senate that just passed the, I guess, they call it the bipartisan budget bill, it extended the funding or the smoothing requirements, 3 additional years through 2020. So that will give some type of relief because you'll be able to use your historical discount rate during those funding period.

We are pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. As Jim will discuss in greater detail, these results reflect a solid performance across all 3 of our business segments. Based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2015 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.67 to $2.75 per share from our previous range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. 
This is shaping up to be a great year for FirstEnergy, and as we look forward to 2016, our employees can be proud of what they have achieved. In addition to strong earnings, we have made tremendous progress on key initiatives that can provide us with greater strength and flexibility as we work to achieve our future goals. So far this year, we have clarity on the results from 2 of these initiatives: the Cash Flow Improvement Project and PJM capacity market reforms. And we continue to make progress on the third initiative, the Ohio ESP.
As we discussed in July, our Cash Flow Improvement Project exceeded our initial target, and should generate at least $240 million in cash flow improvements by 2017. That project, which solicit cost savings ideas from across the company, is rolling out as we expected. And we remain fully on track to capture the $58 million in cash flow improvements identified for 2015.  Overall, this effort is not only establishing a new cost structure for the company. It has also helped us initiate a culture change around spending. Employees continue to provide suggestions for meaningful and sustainable ways to reduce our cost structure, which could drive modest incremental savings going forward on top of what we have already communicated.
We are also cautiously optimistic about capacity market reforms that are now in place at PJM. Results from the base residual and transitional auctions held in August and September were in line with our expectations, with a pay-for-performance model resulting in clearing prices that come closer to reflecting the two -- true operating costs of our generating plants. You will recall that we raised our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for our competitive business in September as a result of the higher capacity prices and all of our uncommitted generation clearing to transitional auction for the 2016, 2017 delivery years, and we are reaffirming that range. We're also raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance based on our year-to-date results and the impact of our cash flow initiative.
While Jim will provide more of the details about adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business in a few minutes, I wanted to take a moment to address our current thinking about 2017. All of our uncommitted generation cleared the 2017, 2018 transitional auction as well. But as you know, our proposed purchase power agreement in Ohio would impact generation sales for 7 months in 2016 and the full year of 2017. So while we considered providing an adjusted EBITDA range for 2017 on this call, we ultimately decided that we do not have enough information yet to offer a constructive view.  We remain committed to being transparent, and we intend to provide you with this outlook once there is more clarity.
With that said, we are pleased that the combination of our cash flow initiative and PJM capacity revenues from recent auctions will further strengthen the overall cash flow position for our competitive business. And you will recall that we already expected that business to be cash flow positive through at least 2018, prior to the incremental benefits of these 2 initiatives.
Many of you have asked if we intend to shut down additional plants. I tell our employees we are working hard to ensure all remaining generation remains viable. The results of the Ohio ESP and future auctions will give us a better understanding of the longer-term outlook on our at risk baseload power plants, and we continue to consider fuel and transportation contracts, as well as environmental matters such as the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in August. We are particularly interested in at rule's treatment of existing nuclear generation state specific emission reduction targets to compliance time line and state flexibility. While we are advocating for an interpretation that allows for a thoughtful engineering-based approach to ensure reliable energy resources for our customers, we will not have full clarity on the rule's impact until state implementation plans are submitted, which could be as late as 2018, and then approved by the EPA.
To ensure that our critical baseload power plants continue operating and to help safeguard our customers against price increases and volatility, we remain committed to our Ohio electric security plan. The evidentiary hearing for the ESP began on August 31, and rebuttal testimony was filed last week. We currently expect a decision by early 2016, and we continue our discussions with the PUCO staff and other parties to reach a positive outcome for Ohio customers.
In fact, you may have noticed that Leila is not on the call today. She is in Columbus working with the ESP, as we speak, and I think that's where we'd all rather have her. Once we have an outcome in Ohio, we have the information necessary to more fully assess FirstEnergy's earnings for 2016, regulated growth in future years, as well as our cash flow over the next several years. As we have talked about previously, at that point, we will determine future equity needs, if any, to help support our regulated growth initiatives.
We are also laying the groundwork for sustainable reliability investments in Pennsylvania. Last week, our 4 utilities in the state filed long-term infrastructure improvement plans with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In total, these plans call for a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over the next 5 years to strengthen, upgrade and modernize our distribution systems. We're anticipating the PUC's approval of the LTIP proposals by mid-February. Once we have approval of the plan, we will use the distribution system improvement charge at each company to recover the appropriate fixed costs that are part of the plans.
In New Jersey, we are further enhancing our current service reliability program, with an additional $25 million spending in 2015. These expenditures, which are expected to have a $0.04 per share impact on fourth quarter 2015 earnings will not only enhance our current service reliability program, but also demonstrate our commitment to make JCP&L a stronger company. Of course, significant part of our growth plan includes our Energizing the Future transmission initiative, which remains on pace to invest $970 million this year with about 80% of that amount spent year-to-date. Recent projects include final planning and preliminary site work for a new substation near Smithfield, West Virginia, that will support the shale gas industry and enhance service reliability in Mon Power. We're also nearing completion on a transmission reinforcement project including a substation and 6-mile 138 kV line in Harrison County, West Virginia that will enhance service reliability for more than 14,000 Mon Power customers in Harrison, Lewis and Gilmore counties. We expect the substation to be energized in December.
We are pleased to report that late yesterday afternoon, FERC approved our settlement agreement for ATSI's forward-looking formula rate structure. In addition, our proposal to move our Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L transmission assets into a new affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT, is moving through the FERC and state approval processes. We continue to seek final state approval for MAIT by mid-2016. If approved, we expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. Lastly, we remain committed to holding an Analyst Meeting after we have results from our Ohio case.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter and our expectation for the remainder of the year. As always, we will reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

Before I get started, I will remind you that more detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions in the Q&A or following the call.
Our strong third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share compares to $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.79 per share during the same period last year. Our operating earnings primarily reflect higher distribution sales and the net impact of previously resolved rate cases, higher transmission revenues that resulted from our Energizing the Future initiative and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure and higher commodity margin in our competitive business, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate.
In our distribution business, residential sales increased 9%, and commercial sales increased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from cooling degree days that were 36% higher than last year and 13% above normal.  Adjusting for weather, however, residential deliveries decreased nearly 1% and commercial sales were down 2.4%, reflecting the impact of energy efficiency mandates. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we are examining the usage trend in all 3 customer classes, particularly the impact of energy efficiency on residential usage. And we will be prepared to discuss our load forecast in more detail during our Analyst Meeting. However, we do believe we are seeing the effects of energy-efficient lighting sooner, and with a larger impact than previous estimates.
In the industrial sector, sales decreased 3.2% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, coal mining and electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. In our transmission business, third quarter operating earnings increased $0.04 to $0.17 per share as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which began in January.
In our competitive business, operating earnings increased $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014. Commodity margin increased $0.15 per share due to favorable summer weather that was warm, but not extreme, coupled with lower commodity cost. Contract sales volume decreased in line with our expectation, while wholesale sales volume increased slightly. 
Variable margin benefited from higher capacity revenues, lower purchased power costs and fuel expense and lower transmission charges. Operating costs increased compared with the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to greater expenses related to a nuclear refueling outage this quarter at Beaver Valley 2.
We remain committed to our ongoing strategy of mitigating risks by reducing sales to weather-sensitive channels, and have reduced the size of our residential retail book by approximately 38% since the third quarter of 2014 and also reduced the size of our weather-sensitive commercial and industrial book over the same period. Looking at our sales position, for 2016, we have about 59 million megawatt-hours or about 75% of our expected generation resources committed, and we are currently about 45% committed for 2017, with about 36 million megawatt-hours sold.
As Chuck discussed earlier, we are raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business to $945 million to $975 million from $875 million to $950 million, based on our results for the first 9 months of the year and the projected savings from the Cash Flow Improvement Project. We are also reaffirming the 2016 adjusted EBITDA range that we provided in September of $950 million to $1,050,000,000. And as Chuck mentioned, we intend to provide 2017 adjusted EBITDA after the Ohio ESP is resolved.
Moving to other financial matters. During the September investor conferences, we received questions about our pension funding plan, so we wanted to spend a moment clarifying this topic. As we do each year, we disclosed our estimated pension funding requirements for the next several years as of December 31, 2014 in the Form 10-K that was filed in February. And as always, we include those future funding estimates in our internal long-term planning process. You'll recall that we contributed $143 million to our pension fund earlier this year. Consistent with our normal process we will provide an update to our estimated funding requirements for future years when we file our 2015 Form 10-K this coming February.  
I will also note that we have essentially completed our financing plans for 2015, and our expected financing plans for 2016 do not include any issuance of long-term debt until the middle of next year. As Chuck said earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a strong and important year for FirstEnergy, as we create a new framework for our future. We have raised our operating earnings guidance based on the success of our strategies, and we are making solid progress towards our goals of building long-term value for shareholders through predictable customer-focused regulated growth.
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

Yes, it will not show up in our operating earnings guidance. We have historically treated that as a mark-to-market. In fact, if you look at our consolidated report, we put a disclosure in there of what the range of potential impact to our GAAP earnings would be if we were to mark that pension plan, effective September 30. Effective September 30, our plan had a loss on our return on assets of about 3.5% and the discount range was 4.25%. So we put a range in there, assuming that our assets' return will remain at that level and the discount rate would be anywhere between 4.25% and 4.5%. As you know, October's been a very good month in the equity markets. In fact, it's probably one of the strongest months in history. So the return on our assets has improved somewhat, and if we had to mark that today, our discount range would be in the 4.5% range. So my expectation, all things being equal, if they don't change from today, that range that we gave of $0.30 to $0.67, it would be at the lower end. In fact, it may be less than $0.37 and maybe less than $250 million that we disclosed. From a funding standpoint, we've disclosed in the 10-K last year that it would be about $1.7 billion for the period '15 through '19. We did contribute $143 million this year. From a funding standpoint, we'll have to see where the discount rate is and where the return on assets are at the end of the year, but I don't expect anything to be materially different than what we disclosed in our 10-K in 2014."

The way I would look at that Dan, is that when we went into the year, we had some relatively conservative assumptions because of the uncertainty with the forward-looking rates within ATSI, not only the ROE, but potential refunding in that. So I would say our initial estimate was somewhat conservative, and we also have a little higher rate base associated with in-servicing some of the projects sooner than we had anticipated. When I would compare, say '16 to '15, clearly, we'll give you more guidance at our Analyst Meeting. But I would say the headwinds we're going to face next year is we're going to have a lower ROE in ATSI. So that's going to impact our earnings somewhat, and some of our transmission spend will be directed towards the former GPU companies, where there's still unstated rates, and I would not look for formulaic rate recovery until beginning in 2017. So I would consider probably '15 and '16 years to be somewhat flattish, and then we will move on in '17 once we have the MAIT completed and investments going towards the GPU companies."
