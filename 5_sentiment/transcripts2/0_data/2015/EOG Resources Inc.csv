Our results continue to demonstrated our return focused capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of plays. Here are the highlights: Number on",1373,"Thank you, Tim. 2014 was another record year for EOG. Our results continue to demonstrated our return focused capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of plays. Here are the highlights: Number one, EOG demonstrated its capital efficiency for earnings pure leading returns. ROE for 2014 was 16% and ROCE was 14%. For the year, we increased crude oil production by 31%, driven by our top 3 oil plays: The Eagle for, Bakken and Delaware Basin. NGL production increased 23%, natural gas production held flat yielding total company production growth of 17%. 
We announced 5 new plays, 4 in the Rockies, DJ and Powder River Basin and the Second Bone Spring Sand play on the Delaware Basin side of the Permian. These plays add flexibility to our portfolio of options to grow production in the coming years. Also in the Delaware Basin, we identified an oil window in our existing Wolfcamp acreage. Early in 2014, we increased the reserve potential in the Eagle Ford 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to the EOG. Between that Eagle Ford reserve increase and the new Rockies play alone, we added 1.4 billion barrels of potential reserves to our portfolio and 2,300 high-return net drilling locations. In recent years, we have consistently added twice as many locations as we drilled. 
Finally, EOG remained laser-focused on cost by driving down pro-well expenses in all of our major plays while simultaneously driving up well productivity. Before I move on to 2015, I'd like to expand on that last highlight. We have demonstrated a unique ability to get the most oil plays on both the cost and well productivity standpoint. Over the last 10 years, we have developed expertise across all the disciplines required to drill in shale and other type rock  and make that drilling highly economic. This proven ability is why we posted strong returns in 2014 and while we are is so well positioned to not only weather the current oil price environment, but to take advantage of it. 
So now let's talk about EOG's goals for 2015. First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery. It is clear that current process are too low to meet the world supply needs and the market will rebalance. We will be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices and resume our leadership in high-return oil growth. Second, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. And let me repeat. We do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at today's strip classes. 
2015 cash flows should fund our CapEx budget of approximately $5 billion. Third, returns are what matter. Therefore, we will focus capital on the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays. At $55 oil, these premier assets deliver a direct after-tax rate of return greater than 35% without factoring in the potential for additional service cost reductions. 
I'll now explain in further detail how we plan to prepare for the oil price recovery. First, we will reduce average rigs 50% to under 27 for 2015 and intentionally delay any of our completions, building a significant inventory of approximately 350 uncompleted wells. This allows EOG to use rigs under existing commitments and when process improve, we will be poised to ramp up completions. Oil price improvement of even a few dollars generates incremental MPV. So delaying completions related to improved process [indiscernible] will occur will add significant value. 
Please see Slide 8 of our investor presentation for our play-specific example. Second, we remain focused on driving down funding cost and improving pro-well production rates. This is our best edge among oil prices. For example, as a result of cost and well productivity improvements in the Eagle Ford Western acreage, we can now generate better returns of $65 oil than we did with $95 oil just 2 or 3 years ago. We illustrate this on Slide 11 of the Investor presentation. Due to low oil prices, we have already seen service cost reductions in many areas and see the potential for 10% to 30% vendor savings during this downturn. 
Additionally, every one of our plays has room to produce cost further through ongoing efficiency gains. We believe our integrated approach to completion technology is industry-leading. Quarter-after-quarter, we make improvements in well productivity and that will continue to be a high-priority this year for EOG. Third, low oil prices mean unique opportunities to add low cost, high-quality acreage. We will continue to grow our acreage portfolio to the [indiscernible] tactical acquisitions. We view our strong balance sheet and excess liquidity as a strategic asset for opportunities in times like these. We are already benefiting from the oil down cycle, adding new leases at lower cost than last year. And we're optimistic that additional opportunities will become available. 
Finally, in my 36 years with the company, I've seen many downturns and each time, EOG stays discplined, performs well and emerges on the other side and better shape than we entered it. In 2015, EOG plans to build a stronger position and be ready to long term, high return production growth when process improves. 
I will now address the Eagle Ford. David Trice will discuss the Permian Basin and Billy Helms will provide an update on the Bakken and Rockies plays along with the reserves. 2014 was another remarkable year in the Eagle Ford. Oil productions on the play increased 45% and EOG achieved several key milestones. Number one, downspacing and completion techniques enabled us to increase our total potential reserve estimate of 2014 by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels a proven that the EOG. We continue to advance our technical expertise as evidenced by ongoing improvements in productivity across the field.  Slide 17 and our updated investor presentation shows an 8% increase of productivity for wells completed in 2014 versus 2013. 
We continue our progress with high-density completions across the entire play. High-density completion is simply various techniques used to maximize the amount of rock connected to the wellbore. These ideologies, those techniques will change from one county to the next and we're making progress determining how to tweak those techniques across our acreage. #4, after 5 years in the Eagle Ford, we're still making drilling time and cost improvements. Please see Slide 18 in the investor presentation. #5, at the end of 2014, our acreage in the Eagle Ford was over 80% followed by production. We have a number of lease retention commitments in our Western acres that we successfully fulfilled in 2014, freeing up drilling flexibility going forward. Eagle Ford activity in 2015 will continue to be balance between the west and east sides of the field. As I mentioned, we are intentionally delay completions why we wait on improved product launches, thus our inventory of uncompleted wells is expected to increase. This strategy allows us to maximize the value of our existing contractual commitments while waiting on improved pricing before we bring on newly completed wells with high oil production rates. Delaying completions will also provide an opportunity to take advantage of lower service cost that will likely materialize in the coming months. 
The Eagle Ford remains EOG's premier play. We have about 5,500 net wells to drill on our acreage, over 10 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford represents a huge call option on oil that EOG can exercise at any time to take advantage of unfavorable oil price environment. We often referred the Eagle Ford as our technology laboratory. Our understanding of the field and how to increase its recovery rate has led to improvements in plays across the entire company. The first to benefit from this technology transfer was the Bakken beginning in late 2012 and now the Permian Basin is experiencing the latest step change in our application of technology. 
I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss activities in the Permian."

In 2015, EOG's capital budget in the Permian will expand to take advantage of new Delaware Basin targets, advancements in well performance and cost reductions achieved in 2014. If you recall, last year we shifted capital from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin, which allowed us to advance our technical understanding of the Delaware. In 2015, we will have fewer drilling commitments to hold acreage in the Midland Basin which frees up capital and provides more flexibility. 
Let's quickly review the 2014 achievements that set this play up to be a major contributor to EOG's returns and long-term growth. First, we made significant advancements in our most mature oil play in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale, by increasing well productivity 17%. In 2015, we will continue to push wells closer together, developing and further testing down to 300 feet. We are encouraged with initial results and expect to see further advancements throughout the year. Second, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, we made great progress in 2014 as the play moved into development both. We greatly increased well productivity as evidenced by the 3 wells we highlighted in our press release. As a $7 million completed well cost, the Wolfcamp play deliveries very strong returns. Also in the Wolfcamp during 2014, we identified and delineated 90,000 net acres in the oil window. Third, we've tested improved the second  Bone Spring Sand to be another high return oil target in our Delaware Basin acreage. Initial results were promising and we get extensive G&G work to delineate this play. The Second Bone Spring Sand produces 70% oil in our Red Hills acreage in Mexico and promises returns on par with our premier oil plays. We will move the Second Bone Spring Sand into development both this year and it will receive the largest relative increase in capital. 
 
In summary, the Leonard shale is in full development mode and continues to deliver impressive results. The Delaware Basin-Wolfcamp finished its first year of development drilling, the wells are outstanding and the costs are dropping. And we are excited to add the Second Bone Spring Sand to the drilling program and bring it forward into full development mode. We are confident that we will see the same progress in the Second Bone Spring Sand that we've seen from the Leonard shale over the last 2 years. While the Delaware Basin is still in early innings of its exploration and development, the returns we are already generating from multiple targets make it very competitive with Eagle Ford and the Bakken. Billy Helms will now discuss the Bakken, the Rockies and the year-end reserves."
269660,281963734,765658,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began downspacing, testing various basin patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field.

We began downspacing, testing various basin patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for the 2014's activity. 
First, we made significant advancements in improving drilling times and reducing well cost. A typical 10,000-foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days with a completed well cost of $9.3 million. This represents a cost reduction of 11% from 2013 and we expect more efficiency gains and service cost reductions in the current environment. 
Second, we now have production data from each of the various basin patterns and can begin to determine the optimal development plan. We have tested wells at 1,300-foot, 700-foot and 500-foot spacing patterns and have just started producing wells in a 300-foot spacing pattern. Similar to the Eagle Ford, we expect that is spacing will vary depending on the specific rock characteristics in each area of the field. One of our latest test is a 6-well pattern with well spaced 700 feet apart in the Bakken core. Initial production rates of these wells range from 1,000 barrels of oil per day to 1,900 barrels of oil per day and represent a customized completion design for the Rock property in this particular area of the field. 
Third, we are confident that there is a significant amount of remaining potential in the Bakken and that downspacing will be highly economic. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the production from each spacing pattern will lead us to the proper spacing and the ultimate reserve potential. While the Bakken will receive is less capital in 2015, it remains a core, high-return asset in our drilling program. A typical 10,000-foot lateral in the Bakken Core generates greater than 35% after-tax rate of return with a $55 flat oil price. In addition, maintaining activity allows us to gain momentum on operational efficiencies. For example, we recently drilled an 18,600-foot well to total depth in just over 7 days. We continue to believe that EOG has the premier acreage position in the play with many years of development drilling remaining and the potential for long-term production growth. 
In the DJ Basin, EOG made significant progress in both the Codell and Niobrara. We have been experimenting with wellbore targeting, interwell spacing and modification to the completion design for both intervals. For the Codell, we have identified a specific stratigraphic interval within the section that when targeted, greatly enhances the performance of the well. The improved completion techniques we use are even more effective when we focus on this target. Please see our press release for some notable well results.
Like the Codell, we have tested several targets within the Niobrara. With this additional testing, we have determined the correlation between the amount of lateral focus within a specific target interval and the production performance of the well. In 2014, we made progress in several areas that contributed to reaching our well and operating cost goals in the DJ Basin. This include drilling and completion efficiency and oil and gas gathering system, the water gathering and distribution system and the infrastructure needed to obtain EOG sand. Our activity in 2015 in the DJ Basin will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on the few remaining wells drilled last year.
The Powder River Basin is a stack pay system where we have drilled primarily in the Parkman and Turner oil reservoirs. Similar to other areas within EOG's portfolio, in 2014, we focused on well targeting in completions designs and interval spacing to determine the optimal development plan. We made significant improvements in all aspects during 2014. Please see our press release for some excellent fourth quarter well results in both the Parkman and Turner plays. We plan to have limited activity in the Powder River Basin in 2015 while we wait for commodity prices to improve. 
I'll now address reserve replacement and funding cost. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 249% of our 2014 production at a low funding cost of $13.25 per BOE. Proved reserves increased 18% and more than half of our reserve growth by crude oil. In addition, net proved develop reserves increased 20%. For the 27th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton did an independent engineering analysis of our reserves and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 76% of our provend reserves this year. Please see the schedule accompanying their earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and funding cost. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structures."

In early December, we announced the sale of most of our producing assets in Canada for proceeds of approximately $400 million. As a result, volumes were lower than our previous guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 15 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also G&A for the quarter was higher due to $21.5 million of exit cost related to the sale. Now I'll make a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. 
Capitalized interest of the quarter was $14.5 million. For the fourth quarter 2014, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $140 million. There were $66 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2014, capitalized interest was $57.2 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $727 million. 
For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $8.3 billion. Total cash flow from operations was $8.6 billion, exceeding total cash expenditures. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $569 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $139 million. 
At year end, total debt outstanding was $5.9 million for debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%. Taking into account $2.1 billion of cash on hand at year end, net debt to total cap was 18%, down from 23% at year end 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, total impairments were $536 million. $445 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, total impairments were $744 million. $501 million of these impairments are result of declines in commodity prices and negotiated sales prices and property sales. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were ongoing lease and producing property impairment. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 61% and the deferred tax ratio was 104%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release the first quarter and full year 2015. Our 2015 CapEx estimate is $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for approximately 80% of the total CapEx budget. 2015 CapEx represents a 40% decrease from 2014. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment. The budget for exploration and development facilities accounts for approximately 12% of the total CapEx budget for 2015 and midstream accounts were 8%. We plan to concentrate our spending on infrastructure in the Eagle furred and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies. 
In terms of hedges. For February 1 through June 30, 2015, we have 47,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we have 10,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $89.98 per barrel. This represents a small portion of our estimated oil production in 2015 and we will look at further volumes opportunistically throughout the year. We have contracts outstanding for 37,000 barrels of oil per day that could be put to us at various terms. Please see the press release for further details. 
For natural gas, we have 182,000 Mmbtu per day hedged at $4.51 per MMBtu you from March 1 through December 31, 2015. We also have a number of contracts for natural gas that can be put to us at various terms. If counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1 through December 31, 2015. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Bill."

We were encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting the ban on crude exports.

We were encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting the ban on crude exports. Doing so will bring a wide range of economic and geopolitical benefits including strengthening the U.S. energy sector, growing the U.S. economy, creating jobs, dramatically improving the U.S. trade deficit, providing our European allies with more secure supplies and lowering gasoline prices to U.S. consumers. 
As I mentioned earlier, EOG will be very focused this year on preparing for the recovery in oil prices. The current supply/demand imbalance is not very large and current process are far short of what is necessary to sustain the supply need to meet world demand growth. When prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth. For now, EOG is intentionally choosing returns over growth. In fact, that's the way it's always been here at EOG. 
In summary, I want to leave you with some important summary points. Year in, year out, EOG consistently approaches capital planning by focusing on returns. 2015 is no different. Second, we have halted production growth deliberately. While EOG is one of the few companies that can earn a healthy return at today's oil prices, we are not interested in growing oil into the low price environment. As we compare today's oil prices to expectations for a more balanced market, it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry-wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly. This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and is the right strategy to create long-term shareholder value. 
Third, our balance sheet places EOG on a strong position. We intend to use our financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to grow our inventory by acquiring low cost, high-quality acreage. And fourth, with a substantial inventory of high-volume wells to complete, we will be ready to return to double-digit oil growth as oil prices improve. 
And finally, we fully expect to emerge from this commodity price down cycle in a stronger position than we entered it. And 2015, we have more opportunity than ever to lower funding costs and development cost and improve returns in 2015 and beyond. 
Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A."

Certainly, because we're deferring these completions because we do believe that prices would be better in the future and even a $10 increase in oil price gives us a significant additional return on our investment and MPV upside. So really our rate of return focus and our capital return focus is really what's driving the deferral. And let me kind of walk you through. There's 2 parts of this deferral. One is, as Gary said, we're starting out 2015 with about 200 uncompleted wells in our inventory. And that uncompleted well inventory will grow throughout 2015 and if oil prices improve and it looks something like the forward curve in the $60 range, then we would begin competing many of those wells starting in the third quarter of 2015 and that would reflect additional growth in the fourth quarter heading into 2016. So we went ahead into 2016 on an uptick in production growth. So our curve in 2015 will be U shaped. It will be the lowest production will be in the second quarter and in the third quarter and then production will begin to increase in the fourth quarter as we head into 2016. Then at the end of the year, we'll have about 285 wells in inventory to start the 2016 process and that will give us a bit of an advantage as we go into 2016 and we'll be able to grow oil in very strong double-digit rates and be able to stay free cash flow neutral in a $65 oil price environment. So hopefully that gives a bit of more understanding of what we're thinking."

Our results continue to demonstrate our return focus, capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of tight plays.Here are the highlights. Numb",1396,"Thank you, Tim. 2014 was another record year for EOG. Our results continue to demonstrate our return focus, capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of tight plays.
Here are the highlights. Number one, EOG demonstrated its capital efficiency by earning pure leading returns. ROE for 2014 was 16% and ROCE was 14%. For the year, we increased crude oil production by 31%, driven by our top 3 oil plays: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. NGL production increased 23%, while natural gas production held flat, yielding total company production growth of 17%.
We announced 5 new plays, 4 in the Rockies, DJ and Powder River Basins and the Second Bone Spring Sand play on the Delaware Basin side of the Permian. These plays add flexibility to our portfolio of options to grow production in coming years. 
Also in the Delaware Basin, we identified an oil window in our existing Wolfcamp acreage. Early in 2014, we increased the reserve potential in the Eagle Ford 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, net to EOG. Between that Eagle Ford reserve increase and the new Rockies play alone, we added 1.4 billion barrels of potential reserves to our portfolio and 2,300 high-return net drilling locations. In recent years, we have consistently added twice as many locations as we drilled.
Finally, EOG remain laser-focused on costs by driving down per well expenses in all of our major plays, while simultaneously driving up well productivity.
Before I move on to 2015, I'd like to expand on that last highlight. We have demonstrated a unique ability to get the most out of tight oil plays from both a cost and well productivity standpoint. Over the last 10 years, we have developed expertise across all the disciplines required to drill in shale and other tight rock and make that drilling highly economic. This proven ability is why we posted strong returns in 2014. And while we are so well positioned to not only weather the current low price environment, but to take advantage of it.
So now let's talk about EOG's goals for 2015. First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery. It is clear that current prices are too low to meet the world's supply needs, and the market will rebalance. We will be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices improve and resume our leadership in high-return oil growth.
Second, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. And let me repeat, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at today's strip prices. 
2015 cash flows should fund our CapEx budget of approximately $5 billion.
Third, returns are what matter. Therefore, we will focus capital on the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays. At $55 oil, these premier assets deliver a direct after tax rate of return greater than 35% without factoring in the potential for additional service cost reductions.
I'll now explain in further detail how we plan to prepare for the oil price recovery. First, we will reduce average rigs 50% to under 27 for 2015 and intentionally delay many of our completions, building a significant inventory of approximately 350 uncompleted wells. This allows EOG to use rigs under existing commitments. And when prices improve, we will be poised to ramp up completions. Oil price improvement of even a few dollars generates incremental NPV. So delaying completions, while waiting for improved prices, as evidenced by the forward curve, will add significant value.
Please see Slide 8 of our investor presentation for our play-specific example.
Second, we remain focused on driving down finding costs and improving per well production rates. This is our best hedge against low oil prices. For example, as a result of cost and well productivity improvements in the Eagle Ford Western acreage, we can now generate better returns with $65 oil than we did with $95 oil just 2 or 3 years ago. We illustrate this on Slide 11 of the investor presentation. Due to low oil prices, we have already seen service cost reductions in many areas and see the potential for 10% to 30% vendor savings during this downturn.
Additionally, every one of our plays has room to reduce costs further through ongoing efficiency gains. We believe our integrated approach to completion technology is industry leading. Quarter-after-quarter, we make improvements to well productivity, and that will continue to be a high priority this year for EOG.
Third, low oil prices mean unique opportunities to add low-cost, high-quality acreage. We will continue to grow our acreage portfolio through leasehold, farm-in or tactical acquisitions. We view our strong balance sheet and excess liquidity as a strategic asset for opportunities in times like these. We are already benefiting from the oil down cycle, adding new leases at lower costs than last year. And we're optimistic that additional opportunities will become available.
Finally, in my 36 years with the company, I've seen many downturns, and each time EOG stays disciplined, performs well and emerges on the other side in better shape than we entered it. In 2015, EOG plans to build a stronger position and be ready to resume long-term, high return production growth when prices improve.
I will now address the Eagle Ford. David Trice will discuss the Permian Basin and Billy Helms will provide an update on the Bakken and Rockies plays along with the review of our year-end reserves. 2014 was another remarkable year in the Eagle Ford. Oil productions on the play increased 45%, and EOG achieved several key milestones.
Number one, downspacing and improved completion techniques enabled us to increase our total potential reserve estimate in 2014 by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels equivalent, net to EOG. We continue to advance our technical expertise as evidenced by ongoing improvements in productivity across the field.
Slide 17 in our updated investor presentation shows an 8% increase of productivity for wells completed in 2014 versus 2013. 
We continue our progress with high-density completions across the entire play. High-density completion is simply various techniques used to maximize the amount of rock connected to the wellbore. Due to geologies, those techniques will change from one county to the next, and we're making progress determining how to tweak those techniques across our acreage. 
Number four. After 5 years in the Eagle Ford, we're still making drilling time and cost improvements. Please see Slide 18 in the investor presentation.
And number five. At the end of 2014, our acreage in the Eagle Ford was over 80% held by production. We had a number of lease retention commitments in our Western acres that we successfully fulfilled in 2014, freeing up drilling flexibility going forward.
Eagle Ford activity in 2015 will continue to be balanced between the west and east sides of the field. As I mentioned, we are intentionally delaying completions while we wait on improved product prices. Thus, our inventory of uncompleted wells is expected to increase. This strategy allows us to maximize the value of our existing contractual commitments while waiting on improved pricing before we bring on newly completed wells with high oil production rates. Delaying completions will also provide an opportunity to take advantage of lower service costs that will likely materialize in the coming months.
The Eagle Ford remains EOG's premier play. We have about 5,500 net wells to drill on our acreage, over 10 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford represents a huge call option on oil that EOG can exercise at any time to take advantage of a favorable oil price environment. We often refer to the Eagle Ford as our technology laboratory. Our understanding in this field and how to increase its recovery rate has led to improvements in plays across the entire company. The first to benefit from this technology transfer was the Bakken beginning in late 2012. And now the Permian Basin is experiencing the latest step change in our application of technology.
I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss activities in the Permian."

In 2015, EOG's capital budget in the Permian will expand to take advantage of new Delaware Basin targets, advancements in well performance and cost reductions achieved in 2014. If you'll recall, last year, we shifted capital from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin, which allowed us to advance our technical understanding of the Delaware. In 2015, we will have fewer drilling commitments to hold acreage in the Midland Basin, which frees up capital and provides more flexibility.
Let's quickly review the 2014 achievements that set this play up to be a major contributor to EOG's returns and long-term growth. First, we made significant advancements in our most mature oil play in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale, by increasing well productivity 17%. In 2015, we will continue to push wells closer together, developing and further testing down to 300 feet. We are encouraged with the initial results and expect to see further advancements throughout the year.
Second, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, we made great progress in 2014, as the play moved into development mode. We greatly increased well productivity as evidenced by the 3 wells we highlighted in our press release. At a $7 million completed well cost, the Wolfcamp play delivers very strong returns. Also in the Wolfcamp during 2014, we identified and delineated 90,000 net acres in the oil window.
Third, we tested and proved the Second Bone Spring Sand to be another high return oil target in our Delaware Basin acreage. Initial results were promising and we did extensive G&G work to delineate this play. The Second Bone Spring Sand produces 70% oil in our Red Hills acreage in New Mexico and promises returns on par with our premier oil plays. We will move the Second Bone Spring Sand into development mode this year, and it will receive the largest relative increase in capital.
 
In summary, the Leonard shale is in full development mode and continues to deliver impressive results. The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp finished its first year of development drilling. The wells are outstanding and the costs are dropping. And we are excited to add the Second Bone Spring Sand to the drilling program and bring it forward into full development mode. We are confident that we will see the same progress in the Second Bone Spring Sand that we have seen from the Leonard Shale over the last 2 years. While the Delaware Basin is still in early innings of its exploration and development, the returns we are already generating from multiple targets make it very competitive with Eagle Ford and the Bakken.
Billy Helms will now discuss the Bakken, the Rockies and year-end reserves."
269660,281963734,765972,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began downspacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for 20",793,"Thanks, David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began downspacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for 2014's activity.
First, we made significant advancements in improving drilling times and reducing well cost. A typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days with a completed well cost of $9.3 million. This represents a cost reduction of 11% from 2013, and we expect more efficiency gains and service cost reductions in the current environment.
Second, we now have production data from each of the various spacing patterns and can begin to determine the optimal development plan. We have tested wells at 1,300 foot, 700 foot and 500 foot spacing patterns and have just started producing wells in the 300 foot spacing pattern. Similar to the Eagle Ford, we expect that the spacing will vary depending on the specific rock characteristics in each area of the field. One of our latest test is a 6-well pattern with well spaced 700 feet apart in the Bakken core. Initial production rates of these wells range from 1,000 barrels of oil per day to 1,900 barrels of oil per day and represent a customized completion design tied for the rock properties in this particular area of the field.
Third, we are confident that there is a significant amount of remaining potential in the Bakken and that downspacing will be highly economic. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the production from each spacing pattern will lead us to the appropriate spacing and the ultimate reserve potential. While the Bakken will receive less capital in 2015, it remains a core, high-return asset in our drilling program. A typical 10,000 foot lateral in the Bakken core generates greater than 35% after tax rate of return with a $55 flat oil price.
In addition, maintaining activity allows us to retain momentum on operational efficiencies. For example, we recently drilled an 18,600 foot well to total depth in just over 7 days. We continue to believe that EOG has the premier acreage position in the play with many years of development drilling remaining and the potential for long-term production growth.
In the DJ Basin, EOG made significant progress in both the Codell and Niobrara. We have been experimenting with wellbore targeting, inter-well spacing and modification to the completion design for both intervals. For the Codell, we have identified a specific stratigraphic interval within the pay section that when targeted, greatly enhances the performance of the well. The improved completion techniques we use are even more effective when we focus on this target. Please see our press release for some notable well results.
Like the Codell, we had tested several targets within the Niobrara. With this additional testing, we have determined the correlation between the amount of lateral focus within a specific target interval and the production performance of the well. In 2014, we made progress in several areas that contributed to reaching our well and operating cost goals in the DJ Basin. This included drilling and completion efficiencies and oil and gas gathering system, the water gathering and distribution system and the infrastructure needed to obtain EOG self-sourced sand.
Our activity in 2015 in the DJ Basin will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few remaining wells drilled last year.
The Powder River Basin is a stacked pay system, where we have drilled primarily in the Parkman and Turner oil reservoirs. Similar to other areas within EOG's portfolio, in 2014, we focused on well targeting, improved completion designs and interval spacing to determine the optimal development plan. We made significant improvements in all aspects during 2014. Please see our press release for some excellent fourth quarter well results in both the Parkman and Turner plays. We plan to have limited activity in the Powder River Basin in 2015, while we wait for commodity prices to improve. 
I'll now address reserve replacement and finding costs. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 249% of our 2014 production at a low finding cost of $13.25 per BOE. Proved reserves increased 18% and more than half of our reserve growth was driven by crude oil. In addition, net proved, developed reserves increased 20%.
For the 27th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton did an independent engineering analysis of our reserves, and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 76% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

As a result, volumes were lower than our",686,"Thanks, Billy. Let me start by addressing an unusual item affecting the fourth quarter. In early December, we announced the sale of most of our producing assets in Canada for proceeds of approximately $400 million. As a result, volumes were lower than our previous guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 15 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also G&A for the quarter was higher due to $21.5 million of exit costs related to the sale.
Now I'd like to make a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter.
Capitalized interest for the quarter was $14.5 million. For the fourth quarter 2014, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $140 million. There were $66 million of acquisitions during the quarter.
For the full year 2014, capitalized interest was $57.2 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $727 million.
For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $8.3 billion. Total cash flow from operations was $8.6 billion, exceeding total cash expenditures. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $569 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $139 million.
At year-end, total debt outstanding was $5.9 million for debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%. Taking into account $2.1 billion of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total cap was 18%, down from 23% at year-end 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, total impairments were $536 million. $445 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, total impairments were $744 million. $501 million of these impairment is a result of declines in commodity prices and negotiated sales prices for [ph] property sales. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were ongoing lease and producing property impairment.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 61% and the deferred tax ratio was 104%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2015. Our 2015 CapEx estimate is $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for approximately 80% of the total CapEx budget. 2015 CapEx represents a 40% decrease from 2014. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment. The budget for exploration and development facilities accounts for approximately 12% of the total CapEx budget for 2015 and midstream accounts for 8%. We plan to concentrate our spending on infrastructure in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies.
In terms of hedges. For February 1 through June 30, 2015, we have 47,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we have 10,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $89.98 per barrel. This represents a small portion of our estimated oil production in 2015, and we will look to hedge further volumes opportunistically throughout the year. We have contracts outstanding for 37,000 barrels of oil per day that could be put to us at various terms. Please see the press release for further details.
For natural gas, we have 182,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.51 per MMBtu from March 1 through December 31, 2015. We also have a number of contracts on natural gas that could be put to us at various terms. If counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1 through December 31, 2015.
Now I'll turn it back over to Bill."

We are encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting the ban on crude oil exports. Doing so will bring a wide range of economic and geopolitical benefits, including strengthening the U.S. energy sector, growing the U.S. economy, creating jobs, dramatically improving the U.S. trade deficit, providing our European allies with more secure supplies and lowering gasoline prices to U.S. consumers.
As I mentioned earlier, EOG will be very focused this year on preparing for the recovery in oil prices. The current supply-demand imbalance is not very large and current process are far short of what is necessary to sustain the supply need to meet world demand growth. When prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth. For now, EOG is intentionally choosing returns over growth. In fact, that's the way it's always been here at EOG.
In summary, I want to leave you with some important summary points. Year in, year out, EOG consistently approaches capital planning by focusing on returns. 2015 is no different. Second, we have halted production growth deliberately. While EOG is one of the few companies that can earn a healthy return at today's oil prices, we are not interested in growing oil into a low price environment. As we compare today's oil prices to our expectations for a more balanced market, it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry-wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly. This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and is the right strategy to create long-term shareholder value.
Third, our balance sheet places EOG on a strong position. We intend to use our financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to grow our inventory by acquiring low-cost, high-quality acreage.
And fourth, with a substantial inventory of high-volume wells to complete, we will be ready to return to double-digit oil growth as oil prices improve.
And finally, we fully expect to emerge from this commodity price down cycle in a stronger position than we entered it. In 2015, we have more opportunity than ever to lower finding costs and development costs and improve returns in 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

I wanted to confirm that the overarching decision you've made here is to get CapEx in line with expected cash flows; and secondly, that by increasing efficiency, allowing for lower service costs, even if oil prices remain low for another year, you would be able to deliver growth in 2016 while keeping CapEx within cash flows.

Paul, the first statement is generally correct. Number one, we do not think it's wise or prudent to accelerate oil when oil prices are low, especially if the rebound in price could come certainly in the next -- this year, the end of this year or maybe even next year. So there's no use in trying to accelerate -- it makes much more prudent business decision to wait, and that will give us much more capital returns if we do that. And we are very committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet. So we don't want to outspend trying to grow oil in a low price environment. And we want to keep our balance sheet clean and low and we want to keep our powder dry, so that we will be able to take some advantage of what could be some unique opportunities in this downturn. In 2016, yes, if we -- if things go as we think they might could and we would have, say, a $65 oil environment in 2016, then we believe that we could return to a very strong double-digit oil growth that we've been marching towards over the last few years and that we will be able to generate very high rates of return on our capital and we would be able to stay free cash flow neutral."

And even a $10 increase in oil price gives us a significant additional return on our investment and NPV upside. So really our rate of return focus and our capital return focus is really what's driving the deferral. And let me kind of walk you through. There's 2 parts of this deferral. One is, as Gary said, we're starting out 2015 with about 200 uncompleted wells in our inventory. And that uncompleted well inventory will grow throughout 2015. And if oil prices improve and they look something like the forward curve in the $60 range, then we would begin completing many of those wells starting in the third quarter of 2015, and that would reflect additional growth in the fourth quarter heading into 2016. So we want to head into 2016 on an uptick in production growth. So our curve in 2015 would be U shaped. It will be -- the lowest production will be in the second quarter and in the third quarter and then production will begin to increase in the fourth quarter as we head into 2016. Then at the end of the year, we'll have about 285 wells in inventory to start the 2016 process, and that will give us a bit of an advantage as we go into 2016, and we'll be able to grow oil at very strong double-digit rates and be able to stay free cash flow neutral in a $65 oil price environment.

We're expecting -- we're setting our target -- we hope to see somewhere around 5.5% or about a 10% reduction. In the Bakken, we've got 9.3%. Our target would be to further lower that. About 9.3% in '14, we've got 8.2% is our planned number. But we've got a target that's slightly less than that, maybe 19%.

One is every year that goes by, our well base gets more mature. We've got older wells, bigger percentage of older wells all the time. And so that's slowing the process. Number two, our completion technology is really beginning to -- starting to flatten out our decline rates on a per well basis. Specifically, the high-density fracs that we talked about in the last quarter that we're applying in the Eagle Ford are not only increasing the initial rates, but are also decreasing the decline rate there. So we're very encouraged about that. And then number three, as we go forward, we are targeting plays that have better rocks with better permeability and better ability to flow oil. And those rocks, such as the sandstone plays in the Delaware Basin and in Wyoming, have lower decline rates also. So the mix of our decline rate in the company is slowing over time due to a number of different reasons."

Our results continue to demonstrate our return focus, capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of tight plays.Here are the highlights. Numb",1398,"Thank you, Tim. 2014 was another record year for EOG. Our results continue to demonstrate our return focus, capital discipline and EOG's superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of tight plays.
Here are the highlights. Number one, EOG demonstrated its capital efficiency by earning pure leading returns. ROE for 2014 was 16% and ROCE was 14%. For the year, we increased crude oil production by 31%, driven by our top 3 oil plays: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. NGL production increased 23%, while natural gas production held flat, yielding total company production growth of 17%.
We announced 5 new plays, 4 in the Rockies, DJ and Powder River Basins and the Second Bone Spring Sand play on the Delaware Basin side of the Permian. These plays add flexibility to our portfolio of options to grow production in coming years. 
Also in the Delaware Basin, we identified an oil window in our existing Wolfcamp acreage. Early in 2014, we increased the reserve potential in the Eagle Ford 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, net to EOG. Between that Eagle Ford reserve increase and the new Rockies play alone, we added 1.4 billion barrels of potential reserves to our portfolio and 2,300 high-return net drilling locations. In recent years, we have consistently added twice as many locations as we drilled.
Finally, EOG remain laser-focused on costs by driving down per well expenses in all of our major plays, while simultaneously driving up well productivity.
Before I move on to 2015, I'd like to expand on that last highlight. We have demonstrated a unique ability to get the most out of tight oil plays from both a cost and well productivity standpoint. Over the last 10 years, we have developed expertise across all the disciplines required to drill in shale and other tight rock and make that drilling highly economic. This proven ability is why we posted strong returns in 2014. And while we are so well positioned to not only weather the current low price environment, but to take advantage of it.
So now let's talk about EOG's goals for 2015. First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery. It is clear that current prices are too low to meet the world's supply needs, and the market will rebalance. We will be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices improve and resume our leadership in high-return oil growth.
Second, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. And let me repeat, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle, low price environment is the right thing to do. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at today's strip prices. 
2015 cash flows should fund our CapEx budget of approximately $5 billion.
Third, returns are what matter. Therefore, we will focus capital on the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays. At $55 oil, these premier assets deliver a direct after tax rate of return greater than 35% without factoring in the potential for additional service cost reductions.
I'll now explain in further detail how we plan to prepare for the oil price recovery. First, we will reduce average rigs 50% to under 27 for 2015 and intentionally delay many of our completions, building a significant inventory of approximately 350 uncompleted wells. This allows EOG to use rigs under existing commitments. And when prices improve, we will be poised to ramp up completions. Oil price improvement of even a few dollars generates incremental NPV. So delaying completions while waiting for improved prices, as evidenced by the forward curve, will add significant value.
Please see Slide 8 of our investor presentation for our play-specific example.
Second, we remain focused on driving down finding costs and improving per well production rates. This is our best hedge against low oil prices. For example, as a result of cost and well productivity improvements in the Eagle Ford Western acreage, we can now generate better returns with $65 oil than we did with $95 oil just 2 or 3 years ago. We illustrate this on Slide 11 of the investor presentation. Due to low oil prices, we have already seen service cost reductions in many areas and see the potential for 10% to 30% vendor savings during this downturn.
Additionally, every one of our plays has room to reduce costs further through ongoing efficiency gains. We believe our integrated approach to completion technology is industry leading. Quarter after quarter, we make improvements to well productivity, and that will continue to be a high priority this year for EOG.
Third, low oil prices mean unique opportunities to add low-cost, high-quality acreage. We will continue to grow our acreage portfolio through leasehold, farm-in or tactical acquisitions. We view our strong balance sheet and excess liquidity as a strategic asset for opportunities in times like these. We are already benefiting from the oil down cycle, adding new leases at lower costs than last year. And we're optimistic that additional opportunities will become available.
Finally, in my 36 years with the company I've seen many downturns, and each time EOG stays disciplined, performs well and emerges on the other side in better shape than we entered it. In 2015, EOG plans to build a stronger position and be ready to resume long-term, high return production growth when prices improve.
I will now address the Eagle Ford. David Trice will discuss the Permian Basin and Billy Helms will provide an update on the Bakken and Rockies plays along with the review of our year-end reserves. 2014 was another remarkable year in the Eagle Ford. Oil productions on the play increased 45%, and EOG achieved several key milestones.
Number one, downspacing and improved completion techniques enabled us to increase our total potential reserve estimate in 2014 by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels equivalent, net to EOG. We continue to advance our technical expertise as evidenced by ongoing improvements in productivity across the field.
Slide 17 in our updated investor presentation shows an 8% increase of productivity for wells completed in 2014 versus 2013. 
We continue our progress with high-density completions across the entire play. High-density completion is simply various techniques used to maximize the amount of rock connected to the wellbore. Due to geologies, those techniques will change from one county to the next, and we're making progress determining how to tweak those techniques across our acreage. 
Number four. After 5 years in the Eagle Ford, we're still making drilling time and cost improvements. Please see Slide 18 in the investor presentation.
And number five. At the end of 2014, our acreage in the Eagle Ford was over 80% held by production. We had a number of lease retention commitments in our Western acres that we successfully fulfilled in 2014, freeing up drilling flexibility going forward.
Eagle Ford activity in 2015 will continue to be balanced between the west and east sides of the field. As I mentioned, we are intentionally delaying completions while we wait on improved product prices. Thus, our inventory of uncompleted wells is expected to increase. This strategy allows us to maximize the value of our existing contractual commitments while waiting on improved pricing before we bring on newly completed wells with high oil production rates. Delaying completions will also provide an opportunity to take advantage of lower service costs that will likely materialize in the coming months.
The Eagle Ford remains EOG's premier play. We have about 5,500 net wells to drill on our acreage, over 10 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford represents a huge call option on oil that EOG can exercise at any time to take advantage of a favorable oil price environment. We often refer to the Eagle Ford as our technology laboratory. Our understanding of this field and how to increase its recovery rate has led to improvements in plays across the entire company. The first to benefit from this technology transfer was the Bakken beginning in late 2012. And now the Permian Basin is experiencing the latest step change in our application of technology.
I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss activities in the Permian."

In 2015, EOG's capital budget in the Permian will expand to take advantage of new Delaware Basin targets, advancements in well performance and cost reductions achieved in 2014. If you'll recall, last year we shifted capital from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin, which allowed us to advance our technical understanding of the Delaware. In 2015, we will have fewer drilling commitments to hold acreage in the Midland Basin, which frees up capital and provides more flexibility.
Let's quickly review the 2014 achievements that set this play up to be a major contributor to EOG's returns and long-term growth. First, we made significant advancements in our most mature oil play in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale, by increasing well productivity 17%. In 2015, we will continue to push wells closer together, developing and further testing down to 300 feet. We are encouraged with the initial results and expect to see further advancements throughout the year.
Second, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, we made great progress in 2014, as the play moved into development mode. We greatly increased well productivity as evidenced by the 3 wells we highlighted in our press release. At a $7 million completed well cost, the Wolfcamp play delivers very strong returns. Also in the Wolfcamp during 2014, we identified and delineated 90,000 net acres in the oil window.
Third, we tested and proved the Second Bone Spring Sand to be another high return oil target in our Delaware Basin acreage. Initial results were promising and we did extensive G&G work to delineate this play. The Second Bone Spring Sand produces 70% oil in our Red Hills acreage in New Mexico and promises returns on par with our premier oil plays. We will move the Second Bone Spring Sand into development mode this year, and it will receive the largest relative increase in capital.
 
In summary, the Leonard shale is in full development mode and continues to deliver impressive results. The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp finished its first year of development drilling. The wells are outstanding and the costs are dropping. And we are excited to add the Second Bone Spring Sand to the drilling program and bring it forward into full development mode. We are confident that we will see the same progress in the Second Bone Spring Sand that we have seen from the Leonard Shale over the last 2 years. While the Delaware Basin is still in the early innings of its exploration and development, the returns we are already generating from multiple targets make it very competitive with the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.
Billy Helms will now discuss the Bakken, the Rockies and year-end reserves."
269660,281963734,766217,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began downspacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for 20",793,"Thanks, David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began downspacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for 2014's activity.
First, we made significant advancements in improving drilling times and reducing well cost. A typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days with a completed well cost of $9.3 million. This represents a cost reduction of 11% from 2013, and we expect more efficiency gains and service cost reductions in the current environment.
Second, we now have production data from each of the various spacing patterns and can begin to determine the optimal development plan. We have tested wells at 1,300 foot, 700 foot and 500 foot spacing patterns and have just started producing wells in the 300 foot spacing pattern. Similar to the Eagle Ford, we expect that the spacing will vary depending on the specific rock characteristics in each area of the field. One of our latest tests is a 6-well pattern with wells spaced 700 feet apart in the Bakken core. Initial production rates of these wells range from 1,000 barrels of oil per day to 1,900 barrels of oil per day and represent a customized completion design tethered to the rock properties in this particular area of the field.
Third, we are confident that there is a significant amount of remaining potential in the Bakken and that downspacing will be highly economic. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the production from each spacing pattern will lead us to the appropriate spacing and the ultimate reserve potential. While the Bakken will receive less capital in 2015, it remains a core, high-return asset in our drilling program. A typical 10,000 foot lateral in the Bakken core generates greater than 35% after tax rate of return with a $55 flat oil price.
In addition, maintaining activity allows us to retain momentum on operational efficiencies. For example, we recently drilled an 18,600 foot well to total depth in just over 7 days. We continue to believe that EOG has the premier acreage position in the play with many years of development drilling remaining and the potential for long-term production growth.
In the DJ Basin, EOG made significant progress in both the Codell and Niobrara. We have been experimenting with wellbore targeting, inter-well spacing and modifications to the completion design for both intervals. For the Codell, we have identified a specific stratigraphic interval within the pay section that, when targeted, greatly enhances the performance of the well. The improved completion techniques we use are even more effective when we focus on this target. Please see our press release for some notable well results.
Like the Codell, we had tested several targets within the Niobrara. With this additional testing, we have determined the correlation between the amount of lateral focus within a specific target interval and the production performance of the well. In 2014, we made progress in several areas that contributed to reaching our well and operating cost goals in the DJ Basin. This included drilling and completion efficiencies and oil and gas gathering systems, the water gathering and distribution systems and the infrastructure needed to obtain EOG self-sourced sand.
Our activity in 2015 in the DJ Basin will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few remaining wells drilled last year.
The Powder River Basin is a stacked pay system, where we have drilled primarily in the Parkman and Turner oil reservoirs. Similar to other areas within EOG's portfolio, in 2014, we focused on well targeting, improved completion designs and inter-well spacing to determine the optimal development plan. We made significant improvements in all aspects during 2014. Please see our press release for some excellent fourth quarter well results in both the Parkman and Turner plays. We plan to have limited activity in the Powder River Basin in 2015 while we wait for commodity prices to improve. 
I'll now address reserve replacement and finding costs. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 249% of our 2014 production at a low finding cost of $13.25 per BOE. Proved reserves increased 18% and more than half of our reserve growth was driven by crude oil. In addition, net proved, developed reserves increased 20%.
For the 27th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton did an independent engineering analysis of our reserves, and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 76% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

In early December, we announced the sale of most of our producing assets in Canada for proceeds of approximately $400 million. As a result, volumes were lower than our previous guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 15 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also G&A for the quarter was higher due to $21.5 million of exit costs related to the sale.
Now I'd like to make a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter.
Capitalized interest for the quarter was $14.5 million. For the fourth quarter 2014, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $140 million. There were $66 million of acquisitions during the quarter.
For the full year 2014, capitalized interest was $57.2 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $727 million.
For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $8.3 billion. Total cash flow from operations was $8.6 billion, exceeding total cash expenditures. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $569 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $139 million.
At year-end, total debt outstanding was $5.9 million for debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%. Taking into account $2.1 billion of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total cap was 18%, down from 23% at year-end 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, total impairments were $536 million. $445 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, total impairments were $744 million. $501 million of these impairments were a result of declines in commodity prices and negotiated sales prices for property sales. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 61% and the deferred tax ratio was 104%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2015. Our 2015 CapEx estimate is $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for approximately 80% of the total CapEx budget. 2015 CapEx represents a 40% decrease from 2014. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment. The budget for exploration and development facilities accounts for approximately 12% of the total CapEx budget for 2015 and midstream accounts for 8%. We plan to concentrate our spending on infrastructure in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies.
In terms of hedges. For February 1 through June 30, 2015, we have 47,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we have 10,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $89.98 per barrel. This represents a small portion of our estimated oil production in 2015, and we will look to hedge further volumes opportunistically throughout the year. We have contracts outstanding for 37,000 barrels of oil per day that could be put to us at various terms. Please see the press release for further details.
For natural gas, we have 182,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.51 per MMBtu from March 1 through December 31, 2015. We also have a number of contracts on natural gas that could be put to us at various terms. If counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1 through December 31, 2015.
Now I'll turn it back over to Bill."

We are encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting the ban on crude oil exports.

We are encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting the ban on crude oil exports. Doing so will bring a wide range of economic and geopolitical benefits, including strengthening the U.S. energy sector, growing the U.S. economy, creating jobs, dramatically improving the U.S. trade deficit, providing our European allies with more secure supplies and lowering gasoline prices to U.S. consumers.
As I mentioned earlier, EOG will be very focused this year on preparing for the recovery in oil prices. The current supply-demand imbalance is not very large and current prices are far short of what is necessary to sustain the supply need to meet world demand growth. When prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth. For now, EOG is intentionally choosing returns over growth. In fact, that's the way it's always been here at EOG.
In summary, I want to leave you with some important summary points. Year in, year out, EOG consistently approaches capital planning by focusing on returns. 2015 is no different. Second, we have halted production growth deliberately. While EOG is one of the few companies that can earn a healthy return at today's oil prices, we are not interested in growing oil into a low price environment. As we compare today's oil prices to our expectations for a more balanced market, it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry-wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly. This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and is the right strategy to create long-term shareholder value.
Third, our balance sheet places EOG in a strong position. We intend to use our financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to grow our inventory by acquiring low-cost, high-quality acreage.
And fourth, with a substantial inventory of high-volume wells to complete, we will be ready to return to double-digit oil growth as oil prices improve.
And finally, we fully expect to emerge from this commodity price down cycle in a stronger position than we entered it. In 2015, we have more opportunity than ever to lower finding costs and development costs and improve returns in 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

So as that slows down, there should be a price response, and I'm not going to predict whether it's going to be V or U or W or really what the price is. Certainly, the forward curve is very indicative that prices will increase in the future and we're just going to wait and see how that goes and we'll respond accordingly."

Certainly, because we're deferring these completions because we do believe that prices would be better in the future. And even a $10 increase in oil price gives us a significant additional return on our investment and NPV upside. So really our rate of return focus and our capital return focus is really what's driving the deferral. And let me kind of walk you through. There's 2 parts of this deferral. One is, as Gary said, we're starting out 2015 with about 200 uncompleted wells in our inventory. And that uncompleted well inventory will grow throughout 2015. And if oil prices improve and they look something like the forward curve in the $60 range, then we would begin completing many of those wells starting in the third quarter of 2015, and that would reflect additional growth in the fourth quarter heading into 2016. So we want to head into 2016 on an uptick in production growth. So our curve in 2015 will be U shaped. It will be -- the lowest production will be in the second quarter and in the third quarter and then production will begin to increase in the fourth quarter as we head into 2016. Then at the end of the year, we'll have about 285 wells in inventory to start the 2016 process, and that will give us a bit of an advantage as we go into 2016, and we'll be able to grow oil at very strong double-digit rates and be able to stay free cash flow neutral in a $65 oil price environment. So hopefully that gives you a bit of more understanding of what we're thinking."

Our strategy this year is to remain laser-focused on returns and position EOG to resume peer-leading growth when oil prices recover. We've laid out a plan 2 months ago on our year-end call, and I'm pleased that our first quarter results are right on track. We are quickly transforming the company to be successful in this low price environment, therefore, basic objectives to our 2015 plan. Objective number one, maximize 2015 return on capital invested and position the company to resume strong growth when oil prices recover. As we discussed earlier this year, our drilling operations are focused on our top 3 plays, the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken where 85% of our 2015 capital is directed. We generated a direct after tax rate of return of 35% or greater with a flat $55 WTI oil price. And each of these plays and returns improved as a lower cost and improved well productivity. We also stated that we have no interest in accelerating oil production at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. Instead, we are drilling but deferring completions on a significant number of wells known as DUCs until oil prices improve. A $10 increase and the price of oil with a 6-month deferral adds about $300,000 of net present value to a typical well. This amounts to a significant value creation from our drilled and uncompleted well inventory. It is the right business decision to drill the wells and defer completions instead of buying out drilling contracts or growing oil at a low price environment. Now deferring completions an accelerating oil growth and a better price environment, we maximize 2015 return on capital invested and build momentum as we head into 2016. We plan to enter 2016 with approximately 285 DUCs. If oil prices recover and stabilized around $65 WTI, EOG can resume strong double-digit growth for the balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. 
Objective number two, focus on improving well productivity and operational efficiencies to position EOG to exit this downturn stronger than we entered it. There are 2 primary drivers that will improve our per well and total asset returns. The first is well productivity enhancements and the second is well cost reductions. For well productivity, we are expanding our use of high-density completions and testing down spacing to maximize MPV per section. For the next productivity game changer, we are beginning to look at ways to improve horizontal target selection. It's still early, but initial results have been promising. On the cost side, the slow down in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements. While much has been made of service cost reductions, we expect we will gain the most long-term benefits from efficiency gains. Our efforts for driving down both well cost and operating expenses, current well cost are already running at or below 2015 plan levels across all our major plays. You will hear more specific cost reduction and productivity gains in a few minutes as we discuss individual play highlights. 
Objective number three, protect our balance sheet by meeting our cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year. As result of the existing service contract commitments and projects set in motion in 2014, capital spend for this year is front-end-loaded. We outspent discretionary cash flow in the first quarter, but for the remainder of the year, we expect discretionary cash flow and CapEx to be balanced if oil price remains near recent levels. Capital discipline and the strong balance sheet are key to our long-term strategy. This allows us to manage our company through a low commodity price environment such as today's. In addition, that strength allows EOG to continue to make smart long-term rate of return driven operational decisions, such us infrastructure investments and acreage additions that will pay dividends for years to come. 
Objective number four, take advantage of opportunities during the down cycle to add acreage. We're using our exploration skills to define high-quality acreage and having good success capturing leasehold interest in emerging plays. Competition is down, acreage is available and leasing costs are low compared to previous years, and we're optimistic more opportunities will materialize as the year progresses. We're also evaluating tactical acquisition candidates. 
Now let's take a moment to discuss our production performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We're not interested in growing oil at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. While oil production did come down sequentially in the first quarter, it will slightly over the high-end of our guidance. The driver of our outperformance was primarily improved well results. Our integrated completions technology, which combines improvements in target selection and geosteering with our latest techniques and high-density completions design, is providing the next step change in our well performance. The best rocks respond best and big fields keep getting bigger. EOG's combination of sweet spot acreage and industry-leading technology enables us to continue to outperform expectations. As we described on our February call, our production profile will be U-shape this year. In the current forward ball curve continues to improve, our plan is to increase well completions in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect our oil production will return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016. We're right on track with this plan. 
Now let's turn our chance into a discussion of our 3 oil plays. I will start by discussing the Eagle Ford, then David Trice will discuss the Delaware Basin and Billy Helms will follow with a discussion of the Bakken and the Rockies plays. In the Eagle Ford this year, we are reducing drilling rigs from 23 at year-end 2014 to an average of 15. We plan to complete about 345 net wells, which is a 35% reduction in completions compared to 2014. As we reduce activity, we have a full court press to continue to reduce well costs and improve well productivity. And I'm happy to report that excellent progress in both areas is underway. Year-to-date, we have reduced total completed well cost by 10% from an industry-leading $6.1 million average well cost in 2014 to a current well cost of $5.5 million. The reduction is driven by a combination of efficiency gains and lower service costs. For 2015, increased pad drilling and fewer drilling requirements for lease retention have contributed to the efficiency gains. This year, approximately 75% of the wells will be drilled and completed on pads and over 80% of our acreage is currently held by production. At year-end, we expect to have more than 90% of our acreage held on production. We are targeting $5.3 million well cost by the end of this year which, if accomplished, would be 7% below our 2015 plan for the Eagle Ford. In addition, the cost reductions we continue to make significant improvements in our integrated completion process, which combines target selection, geosteering and high-density completion decides. Identifying the best rocks to drill the lateral, keeping the lateral in that rock longer and using the latest completion technology is making a significant difference in well productivity and decline curves. When we compare wells with high-density completions versus wells with low density completions, we see a 23% increase in cumulative oil production in the first 90 days. We also see that, that production rates are holding up longer. With this success, we plan to complete about 95% of our 2015 Eagle Ford wells with high density completion designs. With lower declines, production growth will be easier to achieve than in previous years and return on investment will continue to increase as we move forward. Finally, we're still experimenting with various techniques and spacing patterns such as using enhanced target selection methods and experimenting with W patterns within the lower Eagle Ford. We are optimistic this process will continue to increase our drilling inventory in the future. The slowdown in activity is allowing us to further evaluate this world-class asset. 
With better wells and lower costs, EOG's Eagle Ford asset is in great position to deliver strong growth and returns for many years to come. I'll now turn it over to David Trice to cover our Permian Basin activity."

If you'll recall, we increased capital spend this year in the Permian where we are still in the early innings of evaluating ultimate potential of our Delaware Basin asset. As we ramped up activity in Delaware Basin, we've made quick progress using our integrated completions process. We identified the best drilling targets within the best reservoirs while making sure we keep our laterals in these discrete intervals. This, combined with our use of advanced EOG completion techniques has resulted in dramatically improved wells. During the first quarter, we are most active in the Second Bone Spring Sand play where we are testing various targets, as well different well spacing patterns. Microseismic data we have gathered throughout the play indicates good fracture containment within the individual Second Bone Spring Sand targets. For example, we drilled 3 wells in Lea County, New Mexico on the Jelly Roger 16 state lease. The wells tested 3 different Second Bone Spring Sand targets at 600-foot well spacing. All 3 target server productive with IP rates ranging from 1,030 to 1,315 barrels of oil per day. And the technical data we collected does not indicate any production sharing between these wells. Going forward, we will continue to push the spacing limits and test new targets. Another notable Second Bone Spring Sand well we brought on in the first quarter was the Brownbear 36 State #502H which IP-ed at a rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We're very pleased with these results and expect our individual well performance and recoveries to continue to improve as we refine our drilling targets and implement high-density completions. 
In addition to impressive well results, we are pushing down costs. Our current well costs is $6 million which is down 22% from 2014. We expect this trend to continue and have a target cost of $5.7 million by year-end. The overpressure oil window in the Wolfcamp continues to deliver excellent results in record time. The Brownbear 36 State #701H was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico and came on at 2,165 barrels of oil per day. We're planning to increase our activity in this play throughout the remainder of the year, and we are confident we can achieve increased well performance and lower cost as we move toward development mode. 
In the Leonard Shale we completed a 300-foot spaced 4 well pattern during the first quarter. The Excelsior 12 #3H, 4H, 5H and 6H were brought online producing from 955 to 1,165 barrels of oil per day. The Leonard Shale is the most mature of our current plays in the Delaware Basin. The well economics continue to improve as we tighten spacing and lower cost. In fact, much like the Western Eagle Ford, we make better returns at $65 oil now than we could in 2012 at $95 oil. We're optimistic similar trends will emerge in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand in the coming years. Even as EOG increases activity in the Delaware Basin, the overall industry slowdown is helping us lower bulk cost, add additional acreage and optimize long-term infrastructure needs such water handling and takeaway capacity. 
We're very excited about the potential of the Delaware Basin and its key role in EOG's future growth. Billy Helms will now discuss the Rockies plays."

As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River basin.

As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River basin. Each of these are well-established plays with significant remaining potential, and all our benefiting greatly from the pullback in activity. Plans are in place and steady progress is being made in lowering costs in each space of our operations. 
In the Bakken, the slowdown in activity is allowing us to focus on 3 things. First, we have made tremendous progress on operational efficiencies and lowering well cost. Our typical 10,000-foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days, and the well cost is currently 14% less than the 2014 well cost. We anticipate this year's well cost will be as much as 20% below 2014 levels with a target of $7.4 million. Second, we're using new technical data from our integrated completions process to further adjust and tailor our high-density completions zones to specific formation properties. Understanding and using this data gives us insight into how to adjust the completion along the lateral to effectively optimize each stage. These modifications are leading to improved results. And third, we're able to maintain a more stable production base with minimal downtime associated with offset completion interference. This allows us to better evaluate the production from various spacing patterns to determine our ultimate development plan. In the first quarter, we began producing 8 wells in 2 500-foot space patterns in the Partial area. Initial per well production rates from a 5-well pattern averaged 1,235 barrels of oil per day and a 3-well pattern average 1,345 barrels of oil per day. We are encouraged by the results from these downspacing patterns and our confident in our ability to maximizing recovery and ultimately net present value of this asset. 
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our targeting in the Codell and experiment with modified completion designs. Recent examples of improved targeting in completions are 2 Jubilee wells that each had initial production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Further, 2015 activity in the DJ will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few wells. In the Powder River Basin, activity will be focused on delineation and target selection of this profitable stacked resource play. The Turner formation is one of the stacked play integrals and continues to generate good results as evidenced by the recently completed Blackbow 13-13H with an IP of 860 barrels of oil per day. 
Our commitment to the long-term profitability of our Rockies plays is emphasized by additional infrastructure capital being invested that could reduce our future well cost by $300,000 to $500,000 per well. These investments include building more pipelines to move water to all sites and adding water had been infrastructure by recycling disposal. As a result, we will not only reduce upfront capital but also reduce long-term LOE. These investments will decrease our need for trucking services and also help our communities by reducing truck traffic.

Total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $117 million. Drilling activity is expected to decline in the second quarter and flatten out, and we have maintained our full year capital expenditure guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. 
At the end of March 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.9 billion and the debt to total cap ratio was  28%. At March 31, we had $2.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.8 billion [ph] or net debt to total cap ratio of 21%.

We continue to believe that current oil prices will discourage oil exploration and development worldwide and will encourage demand growth. This will correct the current oversupply situation and the market will continue to rebalance. We believe there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. 
In summary, here are some important points to take away from this call. First, EOG remains disciplined. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. We do not plan to increase 2015 CapEx and, at recent oil prices, our CapEx to discretionary cash flow will be balanced for the remainder of the year. Second, the company's priority remains squarely focused on returns. We have directed 2015 capital to our highest oil return plays which generate 35% or better after tax rates of return at $55 WTI price environment. Returns are improving on each of these assets as we go forward. Well costs are going down and well productivity is going up. Even as oil prices have retreated, our direct rates of return are improving and EOG would be more than competitive in the world markets as we go forward. Third, we continue to organically grow reserve potential in our existing plays through down spacing and completion enhancements. We believe the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken will continue to grow in drilling potential. We're also optimistic that we will find new potential through our exploration efforts. As we test and confirm meaningful results, we will update you with new potential reserve estimates in the future. Fourth, we said all along that we're preparing to return to growth in 2016 when oil prices improve. If we have $65 WTI price environment in 2016, we can resume our strong double digit oil growth profile with a balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. And, finally, EOG is in this business for the long-term. We've not made short-term decisions this year that would hinder our future growth. This year, we are even more committed to advancements in technology, exploration, cost reduction and operational execution. The company is building on the culture that has set EOG apart and resetting the bar to be successful in a lower commodity price environment.

The reason we deferred the completions is to really substantially increase the rate of return. So as we go forward this year, it's really important for us to be patient and allow the process to continue to firm up. And as I've said, the first $10 in oil price increase with a 6-month deferral is a $300,000 net TV ad to a typical well. So we want to make sure that we allow process to firm up and that the process will continue to be firm and not short term. And then on a -- as you see, we're hitting significant cost-reduction as we go forward. We're gaining on that everyday and we're gaining on well productivity as we go forward. So we don't want to get in a hurry. We want to stay disciplined. We certainly don't want to jumpstart completions and the price may be fallback. So if the forward curve continues to stay firm, then our plan, as we said, is to begin completing wells in the third quarter. And we really look at what the outlook on 2016 prices are, that's what we're targeting and that's what we're really focusing on. So we'll just continue to watch the fundamentals and certainly we want to be committed  that they're strong going forward.

The stronger the price of oil is, the more, obviously, capital we'll have to work with and the more will continue to increase our activity. As we look at the second part of this year, part of the process will be evaluating how many drilling rigs to continue to have drilling wells versus releasing rigs and that certainly will be a function of what the oil price is and so we won't get too far out in front on the drilling side.

Of course, the full corporate returns ROCE are all capital and all capital spend from the history of the company. And so you got legacy gas properties in there and lots of other things in there over time. And that's the real difference  in the thing. As everybody has noted over the last several years, EOG's ROCE numbers have continued to improve rather strongly and over the last year, ROCE numbers were higher certainly than the E&P parent group, and they were even higher than the average of the integrateds and the majors. So we have one of the strongest track records and one of the strongest ROCEs in the business, and that just reflects EOG's continued focus on returns. Rates of return on our capital drives every decision in EOG and it is the fundamental metric that we use to manage the company. So as we talk about this year, we're deferring wells, that's really just to drive up the returns on our capital and all the things we're doing to decrease well costs and increase productivity are very, very focused on driving up the returns for the company as we go forward.

We laid out a plan 2 months ago on our year-end call, and I'm pleased that our first qu",1379,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Our strategy this year is to remain laser-focused on returns and position EOG to resume peer-leading oil growth when oil prices recover. We laid out a plan 2 months ago on our year-end call, and I'm pleased that our first quarter results are right on track. We are quickly transforming the company to be successful in this low price environment, therefore, basic objectives to our 2015 plan. Objective number one, maximize 2015 return on capital invested and position the company to resume strong growth when oil prices recover. As we discussed earlier this year, our drilling operations are focused on our top 3 plays, the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken where 85% of our 2015 capital is directed. We generate a direct after tax rate of return of 35% or greater with a flat $55 WTI oil price in each of these plays, and returns improved as a lower cost and improved well productivity. We've also stated that we have no interest in accelerating oil production at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. Instead, we are drilling but deferring completions on a significant number of wells known as DUCs until oil prices improve. A $10 increase in the price of oil with a 6-month deferral adds about $300,000 of net present value to a typical well. This amounts to a significant value creation from our drilled but uncompleted well inventory. It is the right business decision to drill the wells and defer completions instead of buying out drilling contracts or growing oil in a low price environment. Now deferring completions and accelerating oil growth in a better price environment, we maximize 2015 return on capital invested and build momentum as we head into 2016. We plan to enter 2016 with approximately 285 DUCs. If oil prices recover and stabilize around $65 WTI, EOG can resume strong double-digit growth for the balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. 
Objective number two, focus on improving well productivity and operational efficiencies to position EOG to exit this downturn stronger than we entered it. There are 2 primary drivers that will improve our per well and total asset returns. The first is well productivity enhancements and the second is well cost reductions. For well productivity, we are expanding our use of high-density completions and testing down spacing to maximize NPV per section. For the next productivity game changer, we are beginning to look at ways to improve horizontal target selection. It's still early, but initial results have been promising. On the cost side, the slow down in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements. While much has been made of service cost reductions, we expect we will gain the most long-term benefits from efficiency gains. Our efforts are driving down both well cost and operating expenses. Current well cost are already running at or below 2015 plan levels across all our major plays. You will hear more specifics on cost reduction and productivity gains in a few minutes as we discuss individual play highlights. 
Objective number three, protect our balance sheet by meeting our cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year. As a result of the existing service contract commitments and projects set in motion in 2014, capital spend for this year is front-end loaded. We outspent discretionary cash flow in the first quarter, but for the remainder of the year, we expect discretionary cash flow and CapEx to be balanced if oil price remains near recent levels. Capital discipline and a strong balance sheet are key to our long-term strategy. This allows us to manage our company through a low commodity price environment such as today's. In addition, that strength allows EOG to continue to make smart long-term rate of return driven operational decisions, such as infrastructure investments and acreage additions that will pay dividends for years to come. 
Objective number four, take advantage of opportunities during the down cycle to add acreage. We're using our exploration skills to define high-quality acreage and are having good success capturing leasehold interest in emerging plays. Competition is down, acreage is available and leasing costs are low compared to previous years, and we're optimistic more opportunities will materialize as the year progresses. We're also evaluating tactical acquisition candidates. 
Now let's take a moment to discuss our production performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We're not interested in growing oil at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. While oil production did come down sequentially in the first quarter, it will slightly over the high end of our guidance. The driver of our outperformance was primarily improved well results. Our integrated completions technology, which combines improvements in target selection and geosteering with our latest techniques and high-density completion design, is providing the next step change in our well performance. The best rocks respond best and big fields keep getting bigger. EOG's combination of sweet spot acreage and industry-leading technology enables us to continue to outperform expectations. As we described on our February call, our production profile will be U-shaped this year. If the current forward oil curve continues to improve, our plan is to increase well completions in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect our oil productions to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016. We're right on track with this plan. 
Now let's turn our attention to a discussion of our 3 high return oil plays. I will start by discussing the Eagle Ford, then David Trice will discuss the Delaware Basin and Billy Helms will follow with a discussion of the Bakken and the Rockies plays. In the Eagle Ford this year, we are reducing drilling rigs from 23 at year-end 2014 to an average of 15. We plan to complete about 345 net wells, which is a 35% reduction in completions compared to 2014. As we reduce activity, we have a full court press to continue to reduce well costs and improve well productivity. And I'm happy to report that excellent progress in both areas is underway. Year-to-date, we have reduced total completed well cost by 10% from an industry-leading $6.1 million average well cost in 2014 to a current well cost of $5.5 million. The reduction is driven by a combination of efficiency gains and lower service costs. For 2015, increased pad drilling and fewer drilling requirements for lease retention have contributed to the efficiency gains. This year, approximately 75% of the wells will be drilled and completed on pads and over 80% of our acreage is currently held by production. At year end, we expect to have more than 90% of our acreage held by production. We are targeting $5.3 million well cost by the end of this year which, if accomplished, would be 7% below our 2015 plan for the Eagle Ford. In addition to cost reductions, we continue to make significant improvements in our integrated completion process, which combines target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. Identifying the best rocks to drill the lateral, keeping the lateral in that rock longer and using the latest completion technology is making a significant difference in well productivity and decline curves. When we compare wells with high-density completions versus wells with low density completions, we see a 23% increase in cumulative oil production in the first 90 days. We also see that, that production rates are holding up longer. With this success, we plan to complete about 95% of our 2015 Eagle Ford wells with high density completion designs. With lower declines, production growth will be easier to achieve than in previous years and return on investment will continue to increase as we move forward. Finally, we're still experimenting with various techniques and spacing patterns such as using enhanced target selection methods and experimenting with W patterns within the lower Eagle Ford. We are optimistic this process will continue to increase our drilling inventory in the future. The slowdown in activity is allowing us to further evaluate this world-class asset. 
With better wells and lower costs, EOG's Eagle Ford asset is in great position to deliver strong growth and returns for many years to come. I'll now turn it over to David Trice to cover our Permian Basin activity."

If you'll recall, we increased capital spend this year in the Permian where we are still in the early innings of evaluating the ultimate potential of our Delaware Basin asset. As we ramped up activity in Delaware Basin, we've made quick progress using our integrated completions process. We identified the best drilling targets within the best reservoirs while making sure we keep our laterals in these discrete intervals. This, combined with our use of advanced EOG completion techniques, has resulted in dramatically improved wells. During the first quarter, we were most active in the Second Bone Spring Sand play where we are testing various targets as well as different well spacing patterns. Microseismic data we have gathered throughout the play indicates good fracture containment within the individual Second Bone Spring Sand targets. For example, we drilled 3 wells in Lea County, New Mexico on the Jolly Roger 16 State lease. The wells tested 3 different Second Bone Spring Sand targets at 600-foot well spacing. All 3 targets are very productive with IP rates ranging from 1,030 to 1,315 barrels of oil per day. And the technical data we collected does not indicate any production sharing between these wells. Going forward, we will continue to push the spacing limits and test new targets. Another notable Second Bone Spring Sand well we brought on in the first quarter was the Brown Bear 36 State #502H which IP-ed at a rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We are very pleased with these results and expect our individual well performance and recoveries to continue to improve as we refine our drilling targets and implement high-density completions. 
In addition to impressive well results, we are pushing down costs. Our current well costs is $6 million which is down 22% from 2014. We expect this trend to continue and have a target cost of $5.7 million by year end. The overpressure oil window in the Wolfcamp continues to deliver excellent results in record term. The Brown Bear 36 State #701H was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico and came on at 2,165 barrels of oil per day. We're planning to increase our activity in this play throughout the remainder of the year, and we are confident we can achieve increased well performance and lower cost as we move toward development mode. 
In the Leonard Shale, we completed a 300-foot spaced 4-well pattern during the first quarter. The Excelsior 12 #3H, 4H, 5H and 6H were brought online producing from 955 to 1,165 barrels of oil per day. The Leonard Shale is the most mature of our current plays in the Delaware Basin. The well economics continue to improve as we tighten spacing and lower cost. In fact, much like the western Eagle Ford, we make better returns at $65 oil now than we could in 2012 at $95 oil. We are optimistic similar trends will emerge in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand in the coming years. Even as EOG increases activity in the Delaware Basin, the overall industry slowdown is helping us lower well cost, add additional acreage and optimize long-term infrastructure needs such water handling and takeaway capacity. 
We are very excited about the potential of the Delaware Basin and its key role in EOG's future growth. Billy Helms will now discuss the Rockies plays."

As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin.

As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin. Each of these are well-established plays with significant remaining potential, and now all are benefiting greatly from the pullback in activity. Plans are in place and steady progress is being made in lowering costs in each space of our operations. 
In the Bakken, the slowdown in activity is allowing us to focus on 3 things. First, we have made tremendous progress on operational efficiencies and lowering well cost. Our typical 10,000-foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days, and the well cost is currently 14% less than the 2014 well cost. We anticipate this year's well cost will be as much as 20% below 2014 levels with a target of $7.4 million. Second, we're using new technical data from our integrated completions process to further adjust and tailor our high-density completion zones to specific formation properties. Understanding and using this data gives us insight into how to adjust the completion along the lateral to effectively optimize each stage. These modifications are leading to improved results. And third, we're able to maintain a more stable production base with minimal downtime associated with offset completion interference. This allows us to better evaluate the production from various spacing patterns to determine our ultimate development plan. In the first quarter, we began producing 8 wells in 2 500-foot space patterns in the Parshall area. Initial per well production rates from a 5-well pattern averaged 1,235 barrels of oil per day and a 3-well pattern averaged 1,345 barrels of oil per day. We are encouraged by the results from these downspacing patterns and are confident in our ability to maximize the recovery and ultimately the net present value of this asset. 
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our targeting in the Codell and experiment with modified completion designs. Recent examples of improved targeting completions are 2 Jubilee wells that each had initial production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Further 2015 activity in the DJ will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few wells. In the Powder River Basin, activity will be focused on delineation and target selection of this profitable stacked resource play. The Turner formation is one of the stacked pay intervals and continues to generate good results as evidenced by the recently completed Flatbow 13-13H with an IP of 860 barrels of oil per day. 
Our commitment to the long-term profitability of our Rockies plays is emphasized by the additional infrastructure capital being invested that could reduce our future well cost by $300,000 to $500,000 per well. These investments include building more pipelines to move water to well sites and adding water handling infrastructure for recycling and disposal. As a result, we will not only reduce upfront capital but also reduce long-term LOE. These investments will decrease our need for trucking services and also help our communities by reducing truck traffic. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $117 million. Drilling activity is expected to decline in the second quarter and flatten out, and we have maintained our full year capital expenditure guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. 
At the end of March 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.9 billion and the debt-to-total cap ratio was 28%. At March 31, we had $2.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.8 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 21%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28% and the current tax expense was $31 million.

We continue to believe that current oil prices will discourage oil exploration and development worldwide and will encourage demand growth. This will correct the current oversupply situation and the market will continue to rebalance. We believe there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. 
In summary, here are some important points to take away from this call. First, EOG remains disciplined. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. We do not plan to increase 2015 CapEx and at recent oil prices, our CapEx to discretionary cash flow will be balanced for the remainder of the year. Second, the company's priority remains squarely focused on returns. We have directed 2015 capital to our highest oil return plays which generate 35% or better after tax rates of return at $55 WTI price environment. Returns are improving on each of these assets as we go forward. Well costs are going down and well productivity is going up. Even as oil prices have retreated, our direct rates of return are improving and EOG will be more than competitive in the world markets as we go forward. Third, we continue to organically grow reserve potential in our existing plays through down spacing and completion enhancements. We believe the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken will continue to grow in drilling potential. We're also optimistic that we will find new potential through our exploration efforts. As we test and confirm meaningful results, we will update you with new potential reserve estimates in the future. Fourth, we've said all along that we're preparing to return to growth in 2016 when oil prices improve. If we have $65 WTI price environment in 2016, we can resume our strong double digit oil growth profile with a balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. And finally, EOG is in this business for the long term. We've not made short-term decisions this year that would hinder our future growth. This year, we are even more committed to advancements in technology, exploration, cost reduction and operational execution. The company is building on the culture that has set EOG apart and resetting the bar to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. As we look to the future, we fully expect to remain the North America growth leader and the peer leader in returns on capital employed.

And as I've said, every -- the first $10 in oil price increase with a 6-month deferral is a $300,000 net PV add to a typical well. So we want to make sure that we allow process to firm up and that the process will continue to be firm and not short term. And then on a -- we're -- as you see, we're hitting significant cost reduction as we go forward. We're gaining on that everyday and we're gaining on well productivity as we go forward. So we don't want to get in a hurry. We want to stay disciplined. We certainly don't want to jumpstart completions and the price may be a fallback. So if the forward curve continues to stay firm, then our plan, as we said, is to begin completing wells in the third quarter. And we really look at what the outlook on 2016 prices are, that's what we're targeting and that's what we're really focusing on. So we'll just continue to watch the fundamentals and certainly we want to be convinced that they're strong going forward.

We laid out a plan 2 months ago on our year-end call, and I'm pleased that our first qu",1379,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Our strategy this year is to remain laser-focused on returns and position EOG to resume peer-leading oil growth when oil prices recover. We laid out a plan 2 months ago on our year-end call, and I'm pleased that our first quarter results are right on track. We are quickly transforming the company to be successful in this low price environment. 
There are 4 basic objectives to our 2015 plan: Objective number one, maximize 2015 return on capital invested and position the company to resume strong growth when oil prices recover. As we discussed earlier this year, our drilling operations are focused on our top 3 plays, the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken where 85% of our 2015 capital is directed. We generate a direct after tax rate of return of 35% or greater with a flat $55 WTI oil price in each of these plays, and returns improve as a lower cost and improve well productivity. 
We've also stated that we have no interest in accelerating oil production at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. Instead, we are drilling but deferring completions on a significant number of wells known as DUCs until oil prices improve. A $10 increase in the price of oil with a 6-month deferral adds about $300,000 of net present value to a typical well. This amounts to a significant value creation from our drilled but uncompleted well inventory. It is the right business decision to drill the wells and defer completions instead of buying out drilling contracts or growing oil in a low price environment. 
By deferring completions and accelerating oil growth in a better price environment, we maximize 2015 return on capital invested and build momentum as we head into 2016. We plan to enter 2016 with approximately 285 DUCs. If oil prices recover and stabilize around $65 WTI, EOG can resume strong double-digit growth for the balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. 
Objective number two, focus on improving well productivity and operational efficiencies to position EOG to exit this downturn stronger than we entered it. There are 2 primary drivers that will improve our per well and total asset returns. The first is well productivity enhancements and the second is well cost reductions. For well productivity, we are expanding our use of high-density completions and testing down spacing to maximize NPV per section. For the next productivity game changer, we are beginning to look at ways to improve horizontal target selection. It's still early, but initial results have been promising. 
On the cost side, the slowdown in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements. While much has been made of service cost reductions, we expect we will gain the most long-term benefits from efficiency gains. Our efforts are driving down both well cost and operating expenses. Current well cost are already running at or below 2015 plan levels across all our major plays. You will hear more specifics on cost reduction and productivity gains in a few minutes as we discuss individual play highlights. 
Objective number three, protect our balance sheet by meeting our cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year. As a result of the existing service contract commitments and projects set in motion in 2014, capital spend for this year is front-end loaded. We outspent discretionary cash flow in the first quarter, but for the remainder of the year, we expect discretionary cash flow and CapEx to be balanced if oil price remains near recent levels. Capital discipline and a strong balance sheet are key to our long-term strategy. This allows us to manage our company through a low commodity price environment such as today's. In addition, that strength allows EOG to continue to make smart long-term rate of return driven operational decisions, such as infrastructure investments and acreage additions that will pay dividends for years to come. 
Objective number four, take advantage of opportunities during the down cycle to add acreage. We're using our exploration skills to define high-quality acreage and are having good success capturing leasehold interest in emerging plays. Competition is down, acreage is available and leasing costs are low compared to previous years, and we're optimistic more opportunities will materialize as the year progresses. We're also evaluating tactical acquisition candidates. 
Now let's take a moment to discuss our production performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We're not interested in growing oil at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. While oil production did come down sequentially in the first quarter, it will slightly over the high end of our guidance. The driver of our outperformance was primarily improved well results. Our integrated completions technology, which combines improvements in target selection and geosteering with our latest techniques and high-density completion design, is providing the next step change in our well performance. The best rocks respond best and big fields keep getting bigger. EOG's combination of sweet spot acreage and industry-leading technology enables us to continue to outperform expectations. As we described on our February call, our production profile will be U-shaped this year. If the current forward oil curve continues to improve, our plan is to increase well completions in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect our oil productions to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016. We're right on track with this plan. 
Now let's turn our attention to a discussion of our 3 high return oil plays. I will start by discussing the Eagle Ford, then David Trice will discuss the Delaware Basin and Billy Helms will follow with a discussion of the Bakken and the Rockies plays. In the Eagle Ford this year, we are reducing drilling rigs from 23 at year-end 2014 to an average of 15. We plan to complete about 345 net wells, which is a 35% reduction in completions compared to 2014. As we reduce activity, we have a full court press to continue to reduce well costs and improve well productivity. And I'm happy to report that excellent progress in both areas is underway. 
Year-to-date, we have reduced total completed well cost by 10% from an industry-leading $6.1 million average well cost in 2014 to our current well cost of $5.5 million. The reduction is driven by a combination of efficiency gains and lower service costs. For 2015, increased pad drilling and fewer drilling requirements for lease retention have contributed to the efficiency gains. This year, approximately 75% of the wells will be drilled and completed on pads and over 80% of our acreage is currently held by production. 
By year end, we expect to have more than 90% of our acreage held by production. We are targeting $5.3 million well cost by the end of this year which, if accomplished, would be 7% below our 2015 plan for the Eagle Ford. In addition to cost reductions, we continue to make significant improvements in our integrated completion process, which combines target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. Identifying the best rocks to drill the lateral, keeping the lateral in that rock longer and using the latest completion technology is making a significant difference in well productivity and decline curves. 
When we compare wells with high-density completions versus wells with low density completions, we see a 23% increase in cumulative oil production in the first 90 days. We also see that at-production rates are holding up longer. With this success, we plan to complete about 95% of our 2015 Eagle Ford wells with high density completion designs. With lower declines, production growth will be easier to achieve than in previous years and return on investment will continue to increase as we move forward. Finally, we're still experimenting with various techniques and spacing patterns such as using enhanced target selection methods and experimenting with W patterns within the lower Eagle Ford. We are optimistic this process will continue to increase our drilling inventory in the future. This slowdown in activity is allowing us to further evaluate this world-class asset. 
With better wells and lower costs, EOG's Eagle Ford asset is in great position to deliver strong growth and returns for many years to come. I'll now turn it over to David Trice to cover our Permian Basin activity."

If you'll recall, we increased capital spend this year in the Permian where we are still in the early innings of evaluating the ultimate potential of our Delaware Basin asset. As we ramped up activity in Delaware Basin, we've made quick progress using our integrated completions process. We identified the best drilling targets within the best reservoirs while making sure we keep our laterals in these discrete intervals. This, combined with our use of advanced EOG completion techniques, has resulted in dramatically improved wells. 
During the first quarter, we were most active in the Second Bone Spring Sand play where we are testing various targets as well as different well spacing patterns. Microseismic data we have gathered throughout the play indicates good fracture containment within the individual Second Bone Spring Sand targets. For example, we drilled 3 wells in Lea County, New Mexico on the Jolly Roger 16 State lease. The wells tested 3 different Second Bone Spring Sand targets at 600-foot well spacing. All 3 targets are very productive with IP rates ranging from 1,030 to 1,315 barrels of oil per day. And the technical data we collected does not indicate any production sharing between these wells.
Going forward, we will continue to push the spacing limits and test new targets. Another notable Second Bone Spring Sand well we brought on in the first quarter was the Brown Bear 36 State #502H which IP-ed at a rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We are very pleased with these results and expect our individual well performance and recoveries to continue to improve as we refine our drilling targets and implement high-density completions. 
In addition to impressive well results, we are pushing down costs. Our current well costs is $6 million which is down 22% from 2014. We expect this trend to continue and have a target cost of $5.7 million by yearend. The overpressure oil window in the Wolfcamp continues to deliver excellent results in record term. The Brown Bear 36 State #701H was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico and came on at 2,165 barrels of oil per day. We're planning to increase our activity in this play throughout the remainder of the year, and we are confident we can achieve increased well performance and lower cost as we move toward development mode. 
In the Leonard Shale, we completed a 300-foot spaced 4-well pattern during the first quarter. The Excelsior 12 #3H, 4H, 5H and 6H were brought online producing from 955 to 1,165 barrels of oil per day. The Leonard Shale is the most mature of our current plays in the Delaware Basin. The well economics continue to improve as we tighten spacing and lower cost. In fact, much like the western Eagle Ford, we make better returns at $65 oil now than we could in 2012 at $95 oil. We are optimistic similar trends will emerge in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand in the coming years. Even as EOG increases activity in the Delaware Basin, the overall industry slowdown is helping us lower well cost, add additional acreage and optimize long-term infrastructure needs such water handling and takeaway capacity. 
We are very excited about the potential of the Delaware Basin and its key role in EOG's future growth. Billy Helms will now discuss the Rockies plays."
269660,290174860,804513,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin.

As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin. Each of these are well-established plays with significant remaining potential, and all are benefiting greatly from the pullback in activity. Plans are in place and steady progress is being made in lowering costs in each phase of our operations. 
In the Bakken, the slowdown in activity is allowing us to focus on 3 things. First, we have made tremendous progress on operational efficiencies and lowering well cost. Our typical 10,000-foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days, and the well cost is currently 14% less than the 2014 well cost. We anticipate this year's well cost will be as much as 20% below 2014 levels with a target of $7.4 million. Second, we're using new technical data from our integrated completions process to further adjust and tailor our high-density completion zones to specific formation properties. Understanding and using this data gives us insight into how to adjust the completion along the lateral to effectively optimize each stage. These modifications are leading to improved results. And third, we're able to maintain a more stable production base with minimal downtime associated with offset completion interference. This allows us to better evaluate the production from various spacing patterns to determine our ultimate development plan. 
In the first quarter, we began producing 8 wells in 2 500-foot space patterns in the Parshall area. Initial per well production rates from a 5-well pattern averaged 1,235 barrels of oil per day and a 3-well pattern averaged 1,345 barrels of oil per day. We are encouraged by the results from these downspacing patterns and are confident in our ability to maximize the recovery and ultimately the net present value of this asset. 
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our targeting in the Codell and experiment with modified [ph] completion designs. Recent examples of improved targeting completions are 2 Jubilee wells that each had initial production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Further 2015 activity in the DJ will be limited to drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few wells. 
In the Powder River Basin, activity will be focused on delineation and target selection of this profitable stacked resource play. The Turner formation is one of the stacked pay intervals and continues to generate good results as evidenced by the recently completed Flatbow 13-13H with an IP of 860 barrels of oil per day. 
Our commitment to the long-term profitability of our Rockies plays is emphasized by the additional infrastructure capital being invested that could reduce our future well cost by $300,000 to $500,000 per well. These investments include building more pipelines to move water to well sites and adding water handling infrastructure for recycling and disposal. As a result, we will not only reduce upfront capital but also reduce long-term LOE. These investments will decrease our need for trucking services and also help our communities by reducing truck traffic. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $117 million. Drilling activity is expected to decline in the second quarter and flatten out, and we have maintained our full year capital expenditure guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. 
At the end of March 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.9 billion and the debt-to-total cap ratio was 28%. At March 31, we had $2.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.8 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 21%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28% and the current tax expense was $31 million. 
For the period May 1 through June 30, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 47,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $91.22 per barrel. For the period July 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel.

We continue to believe that current oil prices will discourage oil exploration and development worldwide and will encourage demand growth. This will correct the current oversupply situation and the market will continue to rebalance. We believe there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. 
In summary, here are some important points to take away from this call. First, EOG remains disciplined. We're committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. We do not plan to increase 2015 CapEx and at recent oil prices, our CapEx to discretionary cash flow will be balanced for the remainder of the year. Second, the company's priority remains squarely focused on returns. We have directed 2015 capital to our highest oil return plays which generate 35% or better after tax rates of return at $55 WTI price environment. Returns are improving on each of these assets as we go forward. Well costs are going down and well productivity is going up. Even as oil prices have retreated, our direct rates of return are improving and EOG will be more than competitive in the world markets as we go forward. 
Third, we continue to organically grow reserve potential in our existing plays through down spacing and completion enhancements. We believe the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken will continue to grow in drilling potential. We're also optimistic that we will find new potential through our exploration efforts. As we test and confirm meaningful results, we will update you with new potential reserve estimates in the future. Fourth, we've said all along that we're preparing to return to growth in 2016 when oil prices improve. If we have $65 WTI price environment in 2016, we can resume our strong double digit oil growth profile with a balanced CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. 
And finally, EOG is in this business for the long term. We've not made short-term decisions this year that would hinder our future growth. This year, we are even more committed to advancements in technology, exploration, cost reduction and operational execution. The company is building on the culture that has set EOG apart and resetting the bar to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. As we look to the future, we fully expect to remain the North America growth leader and the peer leader in returns on capital employed.

So we want to make sure that we allow prices to firm up and that the prices will continue to be firm and not short term. And then on a -- we're -- as you see, we're hitting significant cost reduction as we go forward. We're gaining on that every day and we're gaining on well productivity as we go forward. So we don't want to get in a hurry. We want to stay disciplined. We certainly don't want to jumpstart completions and the price maybe fallback.

Of course, the goal is and the plan is to continue to remain CapEx to discretionary cash flow balanced. And so that will really govern our activity. The stronger the price of oil is, the more, obviously, capital we'll have to work with and the more we'll continue to increase our activity. As we look at the second part of this year, part of the process we'll be evaluating is how many drilling rigs to continue to have drilling wells versus releasing rigs. And that certainly will be a function of what the oil price is. And so we won't get too far out in front on the drilling side.

And so he's got legacy gas properties in there and lots of other things in there over time. And that's the real difference in the thing. As everybody has noted over the last several years, EOG's ROCE numbers have continued to improve rather strongly and over the last year, our ROCE numbers were higher certainly than the E&P peer group, and they were even higher than the average of the integrateds and the majors. So we have one of the strongest track records and one of the strongest ROCEs in the business, and that just reflects EOG's continued focus on returns. Rates of return on our capital drives every decision in EOG and it is the fundamental metric that we use to manage the company. So as we talked about this year, we're deferring wells, that's really just to drive up the returns on our capital and all the things we're doing to decrease well costs and increase productivity are very, very focused on driving up the returns for the company as we go forward.

We just think that the upside on the completion will be much greater than if you tried to refrac the well. Then the other thing, obviously, that contributes to that is that the well costs on the drilling side, as we can see, are just getting lower and lower and becoming a smaller percentage of the total well costs. So drilling a new well from the drilling side standpoint is just a pretty low cost item today, and there's a lot more upside in just redrilling the well and doing it right."

269660,306412228,852384,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

We're pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion processing the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1,500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent that remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. In addition to the updated resource estimates, we split the Bakken into 2 categories that we have titled Core Acreage And Non-Core Acreage. The core produces returns that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope Extension. Non-core represents acreage in the Bakken Light State Line and areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area, we believe that with modern high density completions and current well costs, the non-core acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. 
We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Non-core acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage, we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 [ph] net drilling locations, which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102 32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope Extension we have drilled using a high density completion. The well came on online with a maximum rate of 3,395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, with an average rate of 2,760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4,300-foot lateral will be the highest rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. 
In addition to improve returns to advance completion, we've made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well costs, which are now $7.1 million for an 8,400-foot tree lateral. This is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions and therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days spread the TV for an 8,400-foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently, we are averaging more than 10 completion status per day, up from 4 to 5 status per day in 2014. In addition, plug drill out times have been cut in half since 2014. Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result, we have seen dramatic LOE reproductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential and drilling inventory, illustrates the value of EOG's exploration and technology leadership. We interplay as the first mover and capture the best assets, then we grow them to the drillbit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. 
Here's Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford."

The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well cost. In the case of improved productivity, we are finding that wellbore targeting along with our integrated completion approach continues to provide upside on well performance. 
In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the Second Bone Spring Sand, testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State #501H and 502H were completed in a 1,000-foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1,075 and 1,755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com #501H tested 1,705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The completed well costs for the Second Bone Spring Sand are currently averaging $6 million per well, representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance, coupled with lower well cost, make this play very attractive in this lower commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. 
During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the over pressured, oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County, New Mexico, the Dragon 36 States #701H and the Hern's 27 State Comp #703H had initial production rates per well of 2,650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various target and spacing patterns, this play promises to be a higher return growth asset for EOG. 
Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now costs $5.5 million and we are testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells, 1 recent completion in Lee County, New Mexico, the Jim 36 State Comp #1H had an initial production rate of 2,200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. 
Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOG's long-term growth. As typical with our other place, EOG is -- will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating costs to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOG's Delaware Basin properties. 
Now moving to the Eagle Ford, which continues to be our work course asset. Due to the sheer scale of our operations there, it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled 4 pilot wells together with additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific targets variability across the play. We are currently conducting tests using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford and the new data we gathered on the targets is encouraging, as it supports our expectations for success. 
While it's too early to share results, we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress that cost-reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance through the application of technology, is ensuring that this world class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come.

So our model shows, by what everybody is guiding, that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the 1.2 million barrels a day, last year, so there's a significant drop off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the -- if prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month over month decline rates in the U.S. and that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OpEx [ph] supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly, that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market. The other thing is certainly is that we just can't see a good business reason to outspend growing oil in an oversupplied oil market. That does not make sense to us, so we believe we made the right decision."

269660,306412228,852735,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. T",596,"Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1,500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent that have remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. 
In addition to the updated resource estimates, we split the Bakken into 2 categories that we have titled core acreage and noncore acreage. The core produces returns that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope Extension. Noncore represents acreage in the Bakken Lite, State Line and Elm Coulee areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area, we believe that with modern high-density completions and current well costs, the noncore acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. 
We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Noncore acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage, we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 net drilling locations, which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102-32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope Extension we have drilled using a high-density completion. The well came on online with a maximum rate of 3,395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic feet of rich natural gas, with an average rate of 2,760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4,300-foot lateral will be the highest-rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high-density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. 
In addition to improve returns to advance completions, we've made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well costs, which are now $7.1 million for an 8,400-foot treated lateral. This is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions and therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently, we are averaging more than 10 completion stages per day, up from 4 to 5 stages per day in 2014. In addition, plug drill-out times have been cut in half since 2014. 
Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result, we have seen dramatic LOE reductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential and drilling inventory illustrates the value of EOG's exploration and technology leadership. We interplay as the first mover and capture the best assets, then we grow them to the drill bit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. 
Here's Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford."

The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well cost. In the case of improved productivity, we are finding that wellbore targeting, along with our integrated completion approach, continues to provide upside on well performance. 
In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the Second Bone Spring Sand, testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State #501H and 502H were completed in a 1,000-foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1,075 and 1,755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com #501H tested 1,705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The completed well costs for the Second Bone Spring Sand are currently averaging $6 million per well, representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance, coupled with lower well cost, make this play very attractive in this low commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. 
During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the overpressured, oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County, New Mexico, the Dragon 36 State #701H and the Hearns 27 State Com #703H had initial production rates per well of 2,650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various targets and spacing patterns, this play promises to be a high-return growth asset for EOG. 
Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now costs $5.5 million and we are testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells. One recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Gem 36 State Com #1H had an initial production rate of 2,200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. 
Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOG's long-term growth. As typical with our other plays, EOG is -- will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating costs to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOG's Delaware Basin properties. 
Now moving to the Eagle Ford, which continues to be our workhorse asset. Due to the sheer scale of our operations there, it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled 4 pilot wells to gather additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific target's variability across the play. We are currently conducting test using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford, and the new data we've gathered on the targets is encouraging, as it supports our expectations for success. 
While it's too early to share results, we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress of cost-reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high-density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance, through the application of technology, is ensuring that this world-class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come.

Our macro view is we think, a pretty solid view. We do a lot of work and a lot of study on the process and we particularly model what everybody is saying in the U.S. and what they're going to be doing in the second half of this year through their guidance. And we really believe that in the second part of this year, we're going to see some strong month-over-month decline rates. And it may take -- it will take probably at least 2 or 3 more months for the monthly numbers to confirm this. There's a 2-month lag in the data. And the data does not -- as we know, not precise and it gets updated over time. So what we really need to see to confirm this is the July and August monthly data. And that'll come in, in September and October. So hopefully by that time, the declines will be a bit more evident to everybody. And if that happens, we could see a bit more firmness in the price. So our model shows, by what everybody is guiding, that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the 1.2 million barrels a day, last year, so there's a significant drop off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the -- if prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month-over-month decline rates in the U.S. and that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OPEC supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly, that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market.

We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.",597,"Thanks, Bill. We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1,500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent that have remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. 
In addition to the updated resource estimates, we split the Bakken into 2 categories that we have titled core acreage and noncore acreage. The core produces returns that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope Extension. Noncore represents acreage in the Bakken Lite, State Line and Elm Coulee areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area, we believe that with modern high-density completions and current well costs, the noncore acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. 
We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Noncore acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage, we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 net drilling locations, which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102-32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope Extension we have drilled using a high-density completion. The well came online with a maximum rate of 3,395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic feet of rich natural gas. With an average rate of 2,760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4,300-foot lateral will be the highest-rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high-density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. 
In addition to improved returns to advance completions, we've made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well costs, which are now $7.1 million for an 8,400-foot treated lateral. This is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions and therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently, we are averaging more than 10 completion stages per day, up from 4 to 5 stages per day in 2014. In addition, plug drill-out times have been cut in half since 2014. 
Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result, we have seen dramatic LOE reductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential and drilling inventory illustrates the value of EOG's exploration and technology leadership. We enter plays as the first mover and capture the best assets, then we grow them through the drill bit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. 
Here's Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford."

The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well cost. In the case of improved productivity, we are finding that wellbore targeting, along with our integrated completion approach, continues to provide upside on well performance. 
In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the Second Bone Spring Sand, testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State #501H and 502H, were completed in a 1,000-foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1,075 and 1,755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com #501H, tested 1,705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The completed well costs for the Second Bone Spring Sand are currently averaging $6 million per well, representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance, coupled with lower well cost, make this play very attractive in this low commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. 
During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the overpressured oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County, New Mexico, the Dragon 36 State #701H and the Hearns 27 State Com #703H, had initial production rates per well of 2,650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various targets and spacing patterns, this play promises to be a high-return growth asset for EOG. 
Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now costs $5.5 million and we are testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells. One recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Gem 36 State Com #1H, had an initial production rate of 2,200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. 
Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOG's long-term growth. As typical with our other plays, EOG is -- will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating costs to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOG's Delaware Basin properties. 
Now moving to the Eagle Ford, which continues to be our workhorse asset. Due to the sheer scale of our operations there, it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled 4 pilot wells to gather additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific target's variability across the play. We are currently conducting tests using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford, and the new data we've gathered on the targets is encouraging, as it supports our expectations for success. 
While it's too early to share results, we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress of cost-reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high-density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance, through the application of technology, is ensuring that this world-class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come.

Our macro view is we think, a pretty solid view. We do a lot of work and a lot of study on the process and we particularly model what everybody is saying in the U.S. and what they're going to be doing in the second half of this year through their guidance. And we really believe that in the second part of this year, we're going to see some strong month-over-month decline rates. And it may take -- it will take probably at least 2 or 3 more months for the monthly numbers to confirm this. There's a 2-month lag in the data. And the data does not -- as we know, not precise and it gets updated over time. So what we really need to see to confirm this is the July and August monthly data. And that'll come in, in September and October. So hopefully by that time, the declines will be a bit more evident to everybody. And if that happens, we could see a bit more firmness in the price. So our model shows, by what everybody is guiding, that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the 1.2 million barrels a day last year, so there's a significant drop off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the -- if prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month-over-month decline rates in the U.S. and that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OPEC supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly, that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market.

Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan focused on the following technology and innovation, three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet. 
As the year draws to a close, I'm pleased to report we're right on track with our plan. We're maximizing return on capital invested by directing capital to our best place: The Eagle Ford Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions, ongoing completions and the new work we're doing on targeting meaning EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after tax rate return of with $50 oil, making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement. 
On the cost side, we're making substantial improvements. Year-over-year, third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down six percent.
In recent years, we've grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling. 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high-quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and 3/4 net potential reserve by 600 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter, we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
As you read in our press release, we made 3 tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, adding significant high-quality drilling potential. In total, we have added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential and over 3,000 net locations this year. And we've achieved this incredible growth to our reserve and drilling potential while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. 
To summarize our progress report, in 2015, we maximize return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential, and maintained the strong balance sheet. All year long, our focus has been on improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG's priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter, our resource update to the Delaware Basin"
269660,313171029,895131,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2015",2015-11-06,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent, that's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The",1115,"Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent, that's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net new locations adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory. 
The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We have a proven track record of increasing a place potential. In this quarter it our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays. In the Wolfcamp, we are adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on the highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin. Like other plays, we have found that by first identifying and then targeting discrete intervals, we can dramatically improve the performance of the well and ultimately the recovery from the reservoir. There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp and we have successful tests in at least 3. This resource estimate with wells place in these intervals across all of our acreage with wells basin the that varies from 650 feet the 1,320  feet between wells in the same zone. The summarize it more simply, this resource estimate assumes at least 1 productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart. 
Similar to other resource plays, we are in a testing tighter spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter, we drilled a 2 well pattern on 880-foot spacing. The Dragon 36 State #701H and #702H. These wells rates average over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter, we drilled a 2 well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 apart. The Brown Bear 36 State #702H and #703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per well we are drilling wills while improving their EURs. 
Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 #702H. This is an industry record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30 day IP of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window which we identified late last year. Wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the combo play. With this resource update, we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 Mboe per well. Wells completed in the combo area maintain their previously estimated growth EUR of 900 Mboe per well. We're encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing and pattern along with multiple targets. With approximately 2/3 of our acreage in the oil window, this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices. 
In the Second Bone Spring Sand we initiated our net resource potential estimate of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp, this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets, and presented at least 1 productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks on a map locations. And while well spacing varies across the play by well and target in general, it averages about 850 feet. 
We first discussed this oil target last year and are very encouraged by initial well results. The Second Bone Spring Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity. The Leonard is the most mature of our Delaware Basin plays, in we continue to make progress improving results. Our recent 4 well package mentioned in the press release, the Hawk 35 7H through 10H was completed on 500-foot spacing with an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day, these wells are producing on par with Leonard wells drilled on wider spacing last year. Again, this is a testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward, we expect to develop this resource using 300 and 500-foot spacing. 
We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night, we announced that through 3 transactions, we added 2,600 net acres in Loving County Texas and Lee County New Mexico. Since the start of the year, we've mentioned our heightened interest and acquisition opportunities, driven by the oil price downcycle. While we didn't initially rule out corporate M&A, we quickly focus our efforts on targeting smaller, more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high-quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly perspective acreage and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our update Delaware Basin numbers. EOG's Delaware Basin potential was rapidly increasing, and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company. 
In the Eagle Ford, after 5 years and 3 resource upgrades to this world class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter's call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing tests, their vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique rock characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells from the 60 we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells by incorporating this data in our 3D seismic and [indiscernible] data. We determined that, that lower Eagle Ford may have 2 sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the flight in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding. 
The laterals in our W pattern test are geo-steered to very specific areas that meet specific criteria as. These targets can be as narrow as 20 feet. Initial results from these tests are promising. As we gather more data, conduct more tests and evaluate the results, we will bring you updates. 
I'll turn it over to David Trice to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies"

In the Rockies, we continue to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall last quarter, we announced that we're implementing high-density completions in some Rockies wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford. While the geology varies from day to play and even within the same play, we see upside in our ability to increase value through high-density and integrated completion techniques. 
In the Bakken, we are focused on completing infield wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infield wells are among old producing wells, our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively simulate the reservoir and deliver high rate return at maximum value. 
An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a 3 will pad on the partial up 30 and 29 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day on rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use a shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet. 
Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud to TD for 80 400 foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014. 
In addition, we've lowered LOE in the Bakken core area, up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investments like water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel oil equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low price environment. 
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high-density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results. However, initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a full well pad that targeted the Codell sandstone. These wells are located in the Whidbey 1705 and 1720 units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 mcf per day of rich natural gas per well, using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet. 
The recent well cost in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for 90 400 foot lateral with the latest well performance and lower well cost, the Codell is delivering a direct A-tax read return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down cost, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we're transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment. 
The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG. Although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG.

Year-to-date, total cash expiration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million. 
During the third quarter, EOG incurred $4.1 billion in noncash property impairment charges net of tax. The Impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets. 
At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion or debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt-to-total capital ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the noncash impairment recognized this quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35% and the deferred tax ratio was 101%. In terms of our hedge positions, for the period November 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at an weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition, for November 2015, EOG has put options in place which established a floor price of $45 or 82,000 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Our view has not changed. The industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production declined based on EIA data and can exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide, longer-term projects are being cut. Though we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply and demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing. Regarding 2016. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I will share a little color on our situation. EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We will enter 2016 with a large high-quality inventory of drill but uncompleted wells, and we have view capital commitments. Therefore, we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. And, as always, we have no interest in outspending our discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating costs. 2015 is rapidly coming to a close and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I said at the start of the year, I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company. Each time, EOG emerges on the other side and better shape. This is the exact how 2015 is playing out. There is 1 primarily take away from the call today, EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in the low oil price environment. We are not depending on a rebound to high oil prices. Instead we're making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact, 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of improvements in the company. Regardless of where we are in the commodity cycle, EOG is committed to return focused, capital disciplined year after year. The company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A."

So we're not -- we're just focused solely on the W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford. And that's largely been the focus, as a result of our targeting efforts as they started in the lower Eagle Ford. We identified through our analysis of all the core data and the better data that we had that there are 2 sweet spot intervals that we wanted to target. It still early on. We've just started testing those and we're testing those in several areas across the field. But we are encouraged with the early results. The early results look to indicate that these 2 areas -- these 2 sweet spot intervals aren't interfering with each other during the production phase. So that gives us a lot of encouragement for additional resource that we'll be able to capture in the future. It's still early yet to really quantify the results from that test.

It's really, we just don't have commitments to international. We don't have lease retention. We don't have as much heavy infrastructure especially first part of the year, and we don't have a lot of service contracts in place. So we're free to really put our money on the best rate of return projects or wells in the company, and we're also free to bury that capital spend rate based on the commodity price. And we can react very quickly. So as we said we're not going to give specific growth numbers or production numbers or CapEx numbers until February because we're very committed to staying within cash flow. So that will really determine our view of, basically we'll use the strip prices plus form factor that we have on the macro to kind of determine our CapEx for the year.

There are multiple targets, multiple formations and we're -- we've done -- our team has done a great job on really delineating their understanding of the play with the data that we have.

Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan focused on the following objectives: one, maximize return on capital invested; two, improve loyal performance through technology and innovation; three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage of opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet.
As the year draws to a close, I'm pleased to report we're right on track with our plan. We're maximizing return on capital invested by directing capital to our best plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions, ongoing completions and the new work we're doing on targeting, meaning EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after-tax rate of return with $50 oil. Making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement.
On the cost side, we're making substantial improvements. Year-over-year, third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down 6%.
In recent years, we've grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling. 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high-quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and Three Forks net potential reserves by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter, we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
As you read in our press release, we made 3 tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, adding significant high-quality drilling potential. In total, we have added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential and over 3,000 net locations this year. And we've achieved this incredible growth to our reserve and drilling potential while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
To summarize our progress report, in 2015, we maximize return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential and maintained a strong balance sheet. All year long, our focus has been on improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG's priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter, our resource upgrade to the Delaware Basin."
269660,313171029,895657,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2015",2015-11-06,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net locations, adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory.
The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We have a proven track record of increasing a play's potential, and this quarter, our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays. In the Wolfcamp, we are adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on a highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin. Like other plays, we have found that by, first, identifying and then targeting discrete intervals, we can dramatically improve the performance of the wells and ultimately, the recovery from the reservoir.
There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp, and we have successful tests in at least 3. This resource estimate includes wells placed in these tested intervals across all of our acreage with wells basin that varies from 660 feet to 1,320 feet between wells in the same zone. To summarize it more simply, this resource estimate assumes at least 1 productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart.
Similar to other resource plays, we are testing tighter spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern on an 880-foot spacing, the Dragon 36 State #701H and #702H. These wells have rates average over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 feet apart. The Brown Bear 36 State #702H and #703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per well. We are drilling wells closer while maintaining or improving their EURs.
Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 #702H. This is an industry-record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30-day IP of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window, which we identified late last year. Wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the Combo play. With this resource update, we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 MBoe per well. Wells completed in the Combo area maintain their previously estimated gross EUR of 900 MBoe per well. We're encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing patterns, along with multiple targets. With approximately 2/3 of our acreage in the oil window, this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices.
In the Second Bone Spring Sand, we initiated our net resource potential estimate of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp, this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets and percentage at least 1 productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks-on-a-map locations. And while well spacing varies across the play by area and target, in general, it averages about 850 feet.
We first discussed this oil target last year and are very encouraged with initial well results. The Second Bone Spring Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity. The Leonard is the most mature of our Delaware Basin plays, and we continue to make progress improving results. Our recent 4-well package mentioned in the press release, the Hawk 35 Fed #7H through #10H, was completed on 500-foot spacing. With an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day, these wells are producing on par with Leonard wells drilled on wider spacing last year. Again, this is a testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward, we expect to develop this resource using 300- to 500-foot spacing.
We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night, we announced that through 3 transactions, we added 2,600 net acres in Loving County, Texas and Lee County in New Mexico. Since the start of the year, we've mentioned our heightened interest in acquisition opportunities driven by the oil price downcycle. While we didn't initially roll out corporate M&A, we quickly focused our efforts on targeting smaller, more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high-quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly perspective acreage, and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our updated Delaware Basin numbers. EOG's Delaware Basin potential was rapidly increasing, and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company.
In the Eagle Ford, after 5 years and 3 resource upgrades to this world-class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter's call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing tests: their vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique rock characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells. From these 60, we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells by incorporating this data into our 3D seismic and petrophysical data. We determined that the lower Eagle Ford may have 2 sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the slide in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding.
The laterals in our W-patterned test are geo-steered to very specific areas that meet specific criteria. These targets can be as narrow as 20 feet. Initial results from these tests are promising. As we gather more data, conduct more tests and evaluate the results, we will bring you updates.
I'll turn it over to David Trice to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies."

In the Rockies, we continue to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall, last quarter, we announced that we are implementing high-density completions in some Rockies wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford. While the geology varies from play to play and even within the same play, we see upside in our ability to increase value through high-density and integrated completion techniques.
In the Bakken, we are focused on completing infill wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infill wells are among old producing wells, our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively stimulate the reservoir and deliver high rate of return at maximum value.
An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a 3-well pad on the Parshall 3029 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet.
Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014.
In addition, we've lowered LOE in the Bakken core area up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investments such as water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low oil price environment.
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high-density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results. However, initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a 4-well pad that targeted the Codell sandstone. These wells are located in the Wind 1705H and 1720H units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 Mcf per day of rich natural gas per well using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet.
Recent well cost in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for 9,400-foot lateral. With the latest well performance and lower well cost, the Codell is delivering a direct a-tax rate of return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down cost, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we are transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment.
The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG. Although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG.

Total cash expiration and development expenditures were $970 million, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $51 million. There were $368 million of property acquisitions during the quarter. Year-to-date, total cash expiration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million.
During the third quarter, EOG incurred $4.1 billion in noncash property impairment charges net of tax. The impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets.
At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion or debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the noncash impairment recognized this quarter.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35%, and the deferred tax ratio was 101%.
In terms of our hedge positions. For the period November 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition, for November 2015, EOG has put options in place, which established a floor price of $45 per barrel or 82,500 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu.

Our view has not changed. The industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production decline based on EIA data and could exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide, longer-term projects are being cut, though we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply and demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing.
Regarding 2016. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I will share a little color on our situation.
EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We will enter 2016 with a large high-quality inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, and we have few capital commitments. Therefore, we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. And as always, we have no interest in outspending our discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating costs.
2015 is rapidly coming to a close, and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I said at the start of the year, I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company. Each time, EOG emerges on the other side and better shape. This is exactly how 2015 is playing out.
There is one primary takeaway from the call today, EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We are not depending on a rebound to high oil prices. Instead, we're making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact, 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of the improvements in the company. Regardless of where we are in the commodity cycle, EOG is committed to return focused, capital disciplined year after year. The company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value.

There are all multiple targets, multiple formations, and we're -- we've done a -- our team out there has done a great job of really delineating their understanding of the play with the data that we have. And we're always collecting more and more data as we develop the program. So I'd say, just to boil it down to maybe baseball terms, we're probably maybe third inning on the Delaware Basin as opposed to sixth or seventh inning maybe on the Eagle Ford, for instance."

I know that the most prominent thing we see is these great IP rates that you guys are turning in, but the other thing that I believe you mentioned and we certainly see with the results on these Thor wells is that, particularly for this Thor well, the 30 day rate is -- at least, is as remarkable as the IP rate. And I'm curious, when you look at the effect that these advanced completions are having on your production profile, should we be thinking about the -- 3Q being a function of wells were completed in 3Q? Or is it more a function of the wells that were completed in the first half of the year that are not -- that are holding up better with lower decline that, really, are leading to this beat [ph] like this."

And we've been doing this for a while longer in some of the other plays, namely, the Eagle Ford, and yes, we are seeing the decline is not as deep on those wells.

The only thing that I would add, Charles, to that is I think that we are -- the acquisitions we have done are largely staying within our focus of growing organically. The difference would be that organic growth in new plays, we're still able to go out and get ahead of the competition and acquire positions in new plays fairly cheaply. In the Delaware Basin, it's a very mature basin, a lot of ownership, legacy ownerships have been out there for years and years as everybody knows. So one way to gain entry into the acreage that we see quite a bit of upside is through these tactical acquisitions. And I would add to Bill's comment. We are being highly selective in what we acquire. So we passed up several opportunities that had been transacted that we just passed on. And we did focus on these 3 tactical acquisitions that we are very encouraged with. And as a matter of fact, we already have drilling operations going on, on these -- on the acreage that we acquired.

One, the Wolfcamp is generating really high rate of returns that are competitive with pretty much every play in the company. And then two, it really gives us -- by drilling the deeper objective, it gives us a chance to evaluate the shallower objectives as we drill through them. So we can gather log data and other data that we need to really help delineate the shallower plays. And that'll help us improve our returns on those plays, make them even stronger, when we do start our development in those plays. On the infrastructure, we -- we're focusing most of our activity in areas where we already have existing infrastructure. As we step out and test some of the new areas, we're certainly going to have to build out an infrastructure in those areas. But right now, most of our activity is in areas where we have infrastructure available to us."

Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan focused on the following objectives: one, maximize return on capital invested; two, improve well performance through technology and innovation; three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage of opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet.
As the year draws to a close, I'm pleased to report we're right on track with our plan. We're maximizing return on capital invested by directing capital to our best plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions, ongoing completions and the new work we're doing on targeting, mean EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after-tax rate of return with $50 oil. Making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement.
On the cost side, we're making substantial improvements. Year-over-year, third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down 6%.
In recent years, we've grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling. 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high-quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and Three Forks net potential reserves by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter, we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
As you read in our press release, we made 3 tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, adding significant high-quality drilling potential. In total, we have added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential in over 3,000 net locations this year. And we've achieved this incredible growth to our reserve and drilling potential while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
To summarize our progress report, in 2015, we maximized return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential and maintained a strong balance sheet. All year long, our focus has been on improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG's priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter, our resource upgrade to the Delaware Basin."
269660,313171029,895906,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2015",2015-11-06,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The",1106,"Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net locations, adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory.
The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We have a proven track record of increasing a play's potential, and this quarter, our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays. In the Wolfcamp, we are adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on a highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin. Like other plays, we have found that by, first, identifying and then targeting discrete intervals, we can dramatically improve the performance of the wells and ultimately, the recovery from the reservoir.
There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp, and we have successful tests in at least 3. This resource estimate includes wells placed in these tested intervals across all of our acreage with well spacing that varies from 660 feet to 1,320 feet between wells in the same zone. To summarize it more simply, this resource estimate assumes at least 1 productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart.
Similar to other resource plays, we are testing tighter spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern on 880-foot spacing, the Dragon 36 State #701H and #702H. These wells had IP rates averaged over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 feet apart. The Brown Bear 36 State #702H and #703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per well. We are drilling wells closer while maintaining or improving their EURs.
Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 #702H. This is an industry-record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30-day IP of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window, which we identified late last year. Wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the Combo play. With this resource update, we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 MBoe per well. Wells completed in the Combo area maintain their previously estimated gross EUR of 900 MBoe per well. We're encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing patterns, along with multiple targets. With approximately 2/3 of our acreage in the oil window, this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices.
In the Second Bone Spring Sand, we initiated our net resource potential estimate of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp, this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets and presumes at least 1 productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks-on-a-map locations. And while well spacing varies across the play by area and target, in general, it averages about 850 feet.
We first discussed this oily target last year and are very encouraged with initial well results. The Second Bone Spring Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity. The Leonard is the most mature of our Delaware Basin plays, and we continue to make progress improving results. Our recent 4-well package mentioned in the press release, the Hawk 35 Fed #7H through #10H, was completed on 500-foot spacing. With an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day, these wells are producing on par with Leonard wells drilled on wider spacing last year. Again, this is a testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward, we expect to develop this resource using 300- to 500-foot spacing.
We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night, we announced that through 3 transactions, we added 2,600 net acres in Loving County, Texas and Lee County, New Mexico. Since the start of the year, we've mentioned our heightened interest in acquisition opportunities driven by the oil price downcycle. While we didn't initially rule out corporate M&A, we quickly focused our efforts on targeting smaller, more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high-quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly prospective acreage, and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our updated Delaware Basin numbers. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly increasing, and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company.
In the Eagle Ford, after 5 years and 3 resource upgrades to this world-class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter's call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing test: the vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique rock characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells. From these 60, we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells. By incorporating this data into our 3D seismic and petrophysical data, we determined that the lower Eagle Ford may have 2 sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the slide in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding.

In the Rockies, we continued to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall, last quarter, we announced that we are implementing high-density completions in some Rockies wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford. While the geology varies from play to play and even within the same play, we see upside in our ability to increase value through high-density and integrated completion techniques.
In the Bakken, we are focused on completing infill wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infill wells are among old producing wells, our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively stimulate the reservoir and deliver a high rate of return and maximum value.
An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a 3-well pad on the Parshall 3029 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet.
Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014.
In addition, we've lowered LOE in the Bakken core area up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investments such as water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low oil price environment.
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high-density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results. However, initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a 4-well pad that targeted the Codell sandstone. These wells are located in the Windy 1705H and 1720H units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 Mcf per day of rich natural gas per well using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet.
Recent well costs in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for 9,400-foot lateral. With the latest well performance and lower well costs, the Codell is delivering a direct a-tax rate of return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down costs, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we are transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment.
The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG. Although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Total cash expiration and development expenditures were $970 million, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $51 million. There were $368 million of property acquisitions during the quarter. Year-to-date, total cash expiration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million.
During the third quarter, EOG incurred $4.1 billion in noncash property impairment charges net of tax. The impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets.
At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the noncash impairment recognized this quarter.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35%, and the deferred tax ratio was 101%.
In terms of our hedge positions. For the period November 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition, for November 2015, EOG has put options in place, which establish a floor price of $45 per barrel for 82,500 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu.

Our view has not changed. The industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production decline based on EIA data and could exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide, longer-term projects are being cut, though we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply and demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing.
Regarding 2016. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I will share a little color on our situation.
EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We will enter 2016 with a large high-quality inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, and we have few capital commitments. Therefore, we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. And as always, we have no interest in outspending our discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating costs.
2015 is rapidly coming to a close, and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I said at the start of the year, I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company. Each time, EOG emerges on the other side in better shape. This is exactly how 2015 is playing out.
There is one primary takeaway from the call today, EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We are not depending on a rebound to high oil prices. Instead, we're making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact, 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of the improvements in the company. Regardless of where we are in the commodity cycle, EOG is committed to return-focused capital discipline year after year. The company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value.
Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A."

We've just started testing those, and we're testing those in several areas across the field. But we are encouraged with the early results. The early results look to indicate that these 2 areas -- these 2 sweet spot intervals aren't interfering with each other during the production phase.

We don't have as much heavy infrastructure, especially first part of the year, and we don't have a lot of service contracts in place. So we're free to really put our money on the best rate of return projects or wells in the company, and we're also free to vary that capital spend rate based on the commodity price. And we can react very quickly. So as we said, we're not going to -- we won't give specific growth numbers or production numbers or CapEx numbers until February because we are very committed to staying within cash flow. So that will really determine our view of -- basically, we'll use the strip prices plus some factor that we have on the macro to kind of determine our CapEx for the year.

Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment.

Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan focused on the following objectives: one, maximize return on capital invested; two, improve well performance through technology and innovation; three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage of opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet.
As the year draws to a close, I'm pleased to report we're right on track with our plan. We're maximizing return on capital invested by directing capital to our best plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions, ongoing completions and the new work we're doing on targeting, mean EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after-tax rate of return with $50 oil. Making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement.
On the cost side, we're making substantial improvements. Year-over-year, third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down 6%.
In recent years, we've grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling. 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high-quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and Three Forks net potential reserves by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter, we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
As you read in our press release, we made 3 tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, adding significant high-quality drilling potential. In total, we have added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential in over 3,000 net locations this year. And we've achieved this incredible growth to our reserve and drilling potential while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
To summarize our progress report, in 2015, we maximized return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential and maintained a strong balance sheet. All year long, our focus has been on improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG's priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter, our resource upgrade to the Delaware Basin."
269660,313171029,896220,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2015",2015-11-06,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Last night, we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's a 74% increase from our resource estimate just 2 years ago. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net locations, adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory.
The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We have a proven track record of increasing a play's potential, and this quarter, our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays. In the Wolfcamp, we are adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on a highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin. Like other plays, we have found that by, first, identifying and then targeting discrete intervals, we can dramatically improve the performance of the wells and ultimately, the recovery from the reservoir.
There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp, and we have successful tests in at least 3. This resource estimate includes wells placed in these tested intervals across all of our acreage with well spacing that varies from 660 feet to 1,320 feet between wells in the same zone. To summarize it more simply, this resource estimate assumes at least 1 productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart.
Similar to other resource plays, we are testing tighter spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern on 880-foot spacing, the Dragon 36 State #701H and #702H. These wells had IP rates averaged over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter, we drilled a 2-well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 feet apart. The Brown Bear 36 State #702H and #703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per well. We are drilling wells closer while maintaining or improving their EURs.
Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 #702H. This is an industry-record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30-day IP of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window, which we identified late last year. Wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the Combo play. With this resource update, we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 MBoe per well. Wells completed in the Combo area maintain their previously estimated gross EUR of 900 MBoe per well. We're encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing patterns, along with multiple targets. With approximately 2/3 of our acreage in the oil window, this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices.
In the Second Bone Spring Sand, we initiated our net resource potential estimate of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp, this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets and presumes at least 1 productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks-on-a-map locations. And while well spacing varies across the play by area and target, in general, it averages about 850 feet.
We first discussed this oily target last year and are very encouraged with initial well results. The Second Bone Spring Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity. The Leonard is the most mature of our Delaware Basin plays, and we continue to make progress improving results. Our recent 4-well package mentioned in the press release, the Hawk 35 Fed #7H through #10H, was completed on 500-foot spacing. With an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day, these wells are producing on par with Leonard wells drilled on wider spacing last year. Again, this is a testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward, we expect to develop this resource using 300- to 500-foot spacing.
We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night, we announced that through 3 transactions, we added 2,600 net acres in Loving County, Texas and Lee County, New Mexico. Since the start of the year, we've mentioned our heightened interest in acquisition opportunities driven by the oil price downcycle. While we didn't initially rule out corporate M&A, we quickly focused our efforts on targeting smaller, more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high-quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly prospective acreage, and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our updated Delaware Basin numbers. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly increasing, and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company.
In the Eagle Ford, after 5 years and 3 resource upgrades to this world-class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter's call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing test: the vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique rock characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells. From these 60, we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells. By incorporating this data into our 3D seismic and petrophysical data, we determined that the lower Eagle Ford may have 2 sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the slide in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding.
The laterals in our W-pattern test are geo-steered to very specific areas that meet specific criteria. These targets can be as narrow as 20 feet. Initial results from these tests are promising. As we gather more data, conduct more tests and evaluate the results, we will bring you updates.
I'll turn it over to David Trice to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies."

In the Rockies, we continued to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall, last quarter, we announced that we are implementing high-density completions in some Rockies wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford. While the geology varies from play to play and even within the same play, we see upside in our ability to increase value through high-density and integrated completion techniques.
In the Bakken, we are focused on completing infill wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infill wells are among old producing wells, our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively stimulate the reservoir and deliver a high rate of return and maximum value.
An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a 3-well pad on the Parshall 3029 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet.
Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014.
In addition, we've lowered LOE in the Bakken core area up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investments such as water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low oil price environment.
In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high-density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results. However, initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a 4-well pad that targeted the Codell sandstone. These wells are located in the Windy 1705H and 1720H units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 Mcf per day of rich natural gas per well using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet.
Recent well costs in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for 9,400-foot lateral. With the latest well performance and lower well costs, the Codell is delivering a direct a-tax rate of return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down costs, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we are transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment.
The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG. Although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG.

In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $51 million. There were $368 million of property acquisitions during the quarter. Year-to-date, total cash expiration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million.
During the third quarter, EOG incurred $4.1 billion in noncash property impairment charges net of tax. The impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets.
At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the noncash impairment recognized this quarter.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35%, and the deferred tax ratio was 101%.
In terms of our hedge positions. For the period November 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition, for November 2015, EOG has put options in place, which establish a floor price of $45 per barrel for 82,500 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu.

Our view has not changed. The industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production decline based on EIA data and could exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide, longer-term projects are being cut, though we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply and demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing.
Regarding 2016. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I will share a little color on our situation.
EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We will enter 2016 with a large high-quality inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, and we have few capital commitments. Therefore, we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. And as always, we have no interest in outspending our discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating costs.
2015 is rapidly coming to a close, and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I said at the start of the year, I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company. Each time, EOG emerges on the other side in better shape. This is exactly how 2015 is playing out.
There is one primary takeaway from the call today, EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We are not depending on a rebound to high oil prices. Instead, we're making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact, 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of the improvements in the company. Regardless of where we are in the commodity cycle, EOG is committed to return-focused capital discipline year after year. The company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value.

And we hope to be able to give you some very positive news in the future on the performance of those efforts."

So we're not -- we're just focused solely on the W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford. And that's largely been the focus as a result of our targeting efforts as they started in the lower Eagle Ford. We identified through our analysis of all the core data and the petrophysical data that we have that there are 2 sweet spot intervals that we wanted to target. It's still early on. We've just started testing those, and we're testing those in several areas across the field. But we are encouraged with the early results. The early results look to indicate that these 2 areas -- these 2 sweet spot intervals aren't interfering with each other during the production phase. So that gives us a lot of encouragement for additional resource that we'll be able to capture in the future. It's still early yet to really quantify the results from that test. But I'd say we're optimistic about the results."

So as we said, we're not going to -- we won't give specific growth numbers or production numbers or CapEx numbers until February because we are very committed to staying within cash flow.

Yes, for the Delaware Basin, as you mentioned there, we are earlier in the ability to really get into a good development program there.

And I'm curious, when you look at the effect that these advanced completions are having on your production profile, should we be thinking about the beat in 3Q being a function of wells that were completed in 3Q?

In the Delaware Basin, it's a very mature basin, a lot of ownership, legacy ownership has been out there for years and years as everybody knows. So one way to gain entry into acreage that we see quite a bit of upside is through these tactical acquisitions. And I would add to Bill's comment. We are being highly selective in what we acquire. So we passed up several opportunities that had been transacted that we just passed on. And we did focus on these 3 tactical acquisitions that we are very encouraged with.

First, I will discuss the outstanding progress we've made transitioning the company to be successful in a lower oil price environment and I'll explain why EOG is uniquely positioned to accomplish this. Second, I will describe the framework we're using to determine our activity level for the remainder of the year. Our goal this year is to remain laser-focused on improving returns. At the beginning of the year, we noted that our after-tax rate of return at $65 oil were better than at $95 oil, 3 years ago. We are pleased to report that we have further improved these well economics even as oil prices have declined. Through improved well productivity and lower cost, our key oil plays now earn a 30% after-tax rate of return with a flat $50 oil price. We have multiple decades of drilling inventory in these high-return, world-class assets. 
EOG is rapidly adjusting to lower oil prices. We believe that our ability to quickly adapt to this new environment illustrates our competitive advantages. There are 5 drivers, which make EOG uniquely positioned to improve returns year after year. The first is large, high-quality assets. We've captured the sweet spots in the best horizontal crude oil assets in the U.S.: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. The quality of our assets is why EOG drills the most productive oil wells in the U.S. The scale of our positions drives tremendous efficiencies and the diversity of our assets allows us to transfer technology gains and cost savings from basin to basin. 
The second driver is innovation and technology. New ideas and technical drive -- technically drive continuous productivity improvements. For example, we developed in-house, integrated completion technology that consistently drives field recoveries higher and maximizes NPV. During the first 5 years of drilling the Eagle Ford, we increased its reserve potential 250%. This quarter, we increased our Bakken net potential reserves to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 150% increase. EOG has over 10 years of horizontal shale experience to build on and we expect to continue advancing our knowledge through innovation and technology. 
The third is low cost. We believe EOG's well and operating costs were already the lowest in the industry, and 2015 is proving to be our best year ever for realizing additional cost reductions. EOG's scale and high-quality assets and proprietary technology will continue to drive future efficiency gains and cost reductions. 
The fourth driver is organic growth. This is the lowest cost, highest return approach to adding drilling potential. Being first movers in exploration allows us to capture large amounts of high-quality rock at much lower cost than through acquisition and exploit strategy. Organic exploration is an important competitive advantage for EOG, and we see significant opportunities ahead of us. 
Last but not least is EOG's organization and culture. This is the catalyst for the first 4 drivers and underpins our competitive advantage. A decentralized structure encourages asset level, bottom-up decision-making, which leads to better execution. Our core culture is return driven. Employee performance is incentivized by rate of return, which is a key driver to our share [ph] leading return on capital employed. Return-based decision-making and incentives drives EOG's success. 
The second item I would cover today is our plan for the remainder of 2015. We are maintaining total company oil production guidance while reducing 2015 CapEx guidance by approximately $200 million. In addition, our projected year-end uncompleted well inventory has increased from 285 to 320. The bottom line is productivity improvements and reduced cost are allowing us to produce more oil with less capital. Many of you are asking, ""When will EOG grow oil again?"" We have said all along that we do not want to grow production until we see the oil market is firmly rebalancing. We will be watching the supply demand fundamentals in the second half of this year closely as we determine our plan for 2016. Currently, we intend to spend within cash flow. The capital efficiency gains we've made this year, along with our large high-quality inventory of uncompleted wells, positions us for an excellent 2016. 
My #1 message is this: we're resetting the economics of our business. EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We expect EOG to remain the lowest cost U.S. shale producer and competitive in the world oil market. 
I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss the update on our Bakken resource estimates as well as other activities in the Rockies."

We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.",597,"Thanks, Bill. We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1,500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent that have remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. 
In addition to the updated resource estimates, we split the Bakken into 2 categories that we have titled core acreage and noncore acreage. The core produces returns that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope Extension. Noncore represents acreage in the Bakken Lite, State Line and Elm Coulee areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area, we believe that with modern high-density completions and current well costs, the noncore acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. 
We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Noncore acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage, we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 net drilling locations, which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102-32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope Extension we have drilled using a high-density completion. The well came online with a maximum rate of 3,395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic feet of rich natural gas. With an average rate of 2,760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4,300-foot lateral will be the highest-rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high-density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. 
In addition to improved returns to advance completions, we've made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well costs, which are now $7.1 million for an 8,400-foot treated lateral. This is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions and therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently, we are averaging more than 10 completion stages per day, up from 4 to 5 stages per day in 2014. In addition, plug drill-out times have been cut in half since 2014. 
Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result, we have seen dramatic LOE reductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential and drilling inventory illustrates the value of EOG's exploration and technology leadership. We enter plays as the first mover and capture the best assets, then we grow them through the drill bit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. 
Here's Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford."

The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well cost. In the case of improved productivity, we are finding that wellbore targeting, along with our integrated completion approach, continues to provide upside on well performance. 
In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the Second Bone Spring Sand, testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State #501H and 502H, were completed in a 1,000-foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1,075 and 1,755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com #501H, tested 1,705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The completed well costs for the Second Bone Spring Sand are currently averaging $6 million per well, representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance, coupled with lower well cost, make this play very attractive in this low commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. 
During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the overpressured oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County, New Mexico, the Dragon 36 State #701H and the Hearns 27 State Com #703H, had initial production rates per well of 2,650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various targets and spacing patterns, this play promises to be a high-return growth asset for EOG. 
Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now costs $5.5 million and we are testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells. One recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Gem 36 State Com #1H, had an initial production rate of 2,200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. 
Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOG's long-term growth. As typical with our other plays, EOG is -- will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating costs to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOG's Delaware Basin properties. 
Now moving to the Eagle Ford, which continues to be our workhorse asset. Due to the sheer scale of our operations there, it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled 4 pilot wells to gather additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific target's variability across the play. We are currently conducting tests using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford, and the new data we've gathered on the targets is encouraging, as it supports our expectations for success. 
While it's too early to share results, we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress of cost-reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high-density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance, through the application of technology, is ensuring that this world-class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $85 million. 
At the end of June 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5 billion for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 22%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. In July, we successfully entered into a new $2 billion credit agreement to replace the existing one, which would've matured in October 2016. Terms of the new agreement were similar to the prior credit agreement. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 146%, and current tax expense was $41 million. For the period August 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swaps contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. For the second -- I'm sorry, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu.

Low oil prices are slowing supply growth and encouraging demand worldwide. We believe U.S. oil production will have significant month-over-month declines in the second half of this year. So our assessment is, there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. 
In summary, before we open up the call for Q&A, I want to talk about the core fundamentals that defined EOG's strategy for creating long-term shareholder value. The first core fundamental is that EOG is return-driven. We allocate capital in order to earn the highest returns. As we've done for many years, our goal is to be the peer leader in capital returns. Our second core fundamental is organic growth. Growing through the drill bit is the most return-friendly and therefore, shareholder-friendly means of growth. Our goal is to be the leader in organic U.S. oil growth. The third core fundamental is a strong balance sheet. Our goal is to maintain a disciplined spending program that keeps our net debt low and liquidity strong. Finally, the fourth core fundamental is commitment to the dividend. Our track record indicates our continued commitment to the dividend. Staying focused on these 4 core fundamentals, return-driven, organic growth, strong balance sheet and commitment to the dividend is how EOG consistently delivers long-term shareholder value. 
Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A."

Our macro view is we think, a pretty solid view. We do a lot of work and a lot of study on the process and we particularly model what everybody is saying in the U.S. and what they're going to be doing in the second half of this year through their guidance. And we really believe that in the second part of this year, we're going to see some strong month-over-month decline rates. And it may take -- it will take probably at least 2 or 3 more months for the monthly numbers to confirm this. There's a 2-month lag in the data. And the data does not -- as we know, not precise and it gets updated over time. So what we really need to see to confirm this is the July and August monthly data. And that'll come in, in September and October. So hopefully by that time, the declines will be a bit more evident to everybody. And if that happens, we could see a bit more firmness in the price. So our model shows, by what everybody is guiding, that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the 1.2 million barrels a day last year, so there's a significant drop off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the -- if prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month-over-month decline rates in the U.S. and that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OPEC supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly, that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market. The other thing is certainly is that we just can't see a good business reason to outspend growing oil in an oversupplied oil market. That just does not make sense to us, so we believe we made the right decision."

And the capital required for growth in 2016 is considerably lower than we had in the previous years. Number one, as you noted, we've gotten -- we've achieved very strong efficiency gains on the capital by lowering the cost, by baking better wells through technology. And we're going to be able to continue that process in the second half of the year and really reap the benefits of that in 2016. And the second thing is that as we talked about, we have a very large, now 320 estimate, 320 uncompleted well inventory that will be very high quality. I think it'll be the highest-quality inventory of any operator in the U.S. And that inventory is ready to complete -- to begin completion early in the year, next year. We have infrastructure in place for all that uncompleted inventory, so that won't slow us down. And then we're making significant improvements in lowering decline rates in a number of different ways. The first one is we continue to drill our laterals in better rock. We're drilling -- we're taking a lot of time and effort, picking out the best quality rock in each one of these plays and keeping the lateral in that longer. And then when we -- and to execute that well is very important. And when we do that, we now are doing a much better job with the high-density fracs, better distributing the frac along the lateral, connecting it more with that good rock, and it's certainly lowering our decline rates over time and that makes it easier to grow production. And the last thing, which is very important, we have tremendous capital flexibility in 2016. We don't have many service or rig contracts that will be in place as we begin 2016. We have very few lease retention requirements and we have very few international commitments. So we're fully flexible to concentrate our capital, particularly in the first half of the year on this very high-quality uncompleted well inventory. We're not going to give any specific guidance on our CapEx until February next year. We want to work the details. And so we're just going to -- we'll make our CapEx plan based on what the 2016 forward curve looks like in February.

We're thrilled with the results and we're being able -- at first, our cost was a little bit higher, and you'll notice that looking at the Eagle Ford, slightly higher.

We are seeing opportunities in different basins, and we are actively looking at things. We're still optimistic that there -- we're going to be able to do some more small tactical acquisitions and build acreage positions in some of our key or emerging plays. We are having some success in just acquiring leasehold in some of our new emerging plays, more so than we have in the past, so that's positive.

So the frac does not frac out as long, as far in a lateral extent or even -- and it doesn't frac vertically, a great distance to connect up with a significant amount of rock. And so the fracs are not competing with each other for production. So we used to think, and it's really been a shift in thinking, we used to think that these big fracs just connected up a lot of rock both laterally and vertically. But as we go forward, and we changed the design and we get more data, we become more convinced that the frac is just, especially these high-density fracs, is really most effective very, very close to the wellbore.

So we still have a lot to learn about the Wolfcamp. And the other thing we're doing is with the Wolfcamp being in the deeper target, we're gathering additional data on the Leonard and Bone Springs pay zones when we drill down through those on our way to the Wolfcamp. So by gathering additional petrophysical data and rock data, we're better able to look at the variability of the pay sections in those 2 shallower pay zones and gives us a better idea about how to develop those, how to better target those and where the best upside might be.

269660,306412228,2472597,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. There are a couple of items I will cover with you on the call today.

There are a couple of items I will cover with you on the call today. First, I will discuss the outstanding progress we've made transitioning the company to be successful in a lower oil price environment and I'll explain why EOG is uniquely positioned to accomplish this. Second, I will describe the framework we're using to determine our activity level for the remainder of the year. Our goal this year is to remain laser-focused on improving returns. At the beginning of the year, we noted that our after-tax rate of return at $65 oil were better than at $95 oil, 3 years ago. We are pleased to report that we have further improved these well economics even as oil prices have declined. Through improved well productivity and lower cost, our key oil plays now earn a 30% after-tax rate of return with a flat $50 oil price. We have multiple decades of drilling inventory in these high-return, world-class assets. 
EOG is rapidly adjusting to lower oil prices. We believe that our ability to quickly adapt to this new environment illustrates our competitive advantages. There are 5 drivers, which make EOG uniquely positioned to improve returns year after year. The first is large, high-quality assets. We've captured the sweet spots in the best horizontal crude oil assets in the U.S.: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. The quality of our assets is why EOG drills the most productive oil wells in the U.S. The scale of our positions drives tremendous efficiencies and the diversity of our assets allows us to transfer technology gains and cost savings from basin to basin. 
The second driver is innovation and technology. New ideas and technical drive -- technically drive continuous productivity improvements. For example, we developed in-house, integrated completion technology that consistently drives field recoveries higher and maximizes NPV. During the first 5 years of drilling the Eagle Ford, we increased its reserve potential 250%. This quarter, we increased our Bakken net potential reserves to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 150% increase. EOG has over 10 years of horizontal shale experience to build on and we expect to continue advancing our knowledge through innovation and technology. 
The third is low cost. We believe EOG's well and operating costs were already the lowest in the industry, and 2015 is proving to be our best year ever for realizing additional cost reductions. EOG's scale and high-quality assets and proprietary technology will continue to drive future efficiency gains and cost reductions. 
The fourth driver is organic growth. This is the lowest cost, highest return approach to adding drilling potential. Being first movers in exploration allows us to capture large amounts of high-quality rock at much lower cost than through acquisition and exploit strategy. Organic exploration is an important competitive advantage for EOG, and we see significant opportunities ahead of us. 
Last but not least is EOG's organization and culture. This is the catalyst for the first 4 drivers and underpins our competitive advantage. A decentralized structure encourages asset level, bottom-up decision-making, which leads to better execution. Our core culture is return driven. Employee performance is incentivized by rate of return, which is a key driver to our share [ph] leading return on capital employed. Return-based decision-making and incentives drives EOG's success. 
The second item I would cover today is our plan for the remainder of 2015. We are maintaining total company oil production guidance while reducing 2015 CapEx guidance by approximately $200 million. In addition, our projected year-end uncompleted well inventory has increased from 285 to 320. The bottom line is productivity improvements and reduced cost are allowing us to produce more oil with less capital. Many of you are asking, ""When will EOG grow oil again?"" We have said all along that we do not want to grow production until we see the oil market is firmly rebalancing. We will be watching the supply demand fundamentals in the second half of this year closely as we determine our plan for 2016. Currently, we intend to spend within cash flow. The capital efficiency gains we've made this year, along with our large high-quality inventory of uncompleted wells, positions us for an excellent 2016. 
My #1 message is this: we're resetting the economics of our business. EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We expect EOG to remain the lowest cost U.S. shale producer and competitive in the world oil market. 
I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss the update on our Bakken resource estimates as well as other activities in the Rockies."
269660,306412228,2472597,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.",597,"Thanks, Bill. We were pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1,500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent that have remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. 
In addition to the updated resource estimates, we split the Bakken into 2 categories that we have titled core acreage and noncore acreage. The core produces returns that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope Extension. Noncore represents acreage in the Bakken Lite, State Line and Elm Coulee areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area, we believe that with modern high-density completions and current well costs, the noncore acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. 
We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Noncore acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage, we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 net drilling locations, which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102-32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope Extension we have drilled using a high-density completion. The well came online with a maximum rate of 3,395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic feet of rich natural gas. With an average rate of 2,760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4,300-foot lateral will be the highest-rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high-density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. 
In addition to improved returns to advance completions, we've made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well costs, which are now $7.1 million for an 8,400-foot treated lateral. This is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions and therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days spud to TD for an 8,400-foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently, we are averaging more than 10 completion stages per day, up from 4 to 5 stages per day in 2014. In addition, plug drill-out times have been cut in half since 2014. 
Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result, we have seen dramatic LOE reductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential and drilling inventory illustrates the value of EOG's exploration and technology leadership. We enter plays as the first mover and capture the best assets, then we grow them through the drill bit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. 
Here's Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford."

The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well cost. In the case of improved productivity, we are finding that wellbore targeting, along with our integrated completion approach, continues to provide upside on well performance. 
In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the Second Bone Spring Sand, testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State #501H and 502H, were completed in a 1,000-foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1,075 and 1,755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com #501H, tested 1,705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The completed well costs for the Second Bone Spring Sand are currently averaging $6 million per well, representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance, coupled with lower well cost, make this play very attractive in this low commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. 
During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the overpressured oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County, New Mexico, the Dragon 36 State #701H and the Hearns 27 State Com #703H, had initial production rates per well of 2,650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various targets and spacing patterns, this play promises to be a high-return growth asset for EOG. 
Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now costs $5.5 million and we are testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells. One recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Gem 36 State Com #1H, had an initial production rate of 2,200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. 
Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOG's long-term growth. As typical with our other plays, EOG is -- will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating costs to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOG's Delaware Basin properties. 
Now moving to the Eagle Ford, which continues to be our workhorse asset. Due to the sheer scale of our operations there, it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high-density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled 4 pilot wells to gather additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific target's variability across the play. We are currently conducting tests using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford, and the new data we've gathered on the targets is encouraging, as it supports our expectations for success. 
While it's too early to share results, we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress of cost-reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high-density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance, through the application of technology, is ensuring that this world-class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.2 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $85 million. 
At the end of June 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5 billion for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 22%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. In July, we successfully entered into a new $2 billion credit agreement to replace the existing one, which would've matured in October 2016. Terms of the new agreement were similar to the prior credit agreement. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 146%, and current tax expense was $41 million. For the period August 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swaps contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. For the second -- I'm sorry, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties.

Low oil prices are slowing supply growth and encouraging demand worldwide. We believe U.S. oil production will have significant month-over-month declines in the second half of this year. So our assessment is, there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. 
In summary, before we open up the call for Q&A, I want to talk about the core fundamentals that defined EOG's strategy for creating long-term shareholder value. The first core fundamental is that EOG is return-driven. We allocate capital in order to earn the highest returns. As we've done for many years, our goal is to be the peer leader in capital returns. Our second core fundamental is organic growth. Growing through the drill bit is the most return-friendly and therefore, shareholder-friendly means of growth. Our goal is to be the leader in organic U.S. oil growth. The third core fundamental is a strong balance sheet. Our goal is to maintain a disciplined spending program that keeps our net debt low and liquidity strong. Finally, the fourth core fundamental is commitment to the dividend. Our track record indicates our continued commitment to the dividend. Staying focused on these 4 core fundamentals, return-driven, organic growth, strong balance sheet and commitment to the dividend is how EOG consistently delivers long-term shareholder value.

And the data does not -- as we know, not precise and it gets updated over time. So what we really need to see to confirm this is the July and August monthly data. And that'll come in, in September and October. So hopefully by that time, the declines will be a bit more evident to everybody. And if that happens, we could see a bit more firmness in the price. So our model shows, by what everybody is guiding, that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the 1.2 million barrels a day last year, so there's a significant drop off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the -- if prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month-over-month decline rates in the U.S. and that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OPEC supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly, that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market. The other thing is certainly is that we just can't see a good business reason to outspend growing oil in an oversupplied oil market. That just does not make sense to us, so we believe we made the right decision."

That's a good question, Doug. The company is set up for exceptionally strong performance in 2016. And the capital required for growth in 2016 is considerably lower than we had in the previous years. Number one, as you note",425,"Let me give you a good overview. That's a good question, Doug. The company is set up for exceptionally strong performance in 2016. And the capital required for growth in 2016 is considerably lower than we had in the previous years. Number one, as you noted, we've gotten -- we've achieved very strong efficiency gains on the capital by lowering the cost, by baking better wells through technology. And we're going to be able to continue that process in the second half of the year and really reap the benefits of that in 2016. And the second thing is that as we talked about, we have a very large, now 320 estimate, 320 uncompleted well inventory that will be very high quality. I think it'll be the highest-quality inventory of any operator in the U.S. And that inventory is ready to complete -- to begin completion early in the year, next year. We have infrastructure in place for all that uncompleted inventory, so that won't slow us down. And then we're making significant improvements in lowering decline rates in a number of different ways. The first one is we continue to drill our laterals in better rock. We're drilling -- we're taking a lot of time and effort, picking out the best quality rock in each one of these plays and keeping the lateral in that longer. And then when we -- and to execute that well is very important. And when we do that, we now are doing a much better job with the high-density fracs, better distributing the frac along the lateral, connecting it more with that good rock, and it's certainly lowering our decline rates over time and that makes it easier to grow production. And the last thing, which is very important, we have tremendous capital flexibility in 2016. We don't have many service or rig contracts that will be in place as we begin 2016. We have very few lease retention requirements and we have very few international commitments. So we're fully flexible to concentrate our capital, particularly in the first half of the year on this very high-quality uncompleted well inventory. We're not going to give any specific guidance on our CapEx until February next year. We want to work the details. And so we're just going to -- we'll make our CapEx plan based on what the 2016 forward curve looks like in February. And we're going to remain patient and really run our business right, and continue to focus on improving the returns as we go forward."

And so the fracs are not competing with each other for production. So we used to think, and it's really been a shift in thinking, we used to think that these big fracs just connected up a lot of rock both laterally and vertically.

The Bone Springs probably has the biggest relative increase in capital this year. We completed quite a few wells in the first half. And then the Wolfcamp, we'll be completing more wells in the second half of the year than we have in the first half. But in general, the Wolfcamp, we're still learning a lot about it. We've got quite a few target zones we're testing. We're testing various areas of the Wolfcamp play where we have acreage, and we're testing some various spacing patterns. So we still have a lot to learn about the Wolfcamp. And the other thing we're doing is with the Wolfcamp being in the deeper target, we're gathering additional data on the Leonard and Bone Springs pay zones when we drill down through those on our way to the Wolfcamp. So by gathering additional petrophysical data and rock data, we're better able to look at the variability of the pay sections in those 2 shallower pay zones and gives us a better idea about how to develop those, how to better target those and where the best upside might be. So it's kind of an overall approach to understand the play better, and that's one of the reasons we've -- a major reason we've shifted more to the Wolfcamp."

And EOG had much less emphasis on production and reserve growth than did peers. And I assume, obviously, that feeds into your decision to build the DUC inventory in the second half of this year higher than what you originally thought, and be restrained on production because of the lower price environment that we're in. However, earlier on the call, you stated that you would not have '16 production decline year-over-year at the current strip. And so if the returns for '16 aren't that great, and your compensation structure doesn't tell you to push production, why wouldn't you employ the same strategy in '16 as you're employing in the second half of this year? Or is there a mechanical reason why you don't want production to decline? Is it problematic? Or is it just strictly cash flow needs?"

Because in the plays -- go ahead, Irene? I was just going to say yes, you look through those various plays and we reduced our days from anywhere from, oh goodness, 15% to 30% and of course, that translates to cost.

And the completion approach varies on each one of those, and the spacing approach might vary on each one of those.

It looks like the decline for EOG was less a function of fewer workovers, but rather a significant decline on the O&M front. You've referenced the impact of new infrastructure in the core of the lowest end. But can you maybe talk about which components of O&M you're seeing cost declines and how much of those savings are secular versus cyclical?"
