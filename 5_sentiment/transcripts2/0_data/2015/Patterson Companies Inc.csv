Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call. During the third quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic growth plan by enriching our product and service offerings, pursuing efficiencies, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.
I am pleased to say that we made significant progress on all of these fronts. The first half of fiscal 2015 was strong for Patterson. And despite flat revenues in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, we are on track to meet our financial objectives as we move towards the end of our fiscal year. Most importantly, we are confident in the strength of our business and encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing.
As detailed in today's earning release, Patterson Companies' consolidated revenues totaled $1.1 billion, which is roughly flat compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date basis are consolidated of sales are up 8.9% to $3.2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 during the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period, excluding medical unit restructuring costs. The 3 quarters earnings per diluted share have risen to $1.59 from $1.50 a year ago. As Ann will note later in the call, EPS in last year's third quarter benefited from a onetime non-cash stock compensation adjustment.
During the quarter, we saw several positive macro trends and made strides in all 3 of our business units. Let's take a closer look at our operational performance starting with Patterson Dental.
Dental was -- is our largest business, represents about 58% of our total sales. On the consumable side of Dental, we once again posted solid growth with sales rising 4% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. We believe this reflects a combination of higher office visits and overall demand for dental services and the ability of our industry-leading sales force to meet the needs of our dental customers. Consumable growth continues to be supported by a steadily improving job market and consumer confidence.
On the equipment and software side of the business, we experienced a headwind driven by the uncertainty around the reinstatement of Section 179 tax benefits. This was a risk we foreshadowed in our second quarter conference call. Virtually, the entire shortfall to our internal plan occurred from early November to the December 19th time period when Congress finally reinstated the tax benefits. From December 19th to the end of the quarter, our equipment business performed at planned levels, but it could not make up for the shortfall created by the delay. We feel this was an industry-wide issue and do not see any change to our growth outlook for equipment and technology in our fourth quarter or in our new fiscal year beginning in May.
Clearly, our folks our partnership with equipment manufacturers are a key factor in our success at Patterson. During the quarter, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell in the basic dental equipment space. With the support of our long-time strategic partner, , we have built the reputation as a leader in selling dental equipment in North America. We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with and see many years of growth opportunities ahead for both companies. In the coming months, we will announce new relationships that will expand the offering we bring to our des. We have already noted the broadening of our relationship with Sirona to over time introduce their market-leading treatment centers to the United States market. We are excited to work with our partners to bring innovative products that enhance the productivity gains that technology affords our customers.
Patterson Dental is on the leading edge of the technology trends digitization of the dental office. We believe that fundamentals are in place for continued growth. Our exceptional sales, training and technical support infrastructure all position us well to capitalize on the digitization trend as it builds further momentum.
Technology investments continue to be at the top of the dentists wish list. Tax simplification aside, demand for CEREC CAD/CAM units remain healthy, and we are helping dental offices adopt and deploy this technology. As I have stated many times before, we believe that the CEREC CAD/CAM platform truly has the potential to become the standard of care in dentistry.
In early January, we held a meeting in Minneapolis with roughly 400 Patterson branch managers, CEREC specialists, equipment specialist and CIRCOR representatives. The objective was to lay out our company goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users with 2020. This would double the CEREC user base in North America in the next 5 years. We will continue to work closely with Sirona to develop strategies to accomplish this goal. We will do everything in our power in terms of sales, marketing and support infrastructure to help accelerate this tremendous opportunity.
As we have highlighted on the past several calls, we are committed to further expanding our product and service offerings for our dental customers. In December, we acquired dental supply located near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This acquisition will help accelerate Patterson Dental's reach and deepen our Midwest influence. We are in delighted to welcome Whole Dental to Patterson Companies as they bring a long-standing and stellar reputation in their markets and maintain a culture much like ours, focused on accountability, integrity and customer service.
Moving on to Patterson Veterinary, which compromises [ph] just under 1/3 of our total sales. We believe the underlying market in veterinary continues to perform well. We are well positioned in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in their pets continues to grow. You'll recall that our go-forward strategy for Patterson Veterinary is to further diversify our equipment and technical service offerings to capitalize on the favorable marketplace dynamics. Patterson brings market-leading technical service and support capabilities as well as the premier sales force.
Pet consumables increased by 3.5% in the quarter and were impacted by a sales mix shift in pharmaceutical products sold under arrangements to those sold under agency arrangements. We are confident in our manufacturing partners' commitment to invest in innovation and are optimistic that this, along with the promising pet ownership trends, will continue to benefit Patterson Veterinary.
On the equipment side of vet, sales increased 3.5%. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator as we further drive our strategy to provide unique services that support the success of our vet customers.
We are still early in our transition from to our new strategic ownership with but we are off to a good start and are pleased with Abaxis' placements to date. Abaxis is a leading manufacturer of point-of-care blood and consumables to the veterinary market as well as to medical and research customers. We are selling Abaxis' full line of veterinary diagnostics products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited about Abaxis' products and people and are committed to securing the success of this new partnership.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, and we have made significant progress here. This business represents approximately 10% of our total company revenues. Our management team has worked hard to sharpen the focus of this business on select rehab markets, and those efforts are paying off. We are pleased that Medical delivered its third consecutive quarter of growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts. We are confident that our restructuring has created a strong platform and momentum in the business.
We are the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. Our team is executing well against its strategic plans. We remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share as the underlying market conditions continue to stabilize. We're optimistic at Patterson that we will finish the year strong with momentum heading into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,283806570,765709,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Nationally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2",835,"Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Nationally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2 percentage points for currency.
Turning to each of our segments beginning with Dental, sales were down 2.6% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. In Dental, as Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our continued growth. After a strong second quarter in equipment, sales were affected in the fiscal third quarter by the late of tax incentive for equipment purchases.
Looking at Veterinary. As a reminder, our NVS acquisition closed more than a year ago. So those results are now considered organic. Vet sales were $337.8 million, [ph] up 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, U.S. sales declined 1.9% and the U.K. sales rose 10.4% in local currency. Total Vet revenues include several items. First, as you are aware, products direct to the customers on January 1. We are replacing those products with Abaxis lines, but this does caused some disruption in the channel. That said, we are confident in the strength of our Abaxis partnership, as Scott said.
Additionally, Vet sales in the quarter reflect the impact of changes in selling arrangements on certain products from agency on the pharmaceutical end of the business.
Regarding Medical, this unit performed well. As Scott noted, sales in the quarter were up 2.6%, excluding currency and divestiture impact.
Looking at margins. Consolidated gross margin was 28.5%, down 40 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 third quarter. This reflects the impact of revenue mix with lower margin veterinary revenues outpacing U.S. dental revenues.
We are pleased with our cost control efforts during the quarter. Operating expenses on an absolute basis declined by $2.5 million. On a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of the medical divestiture, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal third quarter was 19.9%, which is in line with last year's level.
To help understand margin performance, it is useful to adjust for last year's impact of the medical divestiture as well as the onetime noncash stock-based compensation adjustment, most of which was in the dental business. On this basis, consolidated operating margin expanded 20 basis points. By segment, they were improved in both Dental and Medical and were flat in Veterinary. Specifically, operating margins for the quarter were 10.7% in Dental, 3.5% in Veterinary and 11.6% for Medical.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8% versus 35.2% in the prior year. We continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. [ph] This will be in line with our annual tax rate for fiscal 2014.
Our DSO stands at 50 days, up 4 days from a year ago, reflecting the lower mix of equipment sales, which are typically not financed through our trade receivables.
Our inventory turns were at 6.7 compared to 6.5 a year ago.
Also, please keep in mind a few additional items on the balance sheet. A year ago, we bought both a 1-year time deposit and a 2-year guaranteed investment contracts or GIC totaling approximately $100 million. Both are similar to certificate of deposit. When the 1-year time deposit matures, the balance transferred to cash. And at the same time, the 2-year GCI move from long-term assets.
Cash flow for the fiscal 2015 third quarter was basically flat at $59.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $158 million, up from roughly $150 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014.
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately $20.2 million for shareholders in dividends. As you know, Patterson has $250 million of debt that is due in March. We are moving forward with a long-term extension of this debt facility. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.
Our CapEx in the third quarter totaled $14.3 million and included payments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. For the fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items that affect our fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Our performance in last year's fourth quarter was hurt by unusually adverse winter weather condition and our utilization for customers. Also, please keep in mind that we took a noncash cash -- I'm sorry, we took a nonrecurring severance charge in last year's fourth quarter. We're confident in our ability to close the year strong.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

We have made significant strides with our corporate-wide information strategy initiative, which is moving into the pilot phase. Our information technology investments are critical to improving scale in our business platform.
We have momentum at Patterson Medical, putting this business, like our others, on solid footing for future growth and market share gains. Lastly, the leadership position on an issue we care deeply about to help protect against potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace. In January, we announced that we are formalizing our efforts to promote supply chain integrity for our dental customers. We will share more details at next week's Chicago Dental midwinter meeting. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the of supply chain of our dental customers.
Now with that, we'd like to take questions. I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

We're very excited about the opportunity ahead with CEREC and believe we're at a very interesting time with the technology and with the marketplace. And I really look at the opportunity around 3 areas, and it will touch on your questions. #1 is the customer. We're really dealing with the next-generation of dentists that are embracing digital dentistry. Each year, those millennials become a bigger part of the decision-making part of the customer base. So we look at that as a big factor in driving future utilization. The second one is a big one is the product. Sirona just continues to innovate. You talked about the ortho expansion. And I think you'll see more things come out of Sirona that help expand all of the things that the CEREC machine can do for the customer and for the specialist going forward. Each improvement with CEREC, it becomes easier, faster, and it just produces better and better dentistry. And I would also add you have the materials innovations as well. The last part, and that's our part at Patterson and that's sales execution. So in terms of our commitment, our sales force is absolutely motivated, engaged in their role in helping change dentistry. And we also are willing to invest to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support the aftersales support for our customers. I would say that this goal is very important to everyone in this organization because at Patterson, we're committed to being one of the many catalysts that helps CEREC reach a tipping point in the market and become the long-term standard of care in dentistry."

We believe we're on target to achieve probably around 20 basis points of margin expansion this year because where we had a tough comp in operating margins year-over-year this quarter, we actually have an easier comp coming up in fourth quarter because of, A, the weather, B, we took that onetime severance charge last quarter. So current year, we should end up with some modest margin expansion. Looking forward to FY '16, we continue to see opportunities to improve even forward as we continue to drive operating efficiencies within the organization. And I would -- depending on the revenue levels and where the market is, we would target 20 to 50 [ph] basis points higher than that if the revenues can accelerate."

To the Sirona opportunity, we think there's a real nice opportunity at the higher end of the market.

If there could be a potential really nice tailwind, if the Section 179 is reinstated at a time like it usually is, which is usually early fall, we could see a very active equipment market next year in the calendar fourth quarter, the November, December period, particularly against the backdrop order where our dentists are getting busier, which means their practices are performing well.

When I pick out the ESOP, so up just slightly. Rising just in terms of the consumable mix, you're right, you'd expect that to drop through because of the equipment. What I would tell you is that as a result of the equipment being lower, our financing income was also lower, which is pretty profitable so it's kind of a double whammy when we have a reduction equipment.

We now have almost 16,000 CEREC users in the U.S. and Canada and have an incredibly low return rate. And consistently, what you see is while it is at a high ASP, there probably is no piece of equipment that brings a higher return to the practice and more patient satisfaction in terms of a single visit.

Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic growth plan by enriching our product and service offerings, pursuing efficiencies, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.
I am pleased to say that we made significant progress on all of these fronts. The first half of fiscal 2015 was strong for Patterson. And despite flat revenues in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, we are on track to meet our financial objectives as we move towards the end of our fiscal year. Most importantly, we are confident in the strength of our business and encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing.
As detailed in today's earning release, Patterson Companies' consolidated revenues totaled $1.1 billion, which is roughly flat compared to the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated sales are up 8.9% to $3.2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 during the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period, excluding Medical unit restructuring costs. With 3 quarters, earnings per diluted share have risen to $1.59 from $1.50 a year ago. As Ann will note later in the call, EPS in last year's third quarter benefited from a onetime noncash stock compensation adjustment.
During the quarter, we saw several positive macro trends and made strides in all 3 of our business units. Let's take a closer look at our operational performance, starting with Patterson Dental.
Dental is our largest business, represents about 58% of our total sales. On the consumable side of Dental, we once again posted solid growth with sales rising 4% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. We believe this reflects a combination of higher office visits and overall demand for dental services and the ability of our industry-leading sales force to meet the needs of our dental customers. Consumable growth continues to be supported by a steadily improving job market and consumer confidence.
On the equipment and software side of the business, we experienced a headwind driven by the uncertainty around the reinstatement of Section 179 tax benefits. This was a risk we foreshadowed in our second quarter conference call. Virtually, the entire shortfall to our internal plan occurred from early November to the December 19th time period when Congress finally reinstated the tax benefits. From December 19th to the end of the quarter, our equipment business performed at planned levels, but it could not make up for the shortfall created by the delay. We feel this was an industry-wide issue and do not see any change to our growth outlook for equipment and technology in our fourth quarter or in our new fiscal year beginning in May.
Clearly, our partnership with equipment manufacturers are a key factor in our success at Patterson. During the quarter, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell in the basic dental equipment space. With the support of our long-time strategic partner, A-dec, we have built a reputation as the leader in selling dental equipment in North America. We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with A-dec and seeing many years of growth opportunities ahead for both companies. In the coming months, we will announce new relationships that will expand the offering we bring to our dentists. We have already noted the broadening of our relationship with Sirona to, over time, introduce their market-leading treatment centers to the United States market. We are excited to work with our partners to bring innovative products that enhance the productivity gains that technology affords our customers.
Patterson Dental is on the leading edge of the technology trends, the digitization of the dental office. We believe that fundamentals are in place for a continued growth. Our exceptional sales, training and technical support infrastructure all position us well to capitalize on the digitization trend as it builds further momentum.
Technology investments continue to be at the top of dentist wish list. Tax implications aside, demand for CEREC CAD/CAM units remains healthy, and we are helping dental offices adopt and deploy this technology. As I have stated many times before, we believe that the CEREC care-side CAD/CAM platform truly has the potential to become the standard of care in dentistry.
In early January, we held a meeting in Minneapolis with roughly 400 Patterson branch managers, CEREC specialists, equipment specialist and territory representatives. The objective was to lay out our company goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020. This would double the CEREC user base in North America in the next 5 years. We will continue to work closely with Sirona to develop strategies to accomplish this goal. We will do everything in our power in terms of sales, marketing and support infrastructure to help accelerate this tremendous opportunity.
As we have highlighted on the past several calls, we are committed to further expanding our product and service offerings for our dental customers. In December, we acquired Holt Dental Supply located near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This acquisition will help accelerate Patterson Dental's reach and deepen our Midwest influence. We are delighted to welcome Holt Dental to Patterson Companies as they bring a long-standing and stellar reputation in their markets and maintain a culture much like ours, focused on accountability, integrity and customer service.
Moving on to Patterson Veterinary, which compromises [ph] just under 1/3 of our total sales. We believe the underlying market in veterinary continues to perform well. We are well positioned in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in vet care for their pets continues to grow. You'll recall that our go-forward strategy for Patterson Veterinary is to further diversify our equipment and technical service offerings to capitalize on the favorable marketplace dynamics. Patterson brings market-leading technical service and support capabilities as well as the premier sales force.
Pet consumables increased by 3.5% in the quarter and were impacted by a sales mix shift in pharmaceutical products sold under buy-sell arrangements to those sold under agency arrangements. We are confident in our manufacturing partners' commitment to invest in an innovation and are optimistic that this, along with the promising pet ownership trends, will continue to benefit Patterson Veterinary.
On the equipment side of vet, sales increased 3.5%. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator as we further drive our strategy to provide unique services that support the success of our vet customers.
We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to our new strategic ownership with Abaxis. But we are off to a good start and are pleased with Abaxis' placements today. Abaxis is a leading manufacturer of point-of-care blood, instrumentation and consumables to the veterinary market as well as to medical and research customers. We are selling Abaxis' full line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited about Abaxis' products and people and are committed to securing the success of this new partnership.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, and we have made significant progress here. This business represents approximately 10% of our total company revenues. Our management team has worked hard to sharpen the focus of this business on select rehab markets, and those efforts are paying off. We are pleased that Medical delivered its third consecutive quarter of growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts. We are confident that our restructuring has created a strong platform and momentum in the business.
We are the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. Our team is executing well against this strategic plan. We remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share as the underlying market conditions continue to stabilize. We are optimistic at Patterson that we will finish the year strong with momentum heading into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,283806570,766093,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2",847,"Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2 percentage points for currency.
Turning to each of our segments beginning with Dental, sales were down 2.6% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. In Dental, as Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our continued consumable growth. After a strong second quarter in equipment, sales were affected in the fiscal third quarter by the late reinstatement of tax incentives for equipment purchases.
Looking at Veterinary. As a reminder, our NVS acquisition closed more than a year ago. So those results are now considered organic. Vet sales were $337.8 million, up 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, U.S. sales declined 1.9% and the U.K. sales rose 10.4% in local currency. Total Vet revenues include several items. First, as you are aware, IDEXX ships the products direct to the customers on January 1. We are replacing those products with Abaxis lines, but this does caused some disruption in the channel. That said, we are confident in the strength of our Abaxis partnership, as Scott said.
Additionally, Vet sales in the quarter reflect the impact of changes in selling arrangements on certain products from buy-sell to agency on the pharmaceutical end of the business. Regarding Medical, this unit performed well, as Scott noted. Sales in the quarter were up 2.6%, excluding currency and divestiture impact.
Looking at margins. Consolidated gross margin was 28.5%, down 40 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 third quarter. This reflects the impact of revenue mix with lower margin veterinary revenues outpacing U.S. dental revenues.
We are pleased with our cost control efforts during the quarter. Operating expenses on an absolute basis declined by $2.5 million. On a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of the medical divestiture, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal third quarter was 19.9%, which is in line with last year's level.
To help understand margin performance, it is useful to adjust for last year's impact of the medical divestiture as well as the onetime noncash stock-based compensation adjustment, most of which was in the dental business. On this basis, consolidated operating margin expanded 20 basis points. By segment, they were improved in both Dental and Medical and were flat in Veterinary. Specifically, operating margins for the quarter were 10.7% in Dental, 3.5% in Veterinary and 11.6% for Medical.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8% versus 35.2% in the prior year. We continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. This will be in line with our annual tax rate for fiscal 2014.
Our DSO stands at 50 days, up 4 days from a year ago, reflecting the lower mix of equipment sales, which are typically not financed through our trade receivables. Our inventory turns were at 6.7 compared to 6.5 a year ago.
Also, please keep in mind a few additional items on the balance sheet. A year ago, we bought both a 1-year time deposit and a 2-year guaranteed investment contracts or GIC totaling approximately $100 million. Both are similar to certificate of deposit. When the 1-year time deposit matures, the balance transfer to cash. And at the same time, the 2-year GCI moved from long-term to current assets.
Cash flow for the fiscal 2015 third quarter was basically flat at $59.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $158 million, up from roughly $150 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014.
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately $20.2 million for shareholders in dividends. As you know, Patterson has $250 million of debt that is due in March. We are moving forward with a long-term extension of this debt facility. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.
Our CapEx in the third quarter totaled $14.3 million and included payments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. For the fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items that affect our fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Our performance in last year's fourth quarter was hurt by unusually adverse winter weather conditions and their resulting impact on utilization rates for our customers. Also, please keep in mind that we took a noncash cash -- I'm sorry, we took a nonrecurring severance charge in last year's fourth quarter. We're confident in our ability to close the year strong.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

We have made significant strides with our corporate-wide information technology initiative, which is moving into the pilot phase. Our information technology investments are critical to improving scale in our business platform.
We have momentum at Patterson Medical, putting this business, like our others, on solid footing for future growth and market share gains. Lastly, we took the leadership position on an issue we care deeply about. To help protect against potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace, in January, we announced that we are formalizing our efforts to promote supply chain integrity for our dental customers. We will share more details at next week's Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the integrity of our supply chain for our dental customers.
Now with that, we'd like to take questions. I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

We're very excited about the opportunity ahead with CEREC and believe we're at a very interesting time with the technology and with the marketplace.

We're really dealing with the next-generation of dentists that are embracing digital dentistry. Each year, those millennials become a bigger part of the decision-making part of the customer base. So we look at that as a big factor in driving future utilization. The second one is a big one, is the product. Sirona just continues to innovate. You talked about the ortho expansion.

Each improvement with CEREC, it becomes easier, faster and it just produces better and better dentistry. And I would also add you have the materials innovations as well. Now the last part, and that's our part at Patterson and that's sales execution. So in terms of our commitment, our sales force is absolutely motivated, engaged in their role in helping change dentistry. And we also are willing to invest to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support the aftersales support for our customers. I would say that this goal is very important to everyone in this organization because at Patterson, we're committed to being one of the many catalysts that help CEREC reach a tipping point in the market and become the long-term standard of care in dentistry."

But when we look going forward, now that we've kind of fully integrated the NVS acquisition, what should we think about in terms of the margin trajectory from here? And as we look into fiscal '16, I mean, do you think that we will see operating margins expand?"

In the current quarter, in addition to a sales issue, I would also highlight it's really a comp issue with the prior year quarter where we had some onetime adjustments. And then I would also just point out that year-to-date, excluding the incremental impact from NVS, our operating margins are flat. So we're pleased with the progress we're making this year. We believe we're on target to achieve probably around 20 basis points of margin expansion this year because where we had a tough comp in operating margins year-over-year this quarter, we actually have an easier comp coming up in fourth quarter because of, A, the weather headwinds, and then B, we took that onetime severance charge last quarter. So current year, we should end up with some modest margin expansion. Looking forward to FY '16, we continue to see opportunities to improve even further moving forward as we continue to drive operating efficiencies within the organization. And I would -- depending on the revenue levels and where the market is, we would target 20 to [indiscernible] basis points higher than that if the revenues can accelerate."

To the Sirona opportunity, we think there's a real nice opportunity at the higher end of the market. When you look at many of our customers who currently own CEREC machines or GALILEOS machines that are looking for tight integration of technology, those are products that we feel the United States and Canadian markets are absolutely ready for and are excited about the opportunity ahead.

In fact, I think your colleague, Elizabeth, asked me the question last quarter about guidance. And I sort of talked about strength in consumables and if we had a strong third quarter in equipment, that would push us to the upper end and we would be able to mitigate any softness. So that absolutely goes back to how we plan out the year.

Just as I adjust for the stock option expense and, I think, the ESOP issue in that from last year that created the tough comp this quarter, once I adjust for those it still looks like to me the dental margins were kind of flat in a quarter where consumables were up nicely and equipment down. I'm just having trouble kind of reconciling that. And even in vet, I'm having a little trouble understanding if the shift to agency should help margins, but those margins even adjusting for the stock option issues look flat to down in the quarter. Are you just -- can you help me out why the margin is down in periods where both those segments should've been helped?"

I think there's a lot of moving pieces in the margin, so let me just take your questions 1 by 1. As it relates to the vet segment, I think what you're seeing there is just a mix between NVS and U.S. vets on the consolidated rates. So we're up about 1",202,"Yes. I think there's a lot of moving pieces in the margin, so let me just take your questions 1 by 1. As it relates to the vet segment, I think what you're seeing there is just a mix between NVS and U.S. vets on the consolidated rates. So we're up about 10 basis points over prior year consolidated. But if you look at the individual segments, which you can't see, both are up. So it's really a mix issue because NVS growth outpaced the U.S. growth this quarter. As it relates to the U.S., we might need take that off-line and just take a look at your math because I show that we're actually up on an operating margin in the dental business. When I pick out the ESOP, so up just slightly. I think in terms of the consumable mix, you're right. You'd expect that to drop through because of the equipment. What I would tell you is that as a result of the equipment being lower, our financing income was also lower, which is pretty profitable. So it's kind of a double whammy when we have a reduction in equipment. So my guess is that's where the delta is."

And then, Scott, I guess, just 1 bigger picture question on the CEREC doubling that penetration here over the next 5 years, which I think we'd all like to see happen. But every survey we've done, every survey we've ever seen kind of points to pricing as the biggest hurdle on CEREC selling $100,000 box. To double that penetration, at least by our math, it looks like you'd have to literally increase your annual penetration by 3 to fourfold. So that's a huge move. For that to happen, do think you can do it, selling the high-end CEREC system north of $100,000 or does that have to come down? Just -- it's a big move and I guess, I'm struggling to see how you make that move at these pricing dynamics, things like that."

But at the same time, this is going to be an evolving market over the next 5 years. You're going to see a lot of innovation come out of Sirona. It is interesting because we do have products at multiple price points currently, and still well over 95% of our sales are at the high end because of the feature and benefits of the Omnicam and the full chairside complement as well as the return on investment. We now have almost 16,000 CEREC users in the U.S. and Canada and have an incredibly low return rate. And consistently, what you'd see is while it is at a high ASP, there probably is no piece of equipment a dentist can invest in that brings a higher return to the practice and more patient satisfaction in terms of a single visit. So there's absolutely challenges in us not only accelerating to that type of rate of getting to 2,000, to 3,000, to 4,000 CEREC sales a year. But at the same time, if you look at tipping points and adoptions of technologies, CEREC is right at that point, where we believe that this technology is absolutely the future and can take off. And we're going to do everything on our end to make that happen."

Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic growth plan by enriching our product and service offerings, pursuing efficiencies, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.
I am pleased to say that we made significant progress on all of these fronts. The first half of fiscal 2015 was strong for Patterson. And despite flat revenues in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, we are on track to meet our financial objectives as we move towards the end of our fiscal year. Most importantly, we are confident in the strength of our business and encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing.
As detailed in today's earning release, Patterson Companies' consolidated revenues totaled $1.1 billion, which is roughly flat compared to the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated sales are up 8.9% to $3.2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 during the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period, excluding Medical unit restructuring costs. Through 3 quarters, earnings per diluted share have risen to $1.59 from $1.50 a year ago. As Ann will note later in the call, EPS in last year's third quarter benefited from a onetime noncash stock compensation adjustment.
During the quarter, we saw several positive macro trends and made strides in all 3 of our business units. Let's take a closer look at our operational performance, starting with Patterson Dental.
Dental is our largest business, represents about 58% of our total sales. On the consumable side of dental, we once again posted solid growth with sales rising 4% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. We believe this reflects a combination of higher office visits and overall demand for dental services and the ability of our industry-leading sales force to meet the needs of our dental customers. Consumable growth continues to be supported by a steadily improving job market and consumer confidence.
On the equipment and software side of the business, we experienced a headwind driven by the uncertainty around the reinstatement of Section 179 tax benefits. This was a risk we foreshadowed in our second quarter conference call. Virtually, the entire shortfall to our internal plan occurred from early November to the December 19 time period when Congress finally reinstated the tax benefits. From December 19 to the end of the quarter, our equipment business performed at planned levels, but it could not make up for the shortfall created by the delay. We feel this was an industry-wide issue and do not see any change to our growth outlook for equipment and technology in our fourth quarter or in our new fiscal year beginning in May.
Clearly, our partnerships with equipment manufacturers are a key factor in our success at Patterson. During the quarter, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell in the basic dental equipment space. With the support of our long-time strategic partner, A-dec, we have built a reputation as the leader in selling dental equipment in North America. We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with A-dec and see many years of growth opportunities ahead for both companies. In the coming months, we will announce new relationships that will expand the offering we bring to our dentists. We have already noted the broadening of our relationship with Sirona to, over time, introduce their market-leading treatment centers to the United States market. We are excited to work with our partners to bring innovative products that enhance the productivity gains that technology affords our customers.
Patterson Dental is on the leading edge of the technology trends, the digitization of the dental office. We believe that fundamentals are in place for continued growth. Our exceptional sales, training and technical support infrastructure all position us well to capitalize on the digitization trend as it builds further momentum.
Technology investments continue to be at the top of dentists' wish lists. Tax implications aside, demand for CEREC CAD/CAM units remains healthy, and we are helping dental offices adopt and deploy this technology. As I have stated many times before, we believe that the CEREC chairside CAD/CAM platform truly has the potential to become the standard of care in dentistry.
In early January, we held a meeting in Minneapolis with roughly 400 Patterson branch managers, CEREC specialists, equipment specialists and territory representatives. The objective was to lay out our company goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020. This would double the CEREC user base in North America in the next 5 years. We will continue to work closely with Sirona to develop strategies to accomplish this goal. We will do everything in our power in terms of sales, marketing and support infrastructure to help accelerate this tremendous opportunity.
As we have highlighted on the past several calls, we are committed to further expanding our product and service offerings for our dental customers. In December, we acquired Holt Dental Supply located near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This acquisition will help accelerate Patterson Dental's reach and deepen our Midwest influence. We are delighted to welcome Holt Dental to Patterson Companies as they bring a long-standing and stellar reputation in their markets and maintain a culture much like ours, focused on accountability, integrity and customer service.
Moving on to Patterson Veterinary, which compromises (sic) [comprises] just under 1/3 of our total sales. We believe the underlying market in veterinary continues to perform well. We are well positioned in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in vet care for their pets continues to grow. You'll recall that our go-forward strategy for Patterson Veterinary is to further diversify our equipment and technical service offerings to capitalize on the favorable marketplace dynamics. Patterson brings market-leading technical service and support capabilities as well as the premier sales force.
Pet consumables increased by 3.5% in the quarter and were impacted by a sales mix shift in pharmaceutical products sold under buy-sell arrangements to those sold under agency arrangements. We are confident in our manufacturing partners' commitment to investing in innovation and are optimistic that this, along with the promising pet ownership trends, will continue to benefit Patterson Veterinary.
On the equipment side of vet, sales increased 3.5%. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator as we further drive our strategy to provide unique services that support the success of our vet customers.
We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to our new strategic partnership with Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with Abaxis' placements today. Abaxis is a leading manufacturer of point-of-care blood, instrumentation and consumables to the veterinary market as well as to medical and research customers. We are selling Abaxis' full line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited about Abaxis' products and people and are committed to securing the success of this new partnership.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, and we have made significant progress here. This business represents approximately 10% of our total company revenues. Our management team has worked hard to sharpen the focus of this business on select rehab markets, and those efforts are paying off. We are pleased that Medical delivered its third consecutive quarter of growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts. We are confident that our restructuring has created a strong platform and momentum in the business.
We are the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. Our team is executing well against its strategic plan. We remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share as the underlying market conditions continue to stabilize. We are optimistic at Patterson that we will finish the year strong with momentum heading into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,283806570,766314,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2",847,"Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2 percentage points for currency.
Turning to each of our segments beginning with Dental, sales were down 2.6% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. In Dental, as Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our continued consumable growth. After a strong second quarter in equipment, sales were affected in the fiscal third quarter by the late reinstatement of tax incentives for equipment purchases.
Looking at Veterinary. As a reminder, our NVS acquisition closed more than a year ago. So those results are now considered organic. Vet sales were $337.8 million, up 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, U.S. sales declined 1.9% and the U.K. sales rose 10.4% in local currency. Total Vet revenues include several items. First, as you are aware, IDEXX ships their products direct to the customers on January 1. We are replacing those products with Abaxis lines, but this does cause some disruption in the channel. That said, we are confident in the strength of our Abaxis partnership, as Scott said.
Additionally, Vet sales in the quarter reflect the impact of changes in selling arrangements on certain products from buy-sell to agency on the pharmaceutical end of the business. Regarding Medical, this unit performed well, as Scott noted. Sales in the quarter were up 2.6%, excluding currency and divestiture impacts.
Looking at margins. Consolidated gross margin was 28.5%, down 40 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 third quarter. This reflects the impact of revenue mix with lower margin veterinary revenues outpacing U.S. dental revenues.
We are pleased with our cost control efforts during the quarter. Operating expenses on an absolute basis declined by $2.5 million. On a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of the medical divestiture, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal third quarter was 19.9%, which is in line with last year's level.
To help understand margin performance, it is useful to adjust for last year's impact of the medical divestiture as well as the onetime noncash stock-based compensation adjustment, most of which was in the dental business. On this basis, consolidated operating margins expanded 20 basis points. By segment, they were improved in both Dental and Medical and were flat in Veterinary. Specifically, operating margins for the quarter were 10.7% in Dental, 3.5% in Veterinary and 11.6% for Medical.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8% versus 35.2% in the prior year. We continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. This will be in line with our annual tax rate for fiscal 2014.
Our DSO stands at 50 days, up 4 days from a year ago, reflecting the lower mix of equipment sales, which are typically not financed through our trade receivables. Our inventory turns were at 6.7 compared to 6.5 a year ago.
Also, please keep in mind a few additional items on the balance sheet. A year ago, we bought both a 1-year time deposit and a 2-year guaranteed investment contract or GIC totaling approximately $100 million. Both are similar to certificates of deposit. When the 1-year time deposit matures, the balance transfers to cash. And at the same time, the 2-year GIC moves from long-term to current assets.
Cash flow for the fiscal 2015 third quarter was basically flat at $59.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $158 million, up from roughly $150 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014.
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately $20.2 million to our shareholders in dividends. As you know, Patterson has $250 million of debt that is due in March. We are moving forward with a long-term extension of this debt facility. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.
Our CapEx in the third quarter totaled $14.3 million and included payments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. For the fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items that affect our fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Our performance in last year's fourth quarter was hurt by unusually adverse winter weather conditions and their resulting impact on utilization rates for our customers. Also, please keep in mind that we took a noncash -- I'm sorry, we took a nonrecurring severance charge in last year's fourth quarter. We're confident in our ability to close the year strong.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

As we move toward the end of our fiscal year, we remain confident in our ability to generate value for our shareholders and financially achieve what we set out to do this fiscal year through an array of strategies we have underway: enriching our product and services offerings; striving to make Patterson more efficient; investing in our people and systems; and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.
We have made significant strides with our corporate-wide information technology initiative, which is moving into the pilot phase. Our information technology investments are critical to improving scale in our business platform.
We have momentum at Patterson Medical, putting this business, like our others, on solid footing for future growth and market share gains. Lastly, we took the leadership position on an issue we care deeply about. To help protect against potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace, in January, we announced that we are formalizing our efforts to promote supply chain integrity for our dental customers. We will share more details at next week's Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the integrity of our supply chain for our dental customers.
Now with that, we'd like to take questions. I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

We're very excited about the opportunity ahead with CEREC and believe we're at a very interesting time with the technology and with the marketplace. And I really look at the opportunity around 3 areas, and it will touch on your question. Number one is the customer. We're really dealing with the next-generation of dentists that are embracing digital dentistry. Each year, those millennials become a bigger part of the decision-making part of the customer base. So we look at that as a big factor in driving future utilization. The second one, and it's a big one, is the product. Sirona just continues to innovate. You talked about the ortho expansion. And I think you'll see more things come out of Sirona that help expand all of the things that a CEREC machine can do for the customer and for the specialist going forward. Each improvement with CEREC, it becomes easier, faster and it just produces better and better dentistry. And I would also add, you have the materials innovations as well. Now the last part, and that's our part at Patterson and that's sales execution. So in terms of our commitment, our sales force is absolutely motivated, engaged in their role in helping change dentistry. And we also are willing to invest to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support the after-sales support for our customers. I would say that this goal is very important to everyone in this organization because at Patterson, we're committed to being one of the many catalysts that help CEREC reach a tipping point in the market and become the long-term standard of care in dentistry."

We believe we're on target to achieve probably around 20 basis points of margin expansion this year because while we had a tough comp in operating margins year-over-year this quarter, we actually have an easier comp coming up in fourth quarter because of, a, the weather headwinds, and then b, we took that onetime severance charge last quarter. So current year, we should end up with some modest margin expansion. Looking forward to FY '16, we continue to see opportunities to improve even further moving forward as we continue to drive operating efficiencies within the organization. And I would -- depending on the revenue levels and where the market is, we would target 20 to 30 [ph] basis points higher than that if the revenues can accelerate."

The reality is, and we've been a market leader in selling equipment for well over 20 years, is there is a bit of lumpiness and a roller coaster to dental equipment unlike consumables, which are very -- pretty easy to predict and plan against."

The January business performed to our plan, but it -- we couldn't make up for that gap that was created between early November and mid-December, which is sort of the classic time when dentists will sit down with their tax advisers and decide whether or not they're going to make equipment purchases. So it's not like those sales just moved into January. I would say January was a good month, and we're off to a nice start in February year-over-year. If there could be a potential, really nice tailwind, if the Section 179 is reinstated at a time like it usually is, which is usually early fall, we could see a very active equipment market next year in the calendar fourth quarter, the November, December time period, particularly against the backdrop where our consumables are growing nicely, our dentists are getting busier, which means their practices are performing well.

I think there's a lot of moving pieces in the margin, so let me just take your questions, one by one. As it relates to the vet segment, I think what you're seeing there is just a mix between NVS and U.S. vets on the consolidated rates. So we're up about 10 basis points over prior year consolidated. But if you look at the individual segments, which you can't see, both are up. So it's really a mix issue because NVS growth outpaced the U.S. growth this quarter. As it relates to the U.S., we might need take that off-line and just take a look at your math because I show that we're actually up on an operating margin in the dental business when I take out the ESOP, so up just slightly. I think in terms of the consumable mix, you're right. You'd expect that to drop through because of the equipment. What I would tell you is that as a result of the equipment being lower, our financing income was also lower, which is pretty profitable. So it's kind of a double whammy when we have a reduction in equipment. So my guess is that's where the delta is."

For that to happen, do think you can do it, selling the high-end CEREC system north of $100,000 or does that have to come down?

It is interesting because we do have products at multiple price points currently, and still well over 95% of our sales are at the high end because of the feature and benefits of the Omnicam and the full chairside complement as well as the return on investment. We now have almost 16,000 CEREC users in the U.S. and Canada and have an incredibly low return rate. And consistently, what you'd see is while it is a high ASP, there probably is no piece of equipment a dentist can invest in that brings a higher return to the practice and more patient satisfaction in terms of a single visit. So there's absolutely challenges in us not only accelerating to that type of rate of getting to 2,000, to 3,000, to 4,000 CEREC sales a year.

We didn't quantify it last year, but we talked about the number of days our distribution centers were closed, which were a complete anomaly to prior years. I would say here in the Midwest, we've had a very mild winter. So there definitely is some weather tailwind potential.

Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic growth plan by enriching our product and service offerings, pursuing efficiencies, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.
I am pleased to say that we made significant progress on all of these fronts. The first half of fiscal 2015 was strong for Patterson. And despite flat revenues in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, we are on track to meet our financial objectives as we move towards the end of our fiscal year. Most importantly, we are confident in the strength of our business and encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing.
As detailed in today's earning release, Patterson Companies' consolidated revenues totaled $1.1 billion, which is roughly flat compared to the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated sales are up 8.9% to $3.2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 during the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period, excluding Medical unit restructuring costs. Through 3 quarters, earnings per diluted share have risen to $1.59 from $1.50 a year ago. As Ann will note later in the call, EPS in last year's third quarter benefited from a onetime noncash stock compensation adjustment.
During the quarter, we saw several positive macro trends and made strides in all 3 of our business units. Let's take a closer look at our operational performance, starting with Patterson Dental.
Dental is our largest business, represents about 58% of our total sales. On the consumable side of dental, we once again posted solid growth with sales rising 4% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. We believe this reflects a combination of higher office visits and overall demand for dental services and the ability of our industry-leading sales force to meet the needs of our dental customers. Consumable growth continues to be supported by a steadily improving job market and consumer confidence.
On the equipment and software side of the business, we experienced a headwind driven by the uncertainty around the reinstatement of Section 179 tax benefits. This was a risk we foreshadowed in our second quarter conference call. Virtually, the entire shortfall to our internal plan occurred from early November to the December 19 time period when Congress finally reinstated the tax benefits. From December 19 to the end of the quarter, our equipment business performed at planned levels, but it could not make up for the shortfall created by the delay. We feel this was an industry-wide issue and do not see any change to our growth outlook for equipment and technology in our fourth quarter or in our new fiscal year beginning in May.
Clearly, our partnerships with equipment manufacturers are a key factor in our success at Patterson. During the quarter, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell in the basic dental equipment space. With the support of our long-time strategic partner, A-dec, we have built a reputation as the leader in selling dental equipment in North America. We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with A-dec and see many years of growth opportunities ahead for both companies. In the coming months, we will announce new relationships that will expand the offering we bring to our dentists. We have already noted the broadening of our relationship with Sirona to, over time, introduce their market-leading treatment centers to the United States market. We are excited to work with our partners to bring innovative products that enhance the productivity gains that technology affords our customers.
Patterson Dental is on the leading edge of the technology trends, the digitization of the dental office. We believe that fundamentals are in place for continued growth. Our exceptional sales, training and technical support infrastructure all position us well to capitalize on the digitization trend as it builds further momentum.
Technology investments continue to be at the top of dentists' wish lists. Tax implications aside, demand for CEREC CAD/CAM units remains healthy, and we are helping dental offices adopt and deploy this technology. As I have stated many times before, we believe that the CEREC chairside CAD/CAM platform truly has the potential to become the standard of care in dentistry.
In early January, we held a meeting in Minneapolis with roughly 400 Patterson branch managers, CEREC specialists, equipment specialists and territory representatives. The objective was to lay out our company goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020. This would double the CEREC user base in North America in the next 5 years. We will continue to work closely with Sirona to develop strategies to accomplish this goal. We will do everything in our power in terms of sales, marketing and support infrastructure to help accelerate this tremendous opportunity.
As we have highlighted on the past several calls, we are committed to further expanding our product and service offerings for our dental customers. In December, we acquired Holt Dental Supply located near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This acquisition will help accelerate Patterson Dental's reach and deepen our Midwest influence. We are delighted to welcome Holt Dental to Patterson Companies as they bring a long-standing and stellar reputation in their markets and maintain a culture much like ours, focused on accountability, integrity and customer service.
Moving on to Patterson Veterinary, which compromises (sic) [comprises] just under 1/3 of our total sales. We believe the underlying market in veterinary continues to perform well. We are well positioned in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in vet care for their pets continues to grow. You'll recall that our go-forward strategy for Patterson Veterinary is to further diversify our equipment and technical service offerings to capitalize on the favorable marketplace dynamics. Patterson brings market-leading technical service and support capabilities as well as the premier sales force.
Pet consumables increased by 3.5% in the quarter and were impacted by a sales mix shift in pharmaceutical products sold under buy-sell arrangements to those sold under agency arrangements. We are confident in our manufacturing partners' commitment to investing in innovation and are optimistic that this, along with the promising pet ownership trends, will continue to benefit Patterson Veterinary.
On the equipment side of vet, sales increased 3.5%. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator as we further drive our strategy to provide unique services that support the success of our vet customers.
We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to our new strategic partnership with Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with Abaxis' placements today. Abaxis is a leading manufacturer of point-of-care blood, instrumentation and consumables to the veterinary market as well as to medical and research customers. We are selling Abaxis' full line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited about Abaxis' products and people and are committed to securing the success of this new partnership.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, and we have made significant progress here. This business represents approximately 10% of our total company revenues. Our management team has worked hard to sharpen the focus of this business on select rehab markets, and those efforts are paying off. We are pleased that Medical delivered its third consecutive quarter of growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts. We are confident that our restructuring has created a strong platform and momentum in the business.
We are the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. Our team is executing well against its strategic plan. We remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share as the underlying market conditions continue to stabilize. We are optimistic at Patterson that we will finish the year strong with momentum heading into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,283806570,766882,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2",847,"Thank you, Scott. I'll start with some context on the top line. Naturally, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis, sales were reduced by 1.2 percentage points for currency.
Turning to each of our segments beginning with Dental, sales were down 2.6% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. In Dental, as Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our continued consumable growth. After a strong second quarter in equipment, sales were affected in the fiscal third quarter by the late reinstatement of tax incentives for equipment purchases.
Looking at Veterinary. As a reminder, our NVS acquisition closed more than a year ago. So those results are now considered organic. Vet sales were $337.8 million, up 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, U.S. sales declined 1.9% and the U.K. sales rose 10.4% in local currency. Total Vet revenues include several items. First, as you are aware, IDEXX ships their products direct to the customers on January 1. We are replacing those products with Abaxis lines, but this does cause some disruption in the channel. That said, we are confident in the strength of our Abaxis partnership, as Scott said.
Additionally, Vet sales in the quarter reflect the impact of changes in selling arrangements on certain products from buy-sell to agency on the pharmaceutical end of the business. Regarding Medical, this unit performed well, as Scott noted. Sales in the quarter were up 2.6%, excluding currency and divestiture impacts.
Looking at margins. Consolidated gross margin was 28.5%, down 40 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 third quarter. This reflects the impact of revenue mix with lower margin veterinary revenues outpacing U.S. dental revenues.
We are pleased with our cost control efforts during the quarter. Operating expenses on an absolute basis declined by $2.5 million. On a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of the medical divestiture, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal third quarter was 19.9%, which is in line with last year's level.
To help understand margin performance, it is useful to adjust for last year's impact of the medical divestiture as well as the onetime noncash stock-based compensation adjustment, most of which was in the dental business. On this basis, consolidated operating margins expanded 20 basis points. By segment, they were improved in both Dental and Medical and were flat in Veterinary. Specifically, operating margins for the quarter were 10.7% in Dental, 3.5% in Veterinary and 11.6% for Medical.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8% versus 35.2% in the prior year. We continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. This will be in line with our annual tax rate for fiscal 2014.
Our DSO stands at 50 days, up 4 days from a year ago, reflecting the lower mix of equipment sales, which are typically not financed through our trade receivables. Our inventory turns were at 6.7 compared to 6.5 a year ago.
Also, please keep in mind a few additional items on the balance sheet. A year ago, we bought both a 1-year time deposit and a 2-year guaranteed investment contract or GIC totaling approximately $100 million. Both are similar to certificates of deposit. When the 1-year time deposit matures, the balance transfers to cash. And at the same time, the 2-year GIC moves from long-term to current assets.
Cash flow for the fiscal 2015 third quarter was basically flat at $59.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $158 million, up from roughly $150 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014.
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately $20.2 million to our shareholders in dividends. As you know, Patterson has $250 million of debt that is due in March. We are moving forward with a long-term extension of this debt facility. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.
Our CapEx in the third quarter totaled $14.3 million and included payments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. For the fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items that affect our fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Our performance in last year's fourth quarter was hurt by unusually adverse winter weather conditions and their resulting impact on utilization rates for our customers. Also, please keep in mind that we took a noncash -- I'm sorry, we took a nonrecurring severance charge in last year's fourth quarter. We're confident in our ability to close the year strong.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

We have made significant strides with our corporate-wide information technology initiative, which is moving into the pilot phase. Our information technology investments are critical to improving scale in our business platform.
We have momentum at Patterson Medical, putting this business, like our others, on solid footing for future growth and market share gains. Lastly, we took the leadership position on an issue we care deeply about. To help protect against potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace, in January, we announced that we are formalizing our efforts to promote supply chain integrity for our dental customers. We will share more details at next week's Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the integrity of our supply chain for our dental customers.
Now with that, we'd like to take questions. I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

We're very excited about the opportunity ahead with CEREC and believe we're at a very interesting time with the technology and with the marketplace. And I really look at the opportunity around 3 areas, and it will touch on your question. Number one is the customer. We're really dealing with the next-generation of dentists that are embracing digital dentistry. Each year, those millennials become a bigger part of the decision-making part of the customer base. So we look at that as a big factor in driving future utilization. The second one, and it's a big one, is the product. Sirona just continues to innovate. You talked about the ortho expansion. And I think you'll see more things come out of Sirona that help expand all of the things that a CEREC machine can do for the customer and for the specialist going forward. Each improvement with CEREC, it becomes easier, faster and it just produces better and better dentistry. And I would also add, you have the materials innovations as well. Now the last part, and that's our part at Patterson and that's sales execution. So in terms of our commitment, our sales force is absolutely motivated, engaged in their role in helping change dentistry. And we also are willing to invest to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support the after-sales support for our customers. I would say that this goal is very important to everyone in this organization because at Patterson, we're committed to being one of the many catalysts that help CEREC reach a tipping point in the market and become the long-term standard of care in dentistry."

We believe we're on target to achieve probably around 20 basis points of margin expansion this year because while we had a tough comp in operating margins year-over-year this quarter, we actually have an easier comp coming up in fourth quarter because of, a, the weather headwinds, and then b, we took that onetime severance charge last quarter. So current year, we should end up with some modest margin expansion. Looking forward to FY '16, we continue to see opportunities to improve even further moving forward as we continue to drive operating efficiencies within the organization. And I would -- depending on the revenue levels and where the market is, we would target 20 to 30 [ph] basis points higher than that if the revenues can accelerate."

To the Sirona opportunity, we think there's a real nice opportunity at the higher end of the market. When you look at many of our customers who currently own CEREC machines or GALILEOS machines that are looking for tight integration of technology, those are products that we feel the United States and Canadian markets are absolutely ready for and are excited about the opportunity ahead.

In fact, I think your colleague, Elizabeth, asked me the question last quarter about guidance. And I sort of talked about strength in consumables and if we had a strong third quarter in equipment, that would push us to the upper end and we would be able to mitigate any softness. So that absolutely goes back to how we plan out the year.

If there could be a potential, really nice tailwind, if the Section 179 is reinstated at a time like it usually is, which is usually early fall, we could see a very active equipment market next year in the calendar fourth quarter, the November, December time period, particularly against the backdrop where our consumables are growing nicely, our dentists are getting busier, which means their practices are performing well.

I think there's a lot of moving pieces in the margin, so let me just take your questions, one by one. As it relates to the vet segment, I think what you're seeing there is just a mix between NVS and U.S. vets on the consolidated rates. So we're up about 10 basis points over prior year consolidated. But if you look at the individual segments, which you can't see, both are up. So it's really a mix issue because NVS growth outpaced the U.S. growth this quarter. As it relates to the U.S., we might need take that off-line and just take a look at your math because I show that we're actually up on an operating margin in the dental business when I take out the ESOP, so up just slightly. I think in terms of the consumable mix, you're right. You'd expect that to drop through because of the equipment. What I would tell you is that as a result of the equipment being lower, our financing income was also lower, which is pretty profitable. So it's kind of a double whammy when we have a reduction in equipment. So my guess is that's where the delta is."

But at the same time, this is going to be an evolving market over the next 5 years. You're going to see a lot of innovation come out of Sirona. It is interesting because we do have products at multiple price points currently, and still well over 95% of our sales are at the high end because of the feature and benefits of the Omnicam and the full chairside complement as well as the return on investment. We now have almost 16,000 CEREC users in the U.S. and Canada and have an incredibly low return rate. And consistently, what you'd see is while it is a high ASP, there probably is no piece of equipment a dentist can invest in that brings a higher return to the practice and more patient satisfaction in terms of a single visit. So there's absolutely challenges in us not only accelerating to that type of rate of getting to 2,000, to 3,000, to 4,000 CEREC sales a year. But at the same time, if you look at tipping points and adoptions of technologies, CEREC is right at that point where we believe that this technology is absolutely the future and can take off. And we're going to do everything on our end to make that happen."

At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well in each of our businesses and position the company for the future. We are pleased to report significant progress on those fronts. We decisively moved forward on our stated strategy to drive shareholder value by broadening our view of our markets and building on our strengths. That commitment took on new meaning with the announcement after quarter end of our definitive agreement to acquire Animal Health International. We also announced the potential sale of our Medical unit, which would allow us to deepen our commitment to our Dental and Veterinary businesses. Assuming we complete these 2 transactions, they will transform the strategic growth profile of the company.
In addition to these potentially transformative moves, we strove during the fourth quarter to deliver on the financial objectives we've established for the fiscal year. During the full year and quarter, we focused on execution and operating discipline across all of our businesses, and these efforts paid off. We are pleased that all 3 of our business posted healthy results during the period. Patterson Companies generated record fourth quarter results, and we have a firm foundation in place for the transformation we are pursuing.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter rose 6.7% on a constant currency basis of $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.68.
During our third quarter conference call, we had forecasted a solid end to fiscal 2015. Our performance in the fourth quarter allowed Patterson to finish the year were strong. For the full 2015 fiscal year, consolidated revenues reached $4.4 billion, up 8.7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $2.27 at the higher end of our guidance. As Ann will detail a bit later, our 2015 adjusted results exclude onetime transaction cost related to our proposed Animal Health International and Medical unit transactions.
We also stressed on our last call that we are encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing supported by a gradually improving job market and consumer confidence. We see the same conditions today and are excited about the opportunities in front of us.
I'd like now to look at Patterson Dental. Today, Patterson Dental is our largest business with nearly 60% of total sales. Consolidated sales in Dental grew by double-digits in the quarter on a constant currency basis with equipment and software sales leading the way. Sales in the equipment and software category rose more than 23% on a constant currency basis, and we are pleased with the growth and share gains in technology-oriented sales.
CEREC CAD/CAM and digital technology sales were stronger the quarter. This reflected outstanding execution on the part of Patterson Dental sales professionals and high customer interest. The pace of technology sales growth during the quarter further supports our belief that dentists are eager to invest in technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes. It also affirms the overall trend towards dental office modernization. Moreover, we believe that Sirona's innovation culture and Patterson Dental's industry leading sales, technical service and after-sales support is a powerful combination.
During the fiscal year, we significantly increased the number of users of the CEREC CAD/CAM platform as we continued towards our goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020, doubling the CEREC user base in the next 5 years. We believe that our offerings and market fundamentals and set the stage for continued growth and market share gains. As we announced in January, we are in the process of expanding our partnerships in the traditional core equipment category. Our relationship with A-dec will remain very strategic to our future growth plans. In the past weeks, we have will formally announced new relationships with and the Belmont company. Both of these partners bring unique opportunities to our sales force and customers. We are excited as well to launch the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment later in the fall.
Patterson has long been the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We see our expanded relationships creating many new growth opportunities.
Looking at dental consumables. We experienced 3.3% growth in constant currency in this category. We are confident both at the trend towards higher number of office visits and overall demand for dental services will continue and that we have the industry's -- that sales force to help our customers address this demand.
Moving out on the Patterson Veterinary, which today comprises just under 1/3 of total sales, consolidated veterinary sales were up 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 31% in local currencies. Patterson veterinary continued to growth this quarter while we progress with the transition to our new manufacturing relationship with Abaxis.
Abaxis is a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with the Abaxis placement today. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing.
Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in -- at Patterson Veterinary to take advantage of this stable-to-improving market conditions both here and in the United Kingdom through our market-leading technical service and support as well as the premier sales force.
Of course, there are compelling growth trends in the companion animal market with pet ownership and the amount spent per pet continuing to grow. The prospects for Patterson Veterinary now have the potential to get even more excited with the acquisition of Animal Health International the size of Patterson Veterinary will double. We will significantly expand our presence in the production animal market, which has its own very  promising long-term growth prospects and will create meaningful leverage across our Animal Health's platform.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit representing approximately 10% of our total sales. Medical's performance during the fourth quarter was again very solid and reflects the hard work our team has done to refine their market focus for this business and execute every day. This resulted in the fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts.
Today, Patterson Medical has a strong platform, momentum in the business and positioned in the marketplace as a global leader in the physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. We finished the year strong and carried momentum into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"

Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all 3 of our businesses.

This excludes onetime costs related to both the pending Animal Health International acquisition and the potential of Patterson Medical transaction in the 2015 period and restructuring costs in last year's fourth quarter.
Starting with the top line. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. Therefore, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.5 percentage points. From an EPS perspective, that impact was about $0.01 per diluted share.
Now turning to each of our segments beginning with dental. Dental sales improved 10.3% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. As Scott mentioned, consumables continued to grow, up 3.3% in constant currency. To put this quarter in the context, year-over-year growth for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 was 2.5%, 3.1% and 4%, respectively, so the fourth quarter growth in this category was in line with the momentum we saw during fiscal 2015.
We are excited about the expansion and technology sales during the quarter. Notably, new user demand for CEREC was strong, which helped drive up the equipment and software sales category by 23.3% on a constant currency basis.
Turning next to Veterinary. Veterinary sales were $356 million, up 2.7% in constant currency. So just keep in mind, the first full quarter impacted by the transition from IDEXX to Abaxis. You'll recall that IDEXX shifted to a direct sales model in January1. Fourth quarter result in veterinary reflected disruption created as we replace those products with Abaxis line. I also want to mention that due to seasonality, the current quarter and the first fiscal quarter of 2015 will show the most pronounced impact on revenues from the shift.
Excluding the contribution from the diagnostic sales provides a more normalized picture of growth within the veterinary segment. Veterinary sales, excluding the diagnostics change, improved 8% in constant currency and more than 10% in the U.S.
Looking at our U.K. operations, NVS. This division is performing well post integration on a local currency basis. Growth in NVS during the fourth quarter was 5%.
Onto Medical. Again, we had solid performance this quarter. This segments's fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Sales totaled $113.8 million in the quarter, up 3.7%, excluding currency and prior year divestiture impacts.
Now turning to margins. Consolidated gross margin was 29%, up 30 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 fourth quarter. This is due to sales mix during the period. Growth in higher-margin dental revenue outpaced revenue growth from lower margin veterinary by several percentage points during the quarter.
From an operating leverage perspective, we are realizing the benefits of sales at higher sales volume. Adjusted operating margins rose 70 basis points and 11.3% increase in operating profit.
Within Dental, our operating margins, excluding corporate expense, rose 50 basis points. In veterinary, operating margins helped steady year-over-year. Operating margin in our Medical unit increased 3.5 percentage points, excluding the divestiture. As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate was in 35.1% versus 33.7% in the prior year.
Our DSO remained unchanged year-over-year at 50 days, and our inventory turns were at 6.8 compared to 7.1 a year ago.
Looking at the full fiscal year. Our goal was to, execute on all of our businesses, and we delivered on several fronts. Patterson's organic growth was 4.3%, excluding acquisition, IDEXX and currency impact. We expanded our operating margins, excluding the impact of NVS, by 10 basis points. Operating cash flow improved by 34% to approximately $263 million, and Patterson returned $129.3 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.
Patterson had lower share repurchases in fiscal 2015. As it's clear now, there were important strategic reasons that prevented us from being in the market later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, share repurchases remain an important component of our capital allocation strategy.
A few balance sheet items. During the fourth quarter, we favorably refinanced $250 million in private placement debt that came due in March. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Fourth quarter CapEx totaled $18.4 million and included investments from the replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative.
For the fiscal 2016 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $60 million and an annual tax rate of approximately 35%.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are establishing our adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. I'll note that this guidance excludes approximately $0.05 of onetime training costs related to our enterprise resource planning implementation.
Regarding this initiative, we are currently in the testing phase and expect the pilot rollout of this new platform begin in late fall or early winter. Our guidance range also excludes the potential impact from the acquisition of Animal Health International and the impact of a potential sale of Patterson Medical. We intend to update our guidance ranges as these transactions unfold. We are excited at the prospects for what these 2 potential transactions could mean for Patterson. While Medical is a solid margin contributor, Animal Health International would add a much larger, more synergistic growth opportunity and a more expensive platform for enhancing our financial profile over the long term. We expect this transaction to be accretive in the first year on an adjusted basis.
Pro forma revenues for the veterinary segment are approximated at $3 billion. It will diversify the revenue mix between companion animal and production animal with production animal revenue increasing from 11% to 51% of the total for the segment.
And lastly, we see significant opportunity to grow the bottom line with between $20 million and $30 million and realize those synergies over a 3-year period. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

Our transition from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 had special significance. We immediately faced a couple of important milestones. The first is working toward a close of our agreement to acquire Animal Health International. I want to remind you",604,"Thanks, Ann. Our transition from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 had special significance. We immediately faced a couple of important milestones. The first is working toward a close of our agreement to acquire Animal Health International. I want to remind you why we are so excited about this combination.
We believe that Animal Health International is the ideal partner to create a complete platform for Patterson Veterinary. It will immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, adding a new component to our revenue mix that is tied to its own unique compelling market opportunity. Today, Animal Health International is posting better than GDP growth, and we will have the chance to build on that through cross-selling our clients -- cross serving our clients. Their experience in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complements the strength both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. And for our customers in particular, this will mean new opportunities to better serve them.
Both Patterson and Animal Health International place a premium on innovation, technology investment and high-touch customer service. Just after our recent acquisition announcement, we launched a micro-site dedicated to this transaction. PattersonAnimalHealthInternational.com. We will be using this site to provide information on the combination of Patterson Veterinary and Animal Health International as we work towards closing the transaction and move forward with the integration process.
The second milestone is potentially selling Patterson Medical. As we stated before, our goal is to find a buyer that values the performance-based culture our team has worked hard to create and one that intends to invest in the future to unlock its potential.
Moving ahead, we remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. Even with the proposed transactions ahead of us, we maintain a balance sheet that gives us a lot of flexibility. During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend. We remain committed to utilizing all the means we have at our disposal, including investments in our core business, dividends and share buybacks to create value for shareholders.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to point to other initiatives launched this year and accolades awarded to Patterson, which we are particularly proud of and that reflect our values and the unique culture we strive to maintain. In January, we stepped forward to draw awareness to potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace when we announced our efforts to promote integrity in the dental supply chain. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring product safety in the supply chain for our dental customers and represents a unique approach to industry leadership is important to Patterson. Reflecting that commitment, Patterson was named to the Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for the fourth year in a row. Patterson is 1 of only 2 companies in 2015 that have appeared on the list 4 consecutive years. Every employee in our organization should be deeply proud of this honor.
Patterson was also added to the honor roll for the 2014 Minnesota Census of women in corporate leadership. This distinction given by the School of Business and Leadership at Saint Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, recognizes Minnesota Public companies with 20% or more gender in their executive ranks and on their Board of Directors. We are grateful for this acknowledgment of our commitment to equal opportunity.
I want to thank all of our employees, customers and of course, our shareholders for their support during the successful fiscal 2015.
With that, now we'd like to take questions. Kim, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Actually, when you look at the full year, we had a mid-single digits growth in traditional equipment, which I think is a great sign that the future is really -- the first full year growth number we've seen in that category since 2010. Obviously, the digital products performed very well in the fourth quarter, really led by CEREC. And as we've said many times, we are great believers that the CEREC product is a transformational product for our customers.

Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call.At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well in each of our businesses and position the company for the future.",1139,"Thank you, Leslie [ph]. Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call.
At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well in each of our businesses and position the company for the future. We are pleased to report significant progress on those fronts. We decisively moved forward on our stated strategy to drive shareholder value by broadening our view of our markets and building on our strengths. That commitment took on new meaning with the announcement after quarter end of our definitive agreement to acquire Animal Health International. We also announced the potential sale of our Medical unit, which would allow us to deepen our commitment to our dental and veterinary businesses. Assuming we complete these 2 transactions, they will transform the strategic growth profile of the company.
In addition to these potentially transformative moves, we strove during the fourth quarter to deliver on the financial objectives we have established for the fiscal year. During the full year and quarter, we focused on execution and operating discipline across all of our businesses, and these efforts paid off. We are pleased that all 3 of our businesses posted healthy results during the period. Patterson Companies generated record fourth quarter results, and we have a firm foundation in place for the transformation we are pursuing.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter rose 6.7% on a constant currency basis of $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.68.
During our third quarter conference call, we have forecasted a solid end to fiscal 2015. Our performance in the fourth quarter allowed Patterson to finish the year strong. For the full 2015 fiscal year, consolidated revenues reached $4.4 billion, up 8.7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $2.27, at the higher end of our guidance. As Ann will detail a bit later, our 2015 adjusted results exclude onetime transaction cost related to our proposed Animal Health International and medical unit transactions.
We also stressed on our last call that we are encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing supported by a gradually improving job market and consumer confidence. We see the same conditions today and are excited about the opportunities in front of us.
I'd like now to look at Patterson Dental. Today, Patterson Dental is our largest business with nearly 60% of total sales. Consolidated sales in dental grew by double digits in the quarter on a constant currency basis with equipment and software sales leading the way. Sales in the equipment and software category rose more than 23% on a constant currency basis, and we are pleased with the growth and share gains in technology-oriented sales.
CEREC CAD/CAM and digital technology sales were stronger in the quarter. This reflected outstanding execution on the part of Patterson Dental sales professionals and high customer interest. The pace of technology sales growth during the quarter further supports our belief that dentists are eager to invest in technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes. It also affirms the overall trend towards dental office modernization. Moreover, we believe that Sirona's innovation culture and Patterson Dental's industry-leading sales, technical service and after-sales support is a powerful combination.
During the fiscal year, we significantly increased the number of users of the CEREC CAD/CAM platform as we continued towards our goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020, doubling the CEREC user base in the next 5 years. We believe that our offerings and market fundamentals set the stage for continued growth and market share gains.
As we announced in January, we are in the process of expanding our partnerships in the traditional core equipment category. Our relationship with A-dec will remain very strategic to our future growth plans. In the past weeks, we have formally announced new relationships with Eldmon Crane [ph] and the Belmont Co. Both of these partners bring unique opportunities to our sales force and customers. We are excited as well to launch the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment later in the fall.
Patterson has long been the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We see our expanded relationships creating many new growth opportunities.
Looking at dental consumables, we experienced 3.3% growth in constant currency in this category. We are confident both at the trend towards higher number of office visits and overall demand for dental services will continue, and that we have the industry's -- that sales force to help our customers address this demand.
Moving now on the Patterson Veterinary, which today comprises just under 1/3 of total sales, consolidated veterinary sales were up 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 31% in local currencies. Patterson Veterinary continued to growth this quarter, while we progress with the transition to our new manufacturing relationship with Abaxis.
Abaxis is a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with the Abaxis placements today. Patterson is selling a full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing.
Like in dental, we are well positioned today in -- at Patterson Veterinary to take advantage of this stable-to-improving market conditions, both here and in the United Kingdom, through our market-leading technical service and support as well as the premier sales force.
Of course, there are compelling growth trends in the companion animal market with pet ownership and the amount spent per pet continuing to grow. The prospects for Patterson Veterinary now have the potential to get even more exciting. With the acquisition of Animal Health International, the size of Patterson Veterinary will double. We will significantly expand our presence in the production animal market, which has its own very promising long-term growth prospects and will create meaningful leverage across our animal health platform.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit representing approximately 10% of our total sales. Medical's performance during the fourth quarter was, again, very solid and reflects the hard work our team has done to refine their market focus for this business and execute every day. This resulted in the fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts.
Today, Patterson Medical has a strong platform, momentum in the business and position in the marketplace as the global leader in the physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets.
We finished the year strong and carried momentum into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,297485978,820961,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 21, 2015",2015-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all 3 of our businesses.Note that to help clarify our underlying operating performance, I'll be discussing adjusted results f",1046,"Thank you, Scott. Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all 3 of our businesses.
Note that to help clarify our underlying operating performance, I'll be discussing adjusted results for the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2014. This excludes onetime costs related to both the pending Animal Health International acquisition and the potential of Patterson Medical transaction in the 2015 period and restructuring costs in last year's fourth quarter.
Starting with the top line. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. Therefore, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.5 percentage points. From an EPS perspective, that impact was about $0.01 per diluted share.
Now turning to each of our segments beginning with dental. Dental sales improved 10.3% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. As Scott mentioned, consumables continued to grow, up 3.3% in constant currency. To put this quarter into context, year-over-year growth for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 was 2.5%, 3.1% and 4%, respectively, so the fourth quarter growth in this category was in line with the momentum we saw during fiscal 2015.
We are excited about the expansion in technology sales during the quarter. Notably, new user demand for CEREC was strong, which helped drive up the equipment and software sales category by 23.3% on a constant currency basis.
Turning next to veterinary. Veterinary sales were $356 million, up 2.7% in constant currency. So you keep in mind, this is the first full quarter impacted by the transition from IDEXX to Abaxis. You'll recall that IDEXX shifted to a direct sales model in January 1. Fourth quarter results in veterinary reflect the disruption created as we replace those products with the Abaxis line. I also want to mention that due to seasonality, the current quarter and the first fiscal quarter of 2016 will show the most pronounced impact on revenues from the shift. Excluding the contribution from the diagnostic sales provides a more normalized picture of growth within the veterinary segment. Veterinary sales, excluding the diagnostics change, improved 8% in constant currency and more than 10% in the U.S.
Looking at our U.K. operation, NVS. This division is performing well post integration on a local currency basis. Growth in NVS during the fourth quarter was 5%.
On to Medical. Again, we had solid performance this quarter; the segment's fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Sales totaled $113.8 million in the quarter, up 3.7%, excluding currency and prior year divestiture impacts.
Now turning to margins. Consolidated gross margin was 29%, up 30 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 fourth quarter. This is due to sales mix during the period. Growth in the higher-margin dental revenue outpaced revenue growth from lower margin veterinary by several percentage points during the quarter.
From an operating leverage perspective, we are realizing the benefits of sale at higher sales volume. Adjusted operating margins rose 70 basis points, an 11.3% increase in operating profit.
Within dental, our operating margins, excluding corporate expense, rose 50 basis points.
In veterinary, operating margins held steady year-over-year.
Operating margin in our medical unit increased 3.5 percentage points, excluding the divestitures.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.1% versus 33.7% in the prior year.
Our DSO remained unchanged year-over-year at 50 days, and our inventory turns were at 6.8 compared to 7.1 a year ago.
Looking at the full fiscal year, our goal was to execute in all of our businesses, and we delivered on several fronts. Patterson's organic growth was 4.3%, excluding acquisition, IDEXX and currency impacts. We expanded our operating margins, excluding the impact of NVS, by 10 basis points. Operating cash flow improved by 34% to approximately $263 million, and Patterson returned $129.3 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.
Patterson had lower share repurchases in fiscal 2015. As it's clear now, there were important strategic reasons that prevented us from being in the market later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, share repurchases remain an important component of our capital allocation strategy.
A few balance sheet items. During the fourth quarter, we favorably refinanced $250 million in private placement debt that came due in March. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Fourth quarter CapEx totaled $18.4 million and included investments from normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative.
For the fiscal 2016 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $60 million and an annual tax rate of approximately 35%.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are establishing our adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. I'll note that this guidance excludes approximately $0.05 of onetime training costs related to our enterprise resource planning implementation.
Regarding this initiative, we are currently in the testing phase and expect the pilot rollout of this new platform to begin in late fall or early winter. Our guidance range also excludes the potential impacts from the acquisition of Animal Health International and the impacts of a potential sale of Patterson Medical. We intend to update our guidance ranges as these transactions unfold. We are excited at the prospects for what these 2 potential transactions could mean for Patterson. While medical is a solid margin contributor, Animal Health International would add a much larger, more synergistic growth opportunity and a more expensive platform for enhancing our financial profile over the long term. We expect this transaction to be accretive in the first year on an adjusted basis.
Pro forma revenues for the veterinary segment are approximated at $3 billion. It would diversify the revenue mix between companion animal and production animal with production animal revenue increasing from 11% to 51% of the total for the segment.
And lastly, we see significant opportunity to grow the bottom line with between $20 million and $30 million and realize those synergies over a 3-year period.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

Our transition from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 had special significance. We immediately faced a couple of important milestones. The first is working toward a close of our agreement to acquire Animal Health International. I want to remind you why we are so excited about this combination.
We believe that Animal Health International is the ideal partner to create a complete platform for Patterson Veterinary. It will immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, adding a new component to our revenue mix that is tied to its own unique compelling market opportunity. Today, Animal Health International is posting better than GDP growth, and we will have the chance to build on that through cross-selling our clients -- cross-serving our clients. Their experience in serving beef, dairy cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. And for our customers, in particular, this will mean new opportunities to better serve them. Both Patterson and Animal Health International place a premium on innovation, technology investment and high-touch customer service.
Just after our recent acquisition announcement, we launched a micro site dedicated to this transaction, pattersonanimalhealthinternational.com. We will be using this site to provide information on the combination of Patterson Veterinary and Animal Health International as we work towards closing the transaction and move forward with the integration process.
The second milestone is potentially selling Patterson Medical. As we stated before, our goal is to find a buyer that values the performance-based culture our team has worked hard to create and one that intends to invest in the future to unlock its potential.
Moving ahead, we remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. Even with the proposed transactions ahead of us, we maintain a balance sheet that gives us a lot of flexibility. During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend. We remain committed to utilizing all the means we have at our disposal, including investments in our core business, dividends and share buybacks to create value for shareholders.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to point to other initiatives launched this year and accolades awarded to Patterson, which we are particularly proud of and that reflect our values and the unique culture we strive to maintain. In January, we stepped forward to draw awareness to potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace when we announced our efforts to promote integrity in the dental supply chain. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring product safety in the supply chain for our dental customers and represents a unique approach to industry leadership that's important to Patterson. Reflecting that commitment, Patterson was named to the Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for the fourth year in a row. Patterson is 1 of only 2 companies in 2015 that have appeared on the list 4 consecutive years. Every employee in our organization should be deeply proud of this honor.
Patterson was also added to the Honor Roll for the 2014 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership. This distinction, given by the School of Business and Leadership at Saint Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, recognizes Minnesota public companies with 20% or more gender diversity in their executive ranks and on their Board of Directors. We are grateful for this acknowledgment of our commitment to equal opportunity.
I want to thank all of our employees, customers and, of course, our shareholders for their support during the successful fiscal 2015.
With that, now, we'd like to take questions. Kim, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Actually, when you look at the full year, we had a mid-single-digits growth in traditional equipment, which, I think, is a great sign that the future is really -- the first full year growth number we've seen in that category since 2010. Obviously, the digital products performed very well in the fourth quarter, really led by CEREC. And as we've said many times, we are great believers that the CEREC product is a transformational product for our customers.

And the team has done a very good job at that. I was just with the sales force this week at the national sales meeting in Chicago on Tuesday, and I would say there is a lot of excitement and momentum and spirit in that business. So as we talked about, it is a potential sale. They have a very solid game plan in front of them. They're executing well, and I don't see that stopping.

So is that the right way to look about it? And if so, with the end markets improving, Scott, would we see sort of a step-down in EPS growth in '16 relative to '15?"

First, I think as you walk through with me with some of your assumptions on interest expense -- I mean, extra week, I think you're a bit heavy on bulk of those in terms of the rate that we were able to refinance the debt at as well as some of your assumptions around the extra week. So maybe that's something we can kind of take offline. So what I would tell you is, I think you've got pretty rich estimates in there for those. I would say that similar to last year, we did build some conservatism into our guidance. So I would say there is more upside potential than downside risk in the range that we've put out today similar to last year, and we've tried to share with you the various items that can affect it one way or the other. But I would just close by saying our expectation is to absolutely turn in a strong performance for next fiscal year."

But now I have many multiple options for customers, and I think we're very excited in terms of sort of creating new markets potentially with the Sirona brand once they get everything through, get all their approvals through. And we think that'll happen in the fall. So I don't see it as being much of a speed bump at all. If anything, I think it potentially could be a very strong year for the whole core equipment line."

Welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call.At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well in each of our businesses and position the company for the future.

At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well in each of our businesses and position the company for the future. We are pleased to report significant progress on those fronts. We decisively moved forward on our stated strategy to drive shareholder value by broadening our view of our markets and building on our strengths. That commitment took on new meaning with the announcement after quarter end of our definitive agreement to acquire Animal Health International. We also announced the potential sale of our Medical unit, which would allow us to deepen our commitment to our dental and veterinary businesses. Assuming we complete these 2 transactions, they will transform the strategic growth profile of the company.
In addition to these potentially transformative moves, we strove during the fourth quarter to deliver on the financial objectives we had established for the fiscal year. During the full year and quarter, we focused on execution and operating discipline across all of our businesses, and these efforts paid off. We are pleased that all 3 of our businesses posted healthy results during the period. Patterson Companies generated record fourth quarter results, and we have a firm foundation in place for the transformation we are pursuing.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter rose 6.7% on a constant currency basis of $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.68.
During our third quarter conference call, we have forecasted a solid end to fiscal 2015. Our performance in the fourth quarter allowed Patterson to finish the year strong. For the full 2015 fiscal year, consolidated revenues reached $4.4 billion, up 8.7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $2.27, at the higher end of our guidance. As Ann will detail a bit later, our 2015 adjusted results exclude onetime transaction costs related to our proposed Animal Health International and medical unit transactions.
We also stressed on our last call that we are encouraged by the stable-to-strengthening market conditions we are witnessing supported by a gradually improving job market and consumer confidence. We see the same conditions today and are excited about the opportunities in front of us.
I'd like now to look at Patterson Dental. Today, Patterson Dental is our largest business with nearly 60% of total sales. Consolidated sales in dental grew by double digits in the quarter on a constant currency basis with equipment and software sales leading the way. Sales in the equipment and software category rose more than 23% on a constant currency basis, and we are pleased with the growth and share gains in technology-oriented sales.
CEREC CAD/CAM and digital technology sales were stronger in the quarter. This reflected outstanding execution on the part of Patterson Dental sales professionals and high customer interest. The pace of technology sales growth during the quarter further supports our belief that dentists are eager to invest in technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes. It also affirms the overall trend towards dental office modernization. Moreover, we believe that Sirona's innovation culture and Patterson Dental's industry-leading sales, technical service and after-sales support is a powerful combination.
During the fiscal year, we significantly increased the number of users of the CEREC CAD/CAM platform as we continued towards our goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020, doubling the CEREC user base in the next 5 years. We believe that our offerings and market fundamentals set the stage for continued growth and market share gains.
As we announced in January, we are in the process of expanding our partnerships in the traditional core equipment category. Our relationship with A-dec will remain very strategic to our future growth plans. In the past weeks, we have formally announced new relationships with Eldmon Crane [ph] and the Belmont Co. Both of these partners bring unique opportunities to our sales force and customers. We are excited as well to launch the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment later in the fall.
Patterson has long been the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We see our expanded relationships creating many new growth opportunities.
Looking at dental consumables, we experienced 3.3% growth in constant currency in this category. We are confident both that the trend towards higher number of office visits and overall demand for dental services will continue, and that we have the industry's -- that sales force to help our customers address this demand.
Moving now onto Patterson Veterinary, which today comprises just under 1/3 of total sales, consolidated veterinary sales were up 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 31% in local currencies. Patterson Veterinary continued to growth this quarter, while we progress with the transition to our new manufacturing relationship with Abaxis.
Abaxis is a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with the Abaxis placements to-date. Patterson is selling a full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing.
Like in dental, we are well positioned today in -- at Patterson Veterinary to take advantage of this stable-to-improving market conditions, both here and in the United Kingdom, through our market-leading technical service and support as well as the premier sales force.
Of course, there are compelling growth trends in the companion animal market with pet ownership and the amount spent per pet continuing to grow. The prospects for Patterson Veterinary now have the potential to get even more exciting. With the acquisition of Animal Health International, the size of Patterson Veterinary will double. We will significantly expand our presence in the production animal market, which has its own very promising long-term growth prospects and will create meaningful leverage across our animal health platform.
Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit representing approximately 10% of our total sales. Medical's performance during the fourth quarter was again very solid and reflects the hard work our team has done to refine their market focus for this business and execute every day. This resulted in the fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth, excluding currency and divestiture impacts.
Today, Patterson Medical has a strong platform, momentum in the business and position in the marketplace as the global leader in the physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets.
We finished the year strong and carried momentum into fiscal year 2016.
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,297485978,821022,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 21, 2015",2015-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all 3 of our businesses.Note that to help clarify our underlying operating performance, I'll be discussing adjusted results f",1045,"Thank you, Scott. Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all 3 of our businesses.
Note that to help clarify our underlying operating performance, I'll be discussing adjusted results for the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2014. This excludes onetime costs related to both the pending Animal Health International acquisition and the potential Patterson Medical transaction in the 2015 period and restructuring costs in last year's fourth quarter.
Starting with the top line. About 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. Therefore, foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.5 percentage points. From an EPS perspective, that impact was about $0.01 per diluted share.
Now turning to each of our segments beginning with dental. Dental sales improved 10.3% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. As Scott mentioned, consumables continued to grow, up 3.3% in constant currency. To put this quarter into context, year-over-year growth for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 was 2.5%, 3.1% and 4%, respectively, so the fourth quarter growth in this category was in line with the momentum we saw during fiscal 2015.
We are excited about the expansion in technology sales during the quarter. Notably, new user demand for CEREC was strong, which helped drive up the equipment and software sales category by 23.3% on a constant currency basis.
Turning next to veterinary. Veterinary sales were $356 million, up 2.7% in constant currency. So you keep in mind, this is the first full quarter impacted by the transition from IDEXX to Abaxis. You'll recall that IDEXX shifted to a direct sales model on January 1. Fourth quarter results in veterinary reflect the disruption created as we replace those products with the Abaxis line. I also want to mention that due to seasonality, the current quarter and the first fiscal quarter of 2016 will show the most pronounced impact on revenues from the shift. Excluding the contribution from the diagnostic sales provides a more normalized picture of growth within the veterinary segment. Veterinary sales, excluding the diagnostics change, improved 8% in constant currency and more than 10% in the U.S.
Looking at our U.K. operation, NVS, this division is performing well post integration on a local currency basis. Growth in NVS during the fourth quarter was 5%.
On to Medical. Again, we had solid performance this quarter; the segment's fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Sales totaled $113.8 million in the quarter, up 3.7%, excluding currency and prior year divestiture impacts.
Now turning to margins. Consolidated gross margin was 29%, up 30 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 fourth quarter. This is due to sales mix during the period. Growth in the higher-margin dental revenue outpaced revenue growth from lower margin veterinary by several percentage points during the quarter.
From an operating leverage perspective, we are realizing the benefits of scale at higher sales volume. Adjusted operating margins rose 70 basis points, an 11.3% increase in operating profit.
Within dental, our operating margins, excluding corporate expense, rose 50 basis points.
In veterinary, operating margins held steady year-over-year.
Operating margin in our medical unit increased 3.5 percentage points, excluding the divestitures.
As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.1% versus 33.7% in the prior year.
Our DSO remained unchanged year-over-year at 50 days, and our inventory turns were at 6.8 compared to 7.1 a year ago.
Looking at the full fiscal year, our goal was to execute in all of our businesses, and we delivered on several fronts. Patterson's organic growth was 4.3%, excluding acquisition, IDEXX and currency impacts. We expanded our operating margins, excluding the impact of NVS, by 10 basis points. Operating cash flow improved by 34% to approximately $263 million, and Patterson returned $129.3 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.
Patterson had lower share repurchases in fiscal 2015. As it's clear now, there were important strategic reasons that prevented us from being in the market later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, share repurchases remain an important component of our capital allocation strategy.
A few balance sheet items. During the fourth quarter, we favorably refinanced $250 million in private placement debt that came due in March. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Fourth quarter CapEx totaled $18.4 million and included investments from normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative.
For the fiscal 2016 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $60 million and an annual tax rate of approximately 35%.
Finally, as you saw in our release, we are establishing our adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. I'll note that this guidance excludes approximately $0.05 of onetime training costs related to our enterprise resource planning implementation.
Regarding this initiative, we are currently in the testing phase and expect the pilot rollout of this new platform to begin in late fall or early winter. Our guidance range also excludes the potential impacts from the acquisition of Animal Health International and the impacts of a potential sale of Patterson Medical. We intend to update our guidance ranges as these transactions unfold. We are excited at the prospects for what these 2 potential transactions could mean for Patterson. While medical is a solid margin contributor, Animal Health International would add a much larger, more synergistic growth opportunity and a more expansive platform for enhancing our financial profile over the long term. We expect this transaction to be accretive in the first year on an adjusted basis.
Pro forma revenues for the veterinary segment are approximated at $3 billion. It would diversify the revenue mix between companion animal and production animal with production animal revenue increasing from 11% to 51% of the total for the segment.
And lastly, we see significant opportunity to grow the bottom line with between $20 million and $30 million and realize those synergies over a 3-year period.
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

Our transition from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 had special significance. We immediately faced a couple of important milestones. The first is working toward a close of our agreement to acquire Animal Health International. I want to remind you why we are so excited about this combination.
We believe that Animal Health International is the ideal partner to create a complete platform for Patterson Veterinary. It will immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, adding a new component to our revenue mix that is tied to its own unique compelling market opportunity. Today, Animal Health International is posting better than GDP growth, and we will have the chance to build on that through cross-selling our clients -- cross-serving our clients. Their experience in serving beef, dairy cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. And for our customers, in particular, this will mean new opportunities to better serve them. Both Patterson and Animal Health International place a premium on innovation, technology investment and high-touch customer service.
Just after our recent acquisition announcement, we launched a micro site dedicated to this transaction, pattersonanimalhealthinternational.com. We will be using this site to provide information on the combination of Patterson Veterinary and Animal Health International as we work towards closing the transaction and move forward with the integration process.
The second milestone is potentially selling Patterson Medical. As we stated before, our goal is to find a buyer that values the performance-based culture our team has worked hard to create and one that intends to invest in the future to unlock its potential.
Moving ahead, we remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. Even with the proposed transactions ahead of us, we maintain a balance sheet that gives us a lot of flexibility. During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend. We remain committed to utilizing all the means we have at our disposal, including investments in our core business, dividends and share buybacks to create value for our shareholders.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to point to other initiatives launched this year and accolades awarded to Patterson, which we are particularly proud of and that reflect our values and the unique culture we strive to maintain. In January, we stepped forward to draw awareness to potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace when we announced our efforts to promote integrity in the dental supply chain. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring product safety in the supply chain for our dental customers and represents a unique approach to industry leadership that's important to Patterson. Reflecting that commitment, Patterson was named to the Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for the fourth year in a row. Patterson is 1 of only 2 companies in 2015 that have appeared on the list 4 consecutive years. Every employee in our organization should be deeply proud of this honor.
Patterson was also added to the Honor Roll for the 2014 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership. This distinction, given by the School of Business and Leadership at Saint Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, recognizes Minnesota public companies with 20% or more gender diversity in their executive ranks and on their Board of Directors. We are grateful for this acknowledgment of our commitment to equal opportunity.
I want to thank all of our employees, customers and, of course, our shareholders for their support during the successful fiscal 2015.
With that, now we'd like to take questions. Kim, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Actually, when you look at the full year, we had a mid-single-digits growth in traditional equipment, which I think is a great sign that the future is really -- the first full year growth number we've seen in that category since 2010. Obviously, the digital products performed very well in the fourth quarter, really led by CEREC.

You look at the new technology rollouts that Sirona did at the IDS meeting in Germany in March, the additional modality improvements to CEREC. We have a CEREC 30 anniversary event in Las Vegas, which I think will serve as a catalyst.

Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impact can be found in this morning's press release.
Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments, which organizes our legacy Veterinary business and recent acquisition into one Animal Health segment and move certain centralized share functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment into a separate corporate segment.

Welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goals to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth",1530,"Thank you, Leslie. Welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goals to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in 2 transactions: the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical. 
I am pleased to say that the thoughtful measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focused and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter. 
During the quarter, we began the all important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete. 
In particular, it's apparent that our organizations clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential to success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results-driven, which has helped to make our early integration efforts very smooth. And like in our team, they have a highly motivated sales team that's driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy road map that matches our assumptions at the outset of the transaction, and we believe we are executing against it.
During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business, where we integrated our 2 sales forces and the production animal side. Further, we made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of a broader product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps who call on mix practices. Given that we are only 2 months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.
During the quarter, we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allow us to dedicate our entire focus to the 2 highly promising end markets we have chosen. I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter, and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.
In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts in the financial picture as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continuing operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.
The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1. Stable to strengthening market conditions, the gradually improving job market and the long-term trends for ever higher global animal protein demands give us confidence that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near- and long-term growth. 
Now let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. Dental, which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth, excluding the extra week, was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth. 
On the equipment side, you'll recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand softened slightly in the first quarter, and during the period, we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force. 
As far as our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plans. But we are bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with companies such as Pelton & Crane, The Belmont Company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall. These, along with our existing partners, gives us a great portfolio of products to present our dental customers as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately 2/3 of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in a strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.
Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We're excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come. 
We are certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter in technology-oriented sales and at the same time, are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5,000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high priority [indiscernible] of investment. We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. 
One of the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in Dental is to restructure ever management team. Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental, with responsibility for all North American Dental operations. Dave formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental and leads our U.S. sales, branch and technical service infrastructure. John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our next-generation systems initiative as Vice President of NGS and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on this vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years. 
Josh formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies, reporting directly to me. Tim is responsible for driving the company-wide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our Dental and Animal Health businesses. 
These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities. We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in Dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force to advance make us encouraged by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.
Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in Animal Health to more fully capture the opportunities before us. 
In companion animal, the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue. Add to this the long-term global acceleration and demand for animal protein and we have now more catalysts for growth in diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur. 
Animal sales -- Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we are just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance in growth in the production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan, and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market. 
Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by flea and tick season in the U.K. that was less than tense this year than last, which ultimately provided the tougher comparable. 
Equipment and technology will continue be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
As you know, IDEXX adopted a direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, and we are pleased with the stability in our Abaxis placements. All in all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"

They are as follows: the definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS. 
The closing of our Animal Health International acquisition added 1.5 months contribution to our animal health segment. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance. Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional week. 
Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussion to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash. Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related onetime costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses and the cash repatriation tax cost I just mentioned.
Now to our top and bottom line. Reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. 
On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued medical operation and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.
Now a look at results in Dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in Dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. 
As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC users. Their sales were up high single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis. This reflects some disruptions from adding new manufacturing relationships to our offering. Due to factors such as time from order to installation, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.
Turning next to our animal health segment. Here, references to organic sales will exclude, where relevant, the extra week, the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors: first, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period and they are performing on plan. Sales from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Now turning to margins. It's important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter, due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan. Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. 
Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses mainly due to the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit, including the acquisition, increased to 20.7%.
In Dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year. In the animal health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the animal health segment declined 60 basis points, mainly due to 2 factors: the first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K., reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed; the second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with 1 large customer in the U.K. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the animal health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period.
Now I'd like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the Medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances. We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies, with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million. It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on the revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.
A few balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million [ph] in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter end and the extra week, which increased accounts payable disbursements between this year's first quarter and the prior year's quarter. We expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments from normal replacements as well as appropriate information technology initiative. For the full fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buybacks, dividends and additional investments in our businesses. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operations basis on which we now report. Previously, we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contributions from Dental, our legacy Veterinary business and Patterson Medical. As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of Medical. 
Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued Medical business, Patterson's prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance. 
With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including 10.5 months of operations from Animal Health International. So on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. Our guidance range excludes transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and cash repatriation. 
All in all, while I know this has a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company, focused on dental and animal health. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

The success of any transformation really hinges on the commitment, enthusiasm and ambition of those involved. These qualities have to come together right at the outset. I'm deeply proud to say that the employees and leaders of Patterson Companies and Animal Health International have and continue to rise to the occasion and stay focused on success. 
Many of you will get the opportunity to hear from these leaders who are transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come but please mark your calendars.
So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve. In Dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading sales force, puts us in a solid position for growth this year. 
In our animal health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build a comprehensive platform in the production animal industry. They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in companion animal and markets. 
Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health International experience with its own initiatives will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards the implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results. 
Now with that, we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back over to Catherine. Thank you."

So on that, I'm excited. The diagnostic front, I would say, we continue to make progress, and as I've said many, many times, this will be a long-term game for us. We're absolutely committed to being a major partner for Abaxis and driving those technologies.

Just to quantify, you asked for the quantification and the impact of the diagnostic change. Net, if you pull out the net impact of the diagnostics and the switch, it hurt reported revenue growth by about 5% or 5 percentage points. And then with regard to the bad debt, it was a $4 million write-off in U.S. dollars and it reduced the animal health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say it was with 1 large customer, as I mentioned in my remarks. And I would say there weren't really any huge at play The business was never delinquent because they're actually paying while we were deducting directly from their bank account. With that said, anytime you have an expense like this, you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve them where you can. But I would just say all businesses incurs some bad debt expense in a normal course of business. It's just a risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. animal health business is that there's a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it's a little more impactful and painful unfortunately."

And that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the 2 transactions. So since the closing did not close simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost does hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. So Medical sold out for a full 12 months. That's the $0.42 to $0.44. And then AHI's only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that, net of interest expense and synergies but excluding deal amortization, at between $0.36 and $0.39. And then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way I would characterize it is the prior deal amortization helps us by $0.07, and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06.

So caution I would give you're moving that run rate forward."

Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 first quarter, which exclude the impact of onetime transaction-related costs, deal amortization, nonrecurring training costs related to our IT initiative, tax costs related to cash repatriation and currency. 
Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impact can be found in this morning's press release.
Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments, which organizes our legacy Veterinary business and recent acquisition into one Animal Health segment and move certain centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment into a separate corporate segment.

Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goals to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in 2 transactions: the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical. I am pleased to say that the thoughtful, measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focused and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter. 
During the quarter, we began the all-important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete.  In particular, it's apparent that our organizations clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential to success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results-driven, which has helped to make our early integration efforts very smooth. And like in our team, they have a highly motivated sales team that's driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy road map that matches our assumptions at the outset of the transaction, and we believe we are executing against it.
During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business, where we integrated our 2 sales forces, and the production animal side. Further, we made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of a broader product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps who call on mixed practices. Given that we are only 2 months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.
During the quarter, we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allow us to dedicate our entire focus to the 2 highly promising end markets we have chosen. I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter, and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.
In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts in the financial picture, as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continuing operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.
The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1. Stable to strengthening market conditions, a gradually improving job market and the long-term trends toward ever-higher global animal protein demands give us confidence that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near- and long-term growth. 
Now let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. Dental, which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth excluding the extra week was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth. 
On the equipment side, you'll recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand softened slightly in the first quarter, and during the period, we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force. 
Of course, our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plans. But we are bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with companies such as Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall. These, along with our existing partners, give us a great portfolio of products to present to our dental customers as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately 2/3 of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in a strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.
Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We are excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come. 
We are certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter in technology-oriented sales and, at the same time, are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5,000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high-priority area of investment. We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. 
One of the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in Dental is to restructure our management team. Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental, with responsibility for all North American Dental operations. Dave Misiak, formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental and leads our U.S. sales, branch and technical service infrastructure. John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our next-generation systems initiative as Vice President of NGS and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on this vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years. Josh Killian, formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim Rogan, formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies, reporting directly to me. Tim is responsible for driving the company-wide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our Dental and Animal Health businesses. 
These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities. We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in Dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force to advance make us encouraged by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.
Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in Animal Health to more fully capture the opportunities before us. 
In companion animal, the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue. Add to this the long-term global acceleration and demand for animal protein, and we have now more catalysts for growth and diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur. 
Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we are just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance and growth in the production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan, and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market. 
Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by a flea and tick season in the U.K. that was less intense this year than last, which ultimately provided a tougher comparable. 
Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
As you know, IDEXX adopted a direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, and we are pleased with the stability in our Abaxis placements. All in all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,304240155,862883,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Of course, we have some added complexity in our results related to a number of items. Therefore, I will be concentrating my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the transformed Patterson Companies. 
It's helpful to run through the main items that shaped the character of the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. They are as follows. The definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS. The closing of our Animal Health International acquisition added 1.5 months contribution to our Animal Health segment. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance. Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional week. 
Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussion to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash. Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related onetime costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses and the cash repatriation tax cost I just mentioned.
Now to our top and bottom line. Reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%. 
On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued Medical operation and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.
Now a look at results in Dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in Dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. 
As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core equipment offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC by new users. CEREC sales were up high single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis. This reflects some disruptions from adding new manufacturing relationships to our offering. Due to factors such as time from order to installation, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Here, references to organic sales will exclude, where relevant, the extra week, the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. First, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period, and they are performing on plan. Sales from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Now turning to margins. It's important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan. Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. 
From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses mainly due to the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit including the acquisition increased 20.7%.
In Dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the Animal Health segment declined 60 basis points mainly due to 2 factors. The first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K., reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed. The second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with one large customer in the U.K. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period.
Now I'd like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the Medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances. We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies, with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million. It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on a revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.
A few balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter-end and the extra week, which increased accounts payable disbursements between this year's first quarter and the prior year's quarter. We expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as a corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the full fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buyback, dividends and additional investments in our businesses. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operation basis on which we now report. Previously, we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contributions from Dental, our legacy Veterinary business and Patterson Medical. As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of Medical. 
Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued Medical business, Patterson's prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance. With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including 10.5 months of operations from Animal Health International. So on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. Our guidance range excludes transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and cash repatriation. 
All in all, while I know this is a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company, focused on Dental and Animal Health. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

The success of any transformation really hinges on the commitment, enthusiasm and ambition of those involved. These qualities have to come together right at the outset. I'm deeply proud to say that the employees and leaders of Patterson Companies and Animal Health International have and continue to rise to the occasion and stay focused on success. 
Many of you will get the opportunity to hear from these leaders who are transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come, but please mark your calendars.
So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our new organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve. In Dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading sales force, puts us in a solid position for growth this year. 
In our Animal Health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build a comprehensive platform in the production animal industry. They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. 
Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health's international experience with its own such initiative will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results. 
Now with that, we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back to Catherine. Thank you."

And then with regard to the bad debt, it was a $4 million write-off in U.S. dollars, and it reduced the Animal Health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say it was with one large customer, as I mentioned in my remarks. And I would say there weren't really any huge red flags. The business was never delinquent because they were actually paying where we were deducting directly from their bank account. With that said, anytime you have an expense like this, you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve them where you can. But I would say all businesses incur some bad debt expense in the normal course of business. It's just a risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. Animal Health business is that there's a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it's a little more impactful and painful, unfortunately."

And that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the 2 transactions. So since the closings did not close simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost us or hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. So Medical sold out for a full 12 months. That's the $0.42 to $0.44. And then AHI's only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that, net of interest expense and synergies but excluding deal amortization, at between $0.36 and $0.39. And then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way I would characterize it is the prior deal amortization helps us by $0.07, and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06.

Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goals to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in 2 transactions: the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical. I am pleased to say that the thoughtful, measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focused and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter. 
During the quarter, we began the all-important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete.  In particular, it's apparent that our organizations clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential to success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results-driven, which has helped to make our early integration efforts very smooth. And like in our team, they have a highly motivated sales team that's driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy road map that matches our assumptions at the outset of the transaction, and we believe we are executing against it.
During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business, where we integrated our 2 sales forces, and the production animal side. Further, we made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of a broader product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps who call on mixed practices. Given that we are only 2 months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.
During the quarter, we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allow us to dedicate our entire focus to the 2 highly promising end markets we have chosen. I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter, and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.
In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts in the financial picture, as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continuing operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.
The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1. Stable to strengthening market conditions, a gradually improving job market and the long-term trends toward ever-higher global animal protein demands give us confidence that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near- and long-term growth. 
Now let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. Dental, which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth excluding the extra week was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth. 
On the equipment side, you'll recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand softened slightly in the first quarter, and during the period, we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force. 
Of course, our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plans. But we are bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with companies such as Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall. These, along with our existing partners, give us a great portfolio of products to present to our dental customers as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately 2/3 of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in a strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.
Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We are excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come. 
We are certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter in technology-oriented sales and, at the same time, are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5,000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high-priority area of investment. We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. 
One of the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in Dental is to restructure our management team. Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental, with responsibility for all North American Dental operations. Dave Misiak, formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental and leads our U.S. sales, branch and technical service infrastructure. John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our next-generation systems initiative as Vice President of NGS and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on this vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years. Josh Killian, formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim Rogan, formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies, reporting directly to me. Tim is responsible for driving the company-wide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our Dental and Animal Health businesses. 
These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities. We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in Dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force to advance make us encouraged by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.
Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in Animal Health to more fully capture the opportunities before us. 
In companion animal, the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue. Add to this the long-term global acceleration and demand for animal protein, and we have now more catalysts for growth and diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur. 
Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we are just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance and growth in the production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan, and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market. 
Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by a flea and tick season in the U.K. that was less intense this year than last, which ultimately provided a tougher comparable. 
Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
As you know, IDEXX adopted a direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, and we are pleased with the stability in our Abaxis placements. All in all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,304240155,862885,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Of course, we have some added complexity in our results related to a number of items. Therefore, I will be concentrating my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the transformed Patterson Companies. 
It's helpful to run through the main items that shaped the character of the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. They are as follows. The definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS. The closing of our Animal Health International acquisition added 1.5 months contribution to our Animal Health segment. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance. Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional week. 
Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussion to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash. Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related onetime costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses and the cash repatriation tax cost I just mentioned.
Now to our top and bottom line. Reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%. 
On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued Medical operation and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.
Now a look at results in Dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in Dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. 
As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core equipment offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC by new users. CEREC sales were up high single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis. This reflects some disruptions from adding new manufacturing relationships to our offering. Due to factors such as time from order to installation, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Here, references to organic sales will exclude, where relevant, the extra week, the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. First, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period, and they are performing on plan. Sales from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Now turning to margins. It's important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan. Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. 
From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses mainly due to the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit including the acquisition increased 20.7%.
In Dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the Animal Health segment declined 60 basis points mainly due to 2 factors. The first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K., reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed. The second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with one large customer in the U.K. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period.
Now I'd like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the Medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances. We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies, with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million. It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on a revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.
A few balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter-end and the extra week, which increased accounts payable disbursements between this year's first quarter and the prior year's quarter. We expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as a corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the full fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buyback, dividends and additional investments in our businesses. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operation basis on which we now report. Previously, we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contributions from Dental, our legacy Veterinary business and Patterson Medical. As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of Medical. 
Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued Medical business, Patterson's prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance. With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including 10.5 months of operations from Animal Health International. So on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. Our guidance range excludes transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and cash repatriation. 
All in all, while I know this is a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company, focused on Dental and Animal Health. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

Many of you will get the opportunity to hear from these leaders who are transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come, but please mark your calendars.
So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our new organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve. In Dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading sales force, puts us in a solid position for growth this year. 
In our Animal Health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build a comprehensive platform in the production animal industry. They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. 
Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health's international experience with its own such initiative will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results. 
Now with that, we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back to Catherine. Thank you."

A big piece of acquisitions is culture fit. And I will tell you, as I spend a lot of time with our salespeople at both the national sales meeting for our companion group, where we put the 2 sales forces together, and then with our new sales reps, I couldn't be more excited about the quality of people and really an excitement throughout the organization about the size and scale and scope we have and the ability, really, to leverage so many different capabilities of Patterson Companies to really increase the experience for customers. And I've also had a chance to talk to some of our key customers about what Patterson brings to the table. So on that, I'm excited. The diagnostic front, I would say we continue to make progress. And as I've said many, many times, this will be a long-term game for us. We're absolutely committed to being a major partner for Abaxis in driving those technologies. And I would say we're pleased, but there's still a long runway ahead and room for improvement on execution in our front, and we're right on point on that.

Just to quantify, Kevin, you asked for the quantification of the impact of the diagnostic change. Net, if you pull out the net impact of the diagnostics and the switch, it hurt reported revenue growth by about 5% or 5 percentage points. And then with regard to the bad debt, it was a $4 million write-off in U.S. dollars, and it reduced the Animal Health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say it was with one large customer, as I mentioned in my remarks. And I would say there weren't really any huge red flags. The business was never delinquent because they were actually paying where we were deducting directly from their bank account. With that said, anytime you have an expense like this, you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve them where you can. But I would say all businesses incur some bad debt expense in the normal course of business. It's just a risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. Animal Health business is that there's a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it's a little more impactful and painful, unfortunately."

And then a lot of momentum coming out of CEREC 30. So I would say we're very cautiously optimistic about the dental equipment scene going forward. And as we've always said, there is a correlation between consumable growth and the stability of dental practices with our customers' willingness to invest.

And that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the 2 transactions. So since the closings did not close simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost us or hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. So Medical sold out for a full 12 months. That's the $0.42 to $0.44. And then AHI's only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that, net of interest expense and synergies but excluding deal amortization, at between $0.36 and $0.39. And then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way I would characterize it is the prior deal amortization helps us by $0.07, and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06.

Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements, are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 first quarter, which exclude the impact of onetime transaction-related costs, deal amortization, nonrecurring training costs related to our IT initiative, tax costs related to cash repatriation and currency. 
Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impacts can be found in this morning's press release.
Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments, which organizes our legacy Veterinary business and recent acquisition into one Animal Health segment and move certain centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment into a separate corporate segment.

Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goals to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in 2 transactions: the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical. I am pleased to say that the thoughtful, measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focused and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter. 
During the quarter, we began the all-important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete.  In particular, it's apparent that our organizations clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential to success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results-driven, which has helped to make our early integration efforts very smooth. And like our team, they have a highly motivated sales team that's driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy road map that matches our assumptions at the outset of the transaction, and we believe we are executing against it.
During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business, where we integrated our 2 sales forces, and the production animal side. Further, we made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of a broader product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps who call on mixed practices. Given that we are only 2 months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.
During the quarter, we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allow us to dedicate our entire focus to the 2 highly promising end markets we have chosen. I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter, and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.
In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts in the financial picture, as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continuing operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.
The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1. Stable to strengthening market conditions, a gradually improving job market and the long-term trend toward ever-higher global animal protein demands give us confidence that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near- and long-term growth. 
Now let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. Dental, which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth excluding the extra week was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth. 
On the equipment side, you'll recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand softened slightly in the first quarter, and during the period, we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force. 
Of course, our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plans. But we are bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with companies such as Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall. These, along with our existing partners, gives us a great portfolio of products to present to our dental customers as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately 2/3 of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in a strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.
Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We are excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come. 
We are certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter in technology-oriented sales, and at the same time, are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5,000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high-priority area of investment. We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. 
One of the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in dental is to restructure our management team. Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental, with responsibility for all North American Dental operations. Dave Misiak, formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental and leads our U.S. sales, branch and technical service infrastructure. John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our next-generation systems initiative as Vice President of NGS and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on this vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years. Josh Killian, formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim Rogan, formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies, reporting directly to me. Tim is responsible for driving the company-wide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our Dental and Animal Health businesses. 
These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities. We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in Dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force to advance make us encouraged by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.
Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in Animal Health to more fully capture the opportunities before us. 
In companion animal, the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue. Add to this the long-term global acceleration and demand for animal protein, and we have now more catalysts for growth and diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur. 
Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we are just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance and growth in the production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market. 
Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by a flea and tick season in the U.K. that was less intense this year than last, which ultimately provided a tougher comparable. 
Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
As you know, IDEXX adopted a direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, and we are pleased with the stability in our Abaxis placements. All in all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,304240155,862930,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Of course, we have some added complexity in our results related to a number of items. Therefore, I will be concentrating my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the transformed Patterson Companies. 
It's helpful to run through the main items that shaped the character of the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. They are as follows. The definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS. The closing of our Animal Health International acquisition added 1.5 months contribution to our Animal Health segment. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance. Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional week. 
Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussion to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash. Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related onetime costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses and the cash repatriation tax cost I just mentioned.
Now to our top and bottom line. Reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%. 
On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued Medical operation and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.
Now a look at results in Dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in Dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. 
As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core equipment offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC by new users. CEREC sales were up high single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis. This reflects some disruption from adding new manufacturing relationships to our offering. Due to factors such as time from order to installation, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Here, references to organic sales will exclude, where relevant, the extra week, the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. First, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period, and they are performing on plan. Sales from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Now turning to margins. It's important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan. Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. 
From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses, mainly due to the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit including the acquisition increased 20.7%.
In Dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the Animal Health segment declined 60 basis points, mainly due to 2 factors. The first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K., reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed. The second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with one large customer in the U.K. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period.
Now I'd like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the Medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances. We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies, with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million. It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on a revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.
A few balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter end and the extra week, which increased accounts payable disbursements between this year's first quarter and the prior year's quarter. We expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the full fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buyback, dividends and additional investments in our businesses. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operations basis on which we now report. Previously, we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contributions from Dental, our legacy Veterinary business and Patterson Medical. As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of Medical. 
Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued Medical business, Patterson's prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance. With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including 10.5 months of operations from Animal Health International. So on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. Our guidance range excludes transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and cash repatriation. 
All in all, while I know this is a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company, focused on Dental and Animal Health. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

I'm deeply proud to say that the employees and leaders of Patterson Companies and Animal Health International have and continue to rise to the occasion and stay focused on success. 
Many of you will get the opportunity to hear from these leaders who are transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come, but please mark your calendars.
So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our new organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve. In Dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading sales force, puts us in a solid position for growth this year. 
In our Animal Health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build a comprehensive platform in the production animal industry. They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in companion animal and equine markets. 
Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health's international experience with its own such initiative will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results. 
Now with that, we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back to Catherine. Thank you."

And then with regard to the bad debt, it was a $4 million write-off in U.S. dollars, and it reduced the Animal Health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say -- it was with one large customer, as I mentioned in my remarks. And I would say there weren't really any huge red flags. The business was never delinquent because they were actually paying, where we were deducting directly from their bank account. With that said, anytime you have an expense like this, you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve them where you can. But I would say all businesses incur some bad debt expense in the normal course of business. It's just a risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. Animal Health business is that there's a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it's a little more impactful and painful, unfortunately."

And then a lot of momentum coming out of CEREC 30. So I would say we're very cautiously optimistic about the dental equipment scene going forward.

And that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the 2 transactions. So since the closings did not close simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost us or hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. So Medical is pulled out for a full 12 months. That's the $0.42 to $0.44. And then AHI's only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that, net of interest expense and synergies but excluding deal amortization, at between $0.36 and $0.39. And then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way I would characterize it is the prior deal amortization helps us by $0.07, and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06.

Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months, our goal to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in 2 transactions: the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical. I am pleased to say that the thoughtful, measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focused and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter.
During the quarter, we began the all-important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete. In particular, it's apparent that our organizations clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential to success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results-driven, which has helped to make our early integration efforts very smooth. And like our team, they have a highly motivated sales team that's driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy road map that matches our assumptions at the outset of the transaction, and we believe we are executing against it.
During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business, where we integrated our 2 sales forces, and the production animal side. Further, we made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of a broader product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps who call on mixed practices. Given that we are only 2 months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.
During the quarter, we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allow us to dedicate our entire focus to the 2 highly promising end markets we have chosen. I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter, and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.
In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts in the financial picture, as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continuing operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.
The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1. Stable to strengthening market conditions, a gradually improving job market and the long-term trend toward ever-higher global animal protein demands give us confidence that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near- and long-term growth. 
Now let's take a look at our segments, starting with dental. Dental, which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth excluding the extra week was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth. 
On the equipment side, you'll recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand softened slightly in the first quarter, and during the period, we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force. 
Of course, our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plans, but we are bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with companies such as Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Co. and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall. These, along with our existing partners, gives us a great portfolio of products to present to our dental customers as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately 2/3 of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in a strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.
Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We are excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come. 
We are certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter in technology-oriented sales, and at the same time, are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5,000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high-priority area of investment. We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. 
One of the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in dental is to restructure our management team. Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental with responsibility for all North American dental operations. Dave Misiak, formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental, and leads our U.S. sales, branch and technical service infrastructure. John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our next-generation systems initiative as Vice President of NGS and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on this vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years. Josh Killian, formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim Rogan, formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies, reporting directly to me. Tim is responsible for driving the company-wide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our dental and Animal Health businesses.
These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities. We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force to advance make us encouraged by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.
Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today in Animal Health to more fully capture the opportunities before us.
In companion animal, the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue. Add to this the long-term global acceleration and demand for animal protein, and we have now more catalysts for growth and diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur.
Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we are just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance and growth in the production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan, and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market. 
Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by a flea and tick season in the U.K. that was less intense this year than last, which ultimately provided a tougher comparable. 
Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and Medical and research customers. 
As you know, IDEXX adopted a direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, and we are pleased with the stability in our Abaxis placements. All in all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?"
320186,304240155,892886,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Of course, we have some added complexity in our results related to a number of items. Therefore, I will be concentrating my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the transformed Patterson Companies. 
It's helpful to run through the main items that shaped the character of the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. They are as follows: The definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS. The closing of our Animal Health International acquisition added 1.5 months contribution to our Animal Health segment. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance. Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional week. 
Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussions to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash. Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related onetime costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses and the cash repatriation tax cost I just mentioned.
Now to our top and bottom line. Reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%. 
On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued Medical operation and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.
Now a look at results in dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. 
As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core equipment offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC by new users. CEREC sales were up high single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis. This reflects some disruption from adding new manufacturing relationships to our offering. Due to factors such as time from order to installation, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Here, references to organic sales will exclude, where relevant, the extra week, the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacturer change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. First, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season.
As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period, and they are performing on plan. Sales from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Now turning to margins. It's important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan. Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points from the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. 
From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses, mainly due to the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit, including the acquisition, increased 20.7%.
In dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the Animal Health segment declined 60 basis points, mainly due to 2 factors: The first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K., reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed. The second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with one large customer in the U.K.
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% or 5% in the Animal Health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period.
Now I'd like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the Medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances. We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million. It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on a revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.
A few balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter end and the extra week, which increased accounts payable disbursements between this year's first quarter and the prior year's quarter. We expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the full fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buyback, dividends and additional investments in our businesses. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operations basis on which we now report. Previously, we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contributions from dental, our legacy veterinary business and Patterson Medical. As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of Medical.
Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued Medical business, Patterson's prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance. With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including 10.5 months of operations from Animal Health International. So on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. Our guidance range excludes transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and cash repatriation. 
All in all, while I know this is a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company, focused on dental and Animal Health. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?"

I'm deeply proud to say that the employees and leaders of Patterson Companies and Animal Health International have and continue to rise to the occasion and stay focused on success. 
Many of you will get the opportunity to hear from these leaders who are transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come, but please mark your calendars.
So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our new organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve. In dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading sales force, puts us in a solid position for growth this year. 
In our Animal Health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build a comprehensive platform in the production animal industry. They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complement the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. 
Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health's international experience with its own such initiative will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results. 
Now with that, we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back to Catherine. Thank you."

And then with regard to the bad debt, it was a USD 4 million write-off, and it reduced the Animal Health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say, it was with one large customer, as I mentioned in my remarks. And I would say, there weren't really any huge red flags. The business was never delinquent because they were actually paying where we were deducting directly from their bank account. With that said, anytime you have an expense like this, you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve them where you can. But I would just say, all businesses incur some bad debt expense in the normal course of business. It's just a risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. Animal Health business is that there's a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it's a little more impactful and painful, unfortunately."

And the North American markets are very stable, and we're continuing, I think, to see some nice tailwinds on consumables that we're seeing right now in the summertime months as well."

The positive adjustments are on AHI and then also the shift into what I believe is a pure cash EPS number. Is there any way you can give us, on the positive side, what gets you back to the $2.40, $2.50 number in terms of breaking out AHI versus the other moving pieces?"

And you're right. First of all, I just want to kind of start by backing up and saying when we originally announced the 2 transactions, we said that the divestiture of Medical and the acquisition of AHI would be neutral to earnings, and that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the 2 transactions. So since the closings did not close simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost us or hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. So Medical is pulled out for a full 12 months. That's the $0.42 to $0.44. And then AHI's only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that, net of interest expense and synergies, but excluding deal amortization, at between $0.36 and $0.39, and then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way I would characterize it is the prior deal amortization helps us by $0.07, and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06. And you net those 2 together, and you get to the same range."

And I think the gross margins are a very -- a pretty good run rate, although, obviously, with the softer equipment sales, I would just point out, when you think about going forward, we're expecting the equipment growth to accelerate. And that mix, because there's a 30% gross margin on equipment versus, say, in the 35% range for consumables, that 5% delta can sometimes, from a mix perspective, hurt the gross margin rate.

Today's earning announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments, in addition to our dental segment as we previously described, our companion Animal business and our new production animal distribution business are reported as the Patterson Animal Health segment. Our other and more centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the dental segment are now being reported in a separate corporate segment. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time, for a period of 1 week. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson."

We have reached the midway point in a pivotal and exciting year for Patterson Companies in each of our 2 businesses: Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health. Since we completed the acquisition of Animal Health International in June, we have taken a thoughtful and disciplined approach to bring the production animal business together with our legacy companion animal operations. As all of you know, leaving key milestones is critical to successful integration. We are pleased to say that we achieved several of these milestones in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. 
During the quarter, we made substantial progress on the headquarters relocation of our new Animal Health segment and are well on our way to consolidating the segments functions in Greeley Colorado. We integrated and solidified our Animal Health leadership team. It's worth emphasizing that the combination of Patterson Veterinary with Animal Health International has led to what we believe is the strongest leadership team in the Animal Health industry. We completed the integration of our production and companion animal sales forces. We've also made significant progress in our IT systems conversions. Let me assure you that we are 100% focused on serving our customers. 
Of course, we have more milestones ahead of us. With these accomplishments under our belts, I believe that Patterson Companies is heading into the second half of fiscal fiscal 2016 with strong ability to execute and grow with momentum. In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, consolidated sales from the continuing operations rose 44% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. 
Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 27% to $0.56 per diluted share. Let me spend a few moments on things we're seeing in our business in the macro level. The market fundamentals we have experienced for the past several quarters largely continued in Q2. In dental and on the companion animal side of our Animal Health business, we saw a stable to strengthening market conditions in North America. We believe these portions of our businesses will continue to benefit from a gradually improving job market and its positive impact on consumer spending for both dental services and pets. 
When we add production animal to our business mix not only diversified our product and service offerings, but also diversified the market drivers that affect us. Our production animal business faces a different set of market dynamics and cyclical factors. As we explained in some detail during last month's Analyst Day, short-term factors can affect the timing of production and animal revenues. However, we are also now tied to the compelling long-term trend toward ever higher global animal protein demand. Demand, the U.S. lifestyle industry will play a lead role in satisfying. This brings to Patterson a promising new long-term growth catalyst. 
With that backdrop, let's take a look at our segments starting with dental. This quarter, dental represented just less than half of our total sales. Consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected several factors. First, our sales growth in consumables was a solid 3.3% in constant currency and consistent with prior quarters. We are encouraged by the stability of the consumable market and look to continue to grow our business as we help our customers grow their practices. Second, dentists continue to see technology as a high priority area of investment. Again, this quarter, we are encouraged by technology sales in particular our CEREC sales among new users. We face the significant comparison from the year-ago quarter and are very pleased we have improved over last year and we enter the calendar year buying season with high confidence. 
The CEREC 30 event in September was an important success, evidenced by the strong attendance and enthusiasm of over 6,000 dental professionals. It is clear that this growing CEREC community is not only passionate about high-quality chairside dentistry, but is also taking a leadership role in the advancement of digital dentistry. As mentioned, we saw a very strong new user demand where trade of activity to Omnicam during the quarter was lower than we anticipated. Our Bluecam customers continue to have a very high level of satisfaction with the product. 
However, we believe the benefits and growing feature differentiation of the Omnicam will create strong upgrade demand over time. On the traditional equipment side of the business, we're in the process of broadening the portfolio of products we can now offer to our customers. In addition to our valued and strategic relationship with, our wide a range of offerings now include new relationships and opportunities such as with health and crane, the Belmont company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. We are seeing early success and gaining access to more customers through this offering. 
While our revenue in this category declined moderately in the quarter, we are very pleased to have increased our unit volume across the chair, dental unit and cabinetry categories as we now address a wider range of customer needs. We are very excited to have begun training on the Sirona lines of equipment this quarter. The and entango products, allow us to offer our customers a new level of seamless technology integration in their practice. Initial reaction to the products from our sales force and customers has been very encouraging. We began installing initial sales of this product in November. 
Bottom line is, we believe no company has a more compelling portfolio of products for the dental community than Patterson. We dedicated a week in late September for our first North American dental sales meeting. This was a great opportunity to have over 1,800 Patterson salespeople get aligned on the significant opportunity in front of our customers and Patterson. Our industry best sales force is absolutely committed to advancing dentistry, growing market share and supporting our customers business needs. We are confident in our ability to build on this growth in the second half of our fiscal year where historically, the greater percentage of our sales occur. 
The breadth of our offerings and commitment to exceptional service continues to make Patterson the partner of choice for dentists investing in modernizing their practices and enhance patient experience and outcomes. 
Moving on now to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment represented about 56% of total revenues and more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our companion animal business continues to benefit from the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership and spending, setting aside acquisitions revenue contribution and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships, sales in the legacy companion animal business improved 3% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal performed very well growing organically by 5%. Like last quarter, this growth was, partially offset by a milder flea and tick season this year in the United Kingdom compared to last year. The equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 17% in local currencies. Our progress continues with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
While pleased with our Abaxis placements, which include a new full-line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in clinic testing, we know there is more opportunity in front of us and we are focused on increasing our sales effectiveness in this area. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added $414 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. 
Keep in mind what we discussed in our recent Analyst Day. When we described the factors unique to this business that can affect timing of product brand and our resulting revenue. For example, during the second quarter, cattle producers benefited from seasonably milder weather that enabled them to leave their herds in the field longer than usual. This factor delays the sales of pharmaceuticals that would need to be applied when the herds move from outdoor grazing areas to their feed lots. 
While these delays impacted sales of pharmaceutical category, our diversified portfolio of products and services help us navigate the natural cycles of our customers will experience. While we know end market pricing and customer profitability are currently soft compared to historical levels, customers only make minor spending adjustments as they manage the health of their animals over the long-term. 
Most importantly, we now possess the foremost animal production business in North America and we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market while dealing with all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we have made the progress we expected in our Animal Health segment and our optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,316565112,907751,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2015",2015-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting.

As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting. As we outlined last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few items. Namely, the divestiture of our Medical business and the acquisition of Animal Health International. Therefore, as a reminder, I will concentrate my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the newly transformed Patterson Companies. Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. 
With respect to our top and bottom line, we reported consolidated sales from continuing operations that totaled nearly $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are encouraged by the fact that organic growth on a consolidated basis was 3.3%, up sequentially from 1.8% in the first quarter. This quarter's performance also reflects a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 2%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.56. 
Now turning to margins. Our consolidated operating margins for the quarter, excluding the Animal Health International acquisitions, averaged 8.1%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was led by gross margin expansion of 120 basis points, reflecting solid margin expansion within both of our business segments. I want to point out that we achieved 40 basis points of operating margin expansion in spite of an anomalous spike in employee health insurance claims, which totaled approximately $5 million in the quarter. While these claims affected the quarter, we do not believe the impact will be ongoing. 
The Animal Health International acquisition gives Patterson a much broader base of revenue and growth opportunities but at a lower-margin. When we include the acquisitions, operating margins in the quarter declined from 8.1% to 7% and gross margins in the quarter are reduced from 27.7% to 23.8%. Year-over-year, operating profit increased 30%.
Now let's turn to our segments. In our dental segment, organic sales improved 3.1% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.3%, reflecting continued stability in this end market. As Scott noted, while overall equipment sales this quarter were up 2% and driven by technology, traditional equipment was negatively impacted by a shift in mix. We have strategically broadened our product lines with new manufacturer to offer a wider range of price points. 
CEREC sales rose double-digits among new users, demonstrating continued strength in this technology adoption. Dental gross margin were up 50 basis points over the prior year. Operating margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year after absorbing the entire incremental costs related to our national sales team. 
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Organic sales metric exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacturer change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment rose over 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. Solid growth in both U.S. consumables and equipment offering. Organic sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 5%. This was partially offset by only modest growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K., which faced a separate comparison this year due to a last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period, which totaled $414 million. With that contribution, sales from the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. Operating margins within the Animal Health segment rose 40 basis points, primarily driven by increases in operating margin in the companion animal business. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. We are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan, and fully expect to achieve previously non-synergies of between $20 million and $30 million over a 3-year period. And now for a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter of [ph] $53 million versus generating $98 million in the prior period. This swing is due to our investment in inventory for the Animal Health business and the support new equipment product launches in preparation for the peak selling season in the dental business. 
We continue to expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Second quarter CapEx totaled $24 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. 
As you know, during the quarter, we completed the sale of Patterson Medical to Madison Deere partners for $715 million in cash. This sale gave us the opportunity to quickly de-lever and we immediately applied the net proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt encouraged to help fund the acquisition of the Animal Health International. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of 221 million to our shareholders through a combination of 45 million in dividends and 176 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. 
Based on our performance and the first half of fiscal 2016, and expectation for second-half results, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets, included the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 [ph] and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. Let me reiterate due to sales pattern and equipment, we expect sales in the back half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first. 
Our guidance range excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense, deal amortization, nonrecurring IP training costs and cash costs related to cash repatriation. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments"

As I mentioned earlier in today's call, we now enter the second half of the fiscal year, which is traditionally stronger from a sales perspective. We do so from a position of strength. 
In dental, we have momentum and are optimistic that dentists will continue to place a priority on technology investments to help propel their practices to greater levels of productivity. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend for the evermore digital dental practice. Our broader equipment offerings and more diverse product portfolio now appeal to a much larger number of customers. This creates new opportunities for us that are well-timed for the second half of the fiscal year. 
In Animal Health, the integration work is going smoothly and we are pleased with the synergies we are capturing. We will continue to drive the current pace of activity. I could not be more pleased as to how our newly formed teams are working together. We believe we have the most formidable Animal Health offering in North America and the United Kingdom with strong leadership to drive this business. Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative and are on track for pilot testing over the next couple of months. 
Animal Health International's experience with its own ERP initiative has been highly instrumental in affirming our approach. We intend to diligently execute on our capital allocation strategy. In this quarter, we demonstrated confidence in our future by investing in our business, paying dividends and repurchasing shares. Together, these 3 components will continue driving long-term shareholder value. 
Before we open up the call for questions, I am delighted to welcome John Write, as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. John joins us from the twhirl company where he held a variety of leadership roles over 19 years, including time and the Investor Relations.

And in the current quarter, what happened is we saw a number of large claims, what they call catastrophic claims that were far in excess of what we've experiencing in current -- in recent years. So specifically, we saw a 35% spike in the number of high dollar of catastrophic claims, which cost us about $5 million. And to answer your question, most of that hit in the corporate segment. I don't have the exact breakdown, but most of it hit in the corporate and the operating expense line. And I think the thing that I would stress here is because of the caps of the individual limits, and just -- we think the bowling ball is to this make so to speak. And we certainly don't believe that this will be our continued run rate going forward for the remainder of the year."

Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors, which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements, are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material.

Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 second quarters, which exclude the impact of onetime transaction-related costs, deal amortization, and foreign currency.
Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release. Today's earning announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments. In addition to our dental segment, as we previously described, our companion Animal business and our new production animal distribution business are reported as the Patterson Animal Health segment. Our other and more centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the dental segment are now being reported in a separate corporate segment.

We have reached the midway point in a pivotal and exciting year for Patterson Companies in each of our 2 businesses: Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health. Since we completed the acquisition of Animal Health International in June, we have taken a thoughtful and disciplined approach to bring the production animal business together with our legacy companion animal operations. As all of you know, leaving key milestones is critical to successful integration. We are pleased to say that we achieved several of these milestones in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. 
During the quarter, we made substantial progress on the headquarters relocation of our new Animal Health segment and are well on our way to consolidating the segments functions in Greeley, Colorado. We integrated and solidified our Animal Health leadership team. It's worth emphasizing that the combination of Patterson Veterinary with Animal Health International has led to what we believe is the strongest leadership team in the Animal Health industry. We completed the integration of our production and companion animal sales forces. We've also made significant progress on our IT systems conversions. Let me assure you that we are 100% focused on serving our customers. 
Of course, we have more milestones ahead of us. With these accomplishments under our belts, I believe that Patterson Companies is heading into the second half of fiscal 2016 with the strong ability to execute and grow with momentum. In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, consolidated sales from the continuing operations rose 44% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. 
Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 27% to $0.56 per diluted share. Let me spend a few moments on things we're seeing in our business on a macro level. The market fundamentals we have experienced for the past several quarters largely continued in Q2. In Dental and on the companion animal side of our Animal Health business, we saw a stable to strengthening market conditions in North America. We believe these portions of our businesses will continue to benefit from the gradually improving job market and it's positive impact on consumer spending for both dental services and pets. 
When we added production animal to our business mix, we not only diversified our product and service offerings, but also diversified the market drivers that affect us. Our production animal business faces a different set of market dynamics and cyclical factors. As we explained in some detail during the last month's Analyst Day, short-term factors can affect the timing of production and animal revenues. However, we are also now tied to the compelling long-term trend toward ever higher global animal protein demand. Demand, the U.S. livestock industry will play a lead role in satisfying. This brings to Patterson a promising new long-term growth catalyst. 
With that backdrop, let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. This quarter, Dental represented just less than half of our total sales. Consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected several factors. First, our sales growth in consumables was a solid 3.3% in constant currency and consistent with prior quarters. We are encouraged by the stability of the consumable market and look to continue to grow our business as we help our customers grow their practices. Second, dentists continue to see technology as a high priority area of investment. Again, this quarter, we are encouraged by technology sales, in particular our CEREC sales among new users. We faced a significant comparison from the year-ago quarter and are very pleased we have improved over last year, and we enter the calendar year buying season with high confidence. 
The CEREC 30 event in September was an important success, evidenced by the strong attendance and enthusiasm of over 6,000 dental professionals. It is clear that this growing CEREC community is not only passionate about high-quality chairside dentistry, but is also taking a leadership role in the advancement of digital dentistry. As mentioned, we saw a very strong new user demand. The trade of activity to Omnicam during the quarter was lower than we anticipated. Our Bluecam customers continue to have a very high level of satisfaction with the product. 
However, we believe the benefits and growing feature differentiation of the Omnicam will create strong upgrade demand over time. On the traditional equipment side of the business, we're in the process of broadening the portfolio of products we can now offer to our customers. In addition to our valued and strategic relationship with A-dec, our wider range of offerings now include new relationships and opportunities such as with Pelton & Crane, a Belmont company, and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. We are seeing early success and gaining access to more customers through this offering. 
While our revenue in this category declined moderately in the quarter, we are very pleased to have increased our unit volume across the chair, dental unit and cabinetry categories as we now address a wider range of customer needs. We are very excited to have begun training on the Sirona lines of equipment this quarter. The  TENEO and INTEGO products allow us to offer our customers a new level of seamless technology integration in their practice. Initial reaction to the products from our sales force and customers has been very encouraging. We began installing initial sales of this product in November. 
Bottom line is, we believe no company has a more compelling portfolio of products for the dental community than Patterson. We dedicated a week in late September for our first North American dental sales meeting. This was a great opportunity to have over 1,800 Patterson salespeople get aligned on the significant opportunity in front of our customers and Patterson. Our industry best sales force is absolutely committed to advancing dentistry, growing market share and supporting our customers business needs. We are confident in our ability to build on this growth in the second half of our fiscal year where, historically, the greater percentage of our sales occur. 
The breadth of our offerings and commitment to exceptional service continues to make Patterson the partner of choice for dentists investing in modernizing their practices and enhance patient experience and outcomes. 
Moving on now to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment represented about 56% of total revenues and more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our companion animal business continues to benefit from the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership and spending, setting aside the acquisitions revenue contribution and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships, sales in the legacy companion animal business improved 3% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal performed very well growing organically by 5%. Like last quarter, this growth was partially offset by a milder flea and tick season this year in the United Kingdom compared to last year. The equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 17% in local currencies. Our progress continues with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
While pleased with our Abaxis placements, which include a new full line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, we know there is more opportunity in front of us, and we are focused on increasing our sales effectiveness in this area. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added $414 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. 
Keep in mind what we discussed at our recent Analyst Day. When we described the factors unique to this business that can affect timing of product demand and our resulting revenue. For example, during the second quarter, cattle producers benefited from seasonably milder weather that enable them to leave their herds in the field longer than usual. This factor delays the sales of pharmaceuticals that would need to be applied when the herds move from outdoor grazing areas to their feedlots. 
While these delays impacted sales in the pharmaceutical category, our diversified portfolio of products and services help us navigate the natural cycles our customers will experience. While we know end market pricing and customer profitability are currently soft compared to historical levels, customers only make minor spending adjustments as they manage the health of their animals over the long-term. 
Most importantly, we now possess the foremost production animal business in North America, and we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market while dealing with all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we have made the progress we expected in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,316565112,907860,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2015",2015-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting. As we outlined last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few i",1060,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting. As we outlined last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few items. Namely, the divestiture of our Medical business and the acquisition of Animal Health International. Therefore, as a reminder, I will concentrate my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the newly transformed Patterson Companies. Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. 
With respect to our top and bottom line, we reported consolidated sales from continuing operations that totaled nearly $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are encouraged by the fact that organic growth on a consolidated basis was 3.3%, up sequentially from 1.8% in the first quarter. This quarter's performance also reflects a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 2%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.56. 
Now turning to margins. Our consolidated operating margins for the quarter, excluding the Animal Health International acquisition, averaged 8.1%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was led by gross margin expansion of 120 basis points, reflecting solid margin expansion within both of our business segments. I want to point out that we achieved 40 basis points of operating margin expansion in spite of an anomalous spike in employee health insurance claims, which totaled approximately $5 million in the quarter. While these claims affected the quarter, we do not believe the impact will be ongoing. 
The Animal Health International acquisition gives Patterson a much broader base of revenue and growth opportunities, but at a lower-margin. When we include the acquisition, operating margin in the quarter declined from 8.1% to 7%, and gross margins in the quarter are reduced from 27.7% to 23.8%. Year-over-year, operating profit increased 30%.
Now let's turn to our segments. In our dental segment, organic sales improved 3.1% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.3%, reflecting continued stability in this end market. As Scott noted, while overall equipment sales this quarter were up 2% and driven by technology, traditional equipment was negatively impacted by a shift in mix. We have strategically broadened our product line with new manufacturer to offer a wider range of price points. 
CEREC sales rose double-digits among new users, demonstrating continued strength in this technology adoption. Dental gross margins were up 50 basis points over the prior year. Operating margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year after absorbing the entire incremental costs related to our national sales meeting. 
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacturer change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment rose over 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. Solid growth in both U.S. consumables and equipment offering. Organic sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 5%. This was partially offset by only modest growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparison this year due to a last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period, which totaled $414 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. Operating margins within the Animal Health segment rose 40 basis points, primarily driven by increases in operating margin in the companion animal business. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. We are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan, and fully expect to achieve previously announced synergies of between $20 million and $30 million over a 3-year period. And now for a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter of $53 million versus generating $98 million in the prior period. This swing is due to our investment in inventory for the Animal Health business and to support new equipment product launches in preparation for the peak selling season in the dental business. 
We continue to expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Second quarter CapEx totaled $24 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. 
As you know, during the quarter, we completed the sale of Patterson Medical to Madison Dearborn Partners for $715 million in cash. This sale gave us the opportunity to quickly de-lever and we immediately applied the net proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt encouraged to help fund the acquisition of the Animal Health International. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $221 million to our shareholders through a combination of $45 million in dividends and $176 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. 
Based on our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016, and expectation for second-half results, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets, included the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. Let me reiterate that due to sales pattern and equipment, we expect sales in the back half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first. 
Our guidance range excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense, deal amortization, nonrecurring IP training costs and cash costs related to cash repatriation. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned earlier in today's call, we now enter the second half of the fiscal year, which is traditionally stronger from a sales perspective. We do so from a position of strength. 
In dental, we have momentum and are optimistic that dentists will continue to place a priority on technology investments to help propel their practices to greater levels of productivity. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend for the evermore digital dental practice. Our broader equipment offerings and more diverse product portfolio now appeal to a much larger number of customers. This creates new opportunities for us that are well timed for the second half of the fiscal year. 
In Animal Health, the integration work is going smoothly, and we are pleased with the synergies we are capturing. We will continue to drive the current pace of activity. I could not be more pleased as to how our newly formed teams are working together. We believe we have the most formidable Animal Health offering in North America and the United Kingdom with strong leadership to drive this business. Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative and are on track for pilot testing over the next couple of months. 
Animal Health International's experience with its own ERP initiative has been highly instrumental in affirming our approach. We intend to diligently execute on our capital allocation strategy. In this quarter, we demonstrated confidence in our future by investing in our business, paying dividends and repurchasing shares. Together, these 3 components will continue driving long-term shareholder value. 
Before we open up the call for questions, I am delighted to welcome John Wright, as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. John joins us from  The Toro Company, where he held a variety of leadership roles over 19 years, including time in Investor Relations. We look forward to the expertise and dedication he will bring to this role.

And in the current quarter, what happened is we saw a number of large claims, what they're calling catastrophic claims, that were far in excess of what we've experienced in current -- in recent years. So specifically, we saw a 35% spike in the number of high dollar of catastrophic claims, which cost us about $5 million. And to answer your question, most of that hit in the corporate segment. I don't have the exact breakdown, but most of it hit in the corporate and the operating expense line. And I think the thing that I would stress here is because of the caps of the individual limits, and just -- we think the bowling ball is to this make, so to speak, and we certainly don't believe that this will be our continued run rate going forward for the remainder of the year."

Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors, which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements, are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material.

Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 second quarters, which exclude the impact of onetime transaction-related costs, deal amortization, and foreign currency.
Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release. Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments. In addition to our dental segment, as we previously described, our companion animal business and our new production animal distribution business are reported as the Patterson Animal Health segment. Our other and more centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the dental segment are now being reported in a separate corporate segment. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time, for a period of 1 week.

During the quarter, we made substantial progress on the headquarters relocation of our new Animal Health segment and are well on our way to consolidating the segments functions in Greeley, Colorado. We integrated and solidified our Animal Health leadership team. It's worth emphasizing that the combination of Patterson Veterinary with Animal Health International has led to what we believe is the strongest leadership team in the Animal Health industry. We completed the integration of our production and companion animal sales forces. We've also made significant progress on our IT system conversions. Let me assure you that we are 100% focused on serving our customers. 
Of course, we have more milestones ahead of us. With these accomplishments under our belts, I believe that Patterson Companies is heading into the second half of fiscal 2016 with the strong ability to execute and grow with momentum. In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, consolidated sales from the continuing operations rose 44% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. 
Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 27% to $0.56 per diluted share. Let me spend a few moments on things we're seeing in our business on a macro level. The market fundamentals we have experienced for the past several quarters largely continued in Q2. In Dental and on the companion animal side of our Animal Health business, we saw stable to strengthening market conditions in North America. We believe these portions of our businesses will continue to benefit from the gradually improving job market and it's positive impact on consumer spending for both dental services and pets. 
When we added production animal to our business mix, we not only diversified our product and service offerings, but also diversified the market drivers that affect us. Our production animal business faces a different set of market dynamics and cyclical factors. As we explained in some detail during last month's Analyst Day, short-term factors can affect the timing of production and animal revenues. However, we are also now tied to the compelling long-term trend toward ever higher global animal protein demand. Demand, the U.S. livestock industry will play a lead role in satisfying. This brings to Patterson a promising new long-term growth catalyst. 
With that backdrop, let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. This quarter, Dental represented just less than half of our total sales. Consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected several factors. First, our sales growth in consumables was a solid 3.3% in constant currency and consistent with prior quarters. We are encouraged by the stability of the consumable market and look to continue to grow our business as we help our customers grow their practices. Second, dentists continue to see technology as a high priority area of investment. Again, this quarter, we are encouraged by technology sales, in particular our CEREC sales among new users. We faced a significant comparison from the year-ago quarter and are very pleased to have improved over last year, and we enter the calendar year buying season with high confidence. 
The CEREC 30 event in September was an important success, evidenced by the strong attendance and enthusiasm of over 6,000 dental professionals. It is clear that this growing CEREC community is not only passionate about high-quality chairside dentistry, but is also taking a leadership role in the advancement of digital dentistry. As mentioned, we saw very strong new user demand but trade-up activity to Omnicam during the quarter was lower than we anticipated. Our Bluecam customers continue to have a very high level of satisfaction with the product. 
However, we believe the benefits and growing feature differentiation of the Omnicam will create strong upgrade demand over time. On the traditional equipment side of the business, we are in the process of broadening the portfolio of products we can now offer to our customers. In addition to our valued and strategic relationship with A-dec, our wider range of offerings now include new relationships and opportunities such as with Pelton & Crane, the Belmont company, and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. We are seeing early success and gaining access to more customers through this offering. 
While our revenue in this category declined moderately in the quarter, we are very pleased to have increased our unit volume across the chair, dental unit and cabinetry categories as we now address a wider range of customer needs. We are very excited to have begun training on the Sirona lines of equipment this quarter. The TENEO and INTEGO products allow us to offer our customers a new level of seamless technology integration in their practice. Initial reaction to the products from our sales force and customers has been very encouraging. We began installing initial sales of this product in November. 
Bottom line is, we believe no company has a more compelling portfolio of products for the dental community than Patterson. We dedicated a week in late September for our first North American dental sales meeting. This was a great opportunity to have over 1,800 Patterson salespeople get aligned on the significant opportunity in front of our customers and Patterson. Our industry-best sales force is absolutely committed to advancing dentistry, growing market share and supporting our customers business needs. We are confident in our ability to build on this growth in the second half of our fiscal year where, historically, the greater percentage of our sales occur. 
The breadth of our offerings and commitment to exceptional service continues to make Patterson the partner of choice for dentists investing in modernizing their practices and enhance patient experience and outcomes. 
Moving on now to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment represented about 56% of total revenues and more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our companion animal business continues to benefit from the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership and spending, setting aside the acquisitions revenue contribution and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships, sales in the legacy companion animal business improved 3% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal performed very well growing organically by 5%. Like last quarter, this growth was partially offset by a milder flea and tick season this year in the United Kingdom compared to last year. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 17% in local currencies. Our progress continues with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. 
While pleased with our Abaxis placements, which include a full line of veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing, we know there is more opportunity in front of us, and we are focused on increasing our sales effectiveness in this area. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added $414 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. 
Keep in mind what we discussed at our recent Analyst Day. When we described the factors unique to this business that can affect timing of product demand and our resulting revenue. For example, during the second quarter, cattle producers benefited from seasonably milder weather that enabled them to leave their herds in the field longer than usual. This factor delays the sales of pharmaceuticals that would need to be applied when the herds move from outdoor grazing areas to their feedlots. 
While these delays impacted sales in the pharmaceutical category, our diversified portfolio of products and services help us navigate the natural cycles our customers will experience. While we know end market pricing and customer profitability are currently soft compared to historical levels, customers only make minor spending adjustments as they manage the health of their animals over the long-term. 
Most importantly, we now possess the foremost production animal business in North America, and we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market while dealing with all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we have made the progress we expected in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,316565112,907922,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2015",2015-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting. As we outlined last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few i",1058,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several bright spots in Patterson Companies' financial performance in our second quarter that merit highlighting. As we outlined last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few items. Namely, the divestiture of our Medical business and the acquisition of Animal Health International. Therefore, as a reminder, I will concentrate my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the newly transformed Patterson Companies. Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales to provide a more normalized view of sales performance. 
With respect to our top and bottom line, we reported consolidated sales from continuing operations that totaled nearly $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are encouraged by the fact that organic growth on a consolidated basis was 3.3%, up sequentially from 1.8% in the first quarter. This quarter's performance also reflects a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 2%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.56. 
Now turning to margins. Our consolidated operating margins for the quarter, excluding the Animal Health International acquisition, averaged 8.1%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was led by gross margin expansion of 120 basis points, reflecting solid margin expansion within both of our business segments. I want to point out that we achieved 40 basis points of operating margin expansion in spite of an anomalous spike in employee health insurance claims, which totaled approximately $5 million in the quarter. While these claims affected the quarter, we do not believe the impact will be ongoing. 
The Animal Health International acquisition gives Patterson a much broader base of revenue and growth opportunities, but at a lower-margin. When we include the acquisition, operating margins in the quarter declined from 8.1% to 7%, and gross margins in the quarter are reduced from 27.7% to 23.8%. Year-over-year, operating profit increased 30%.
Now let's turn to our segments. In our dental segment, organic sales improved 3.1% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.3%, reflecting continued stability in this end market. As Scott noted, while overall equipment sales this quarter were up 2% and driven by technology, traditional equipment was negatively impacted by a shift in mix. We have strategically broadened our product line with new manufacturers to offer a wider range of price points. 
CEREC sales rose double-digits among new users, demonstrating continued strength in this technology adoption. Dental gross margins were up 50 basis points over the prior year. Operating margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year after absorbing the entire incremental costs related to our national sales meeting. 
Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacturer change to Abaxis. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in this segment rose over 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by 2 factors. Solid growth in both U.S. consumables and equipment offerings. Organic sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 5%. This was partially offset by only modest growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparison this year due to last year's more intense flea and tick season. 
As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period, which totaled $414 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. Operating margins within the Animal Health segment rose 40 basis points, primarily driven by increases in operating margins in the companion animal business. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. 
We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. We are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan, and fully expect to achieve previously announced synergies of between $20 million and $30 million over a 3-year period. And now for a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter of $53 million versus generating $98 million in the prior period. This swing is due to our investment in inventory for the Animal Health business and to support new equipment product launches in preparation for the peak selling season in the dental business. 
We continue to expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Second quarter CapEx totaled $24 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. 
As you know, during the quarter, we completed the sale of Patterson Medical to Madison Dearborn Partners for $715 million in cash. This sale gave us the opportunity to quickly de-lever and we immediately applied the net proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt incurred to help fund the acquisition of Animal Health International. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $221 million to our shareholders through a combination of $45 million in dividends and $176 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. 
Based on our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016 and expectations for second-half results, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets, includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. Let me reiterate that due to sales patters in equipment, we expect sales in the back half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first. 
Our guidance range excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense, deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned earlier in today's call, we now enter the second half of the fiscal year, which is traditionally stronger from a sales perspective. We do so from a position of strength. 
In dental, we have momentum and are optimistic that dentists will continue to place a priority on technology investments to help propel their practices to greater levels of productivity. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend toward the evermore digital dental practice. Our broader equipment offerings and more diverse product portfolio now appeal to a much larger number of customers. This creates new opportunities for us that are well timed for the second half of the fiscal year. 
In Animal Health, the integration work is going smoothly, and we are pleased with the synergies we are capturing. We will continue to drive the current pace of activity. I could not be more pleased as to how our newly formed teams are working together. We believe we have the most formidable Animal Health offering in North America and the United Kingdom with strong leadership to drive this business. Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative and are on track for pilot testing over the next couple of months. 
Animal Health International's experience with its own ERP initiative has been highly instrumental in affirming our approach. We intend to diligently execute on our capital allocation strategy. In this quarter, we demonstrated confidence in our future by investing in our business, paying dividends and repurchasing shares. Together, these 3 components will continue driving long-term shareholder value. 
Before we open up the call for questions, I am delighted to welcome John Wright, as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. John joins us from The Toro Company, where he held a variety of leadership roles over 19 years, including time in Investor Relations. We look forward to the expertise and dedication he will bring to this role. 
Now we'd like to open up to questions. So I'll turn the call back over to Kim."

And in the current quarter, what happened is we saw a number of large claims, what they call them catastrophic claims, that were far in excess of what we've experienced in current -- in recent years. So specifically, we saw a 35% spike in the number of high dollar or catastrophic claims, which cost us about $5 million. And to answer your question, most of that hit in the corporate segment. I don't have the exact breakdown, but most of it hit in the corporate in the operating expense line. And I think the thing that I would stress here is because of the caps of the individual limits, and just -- we think the bowling ball is through the snake, so to speak, and we certainly don't believe that this will be our continued run rate going forward for the remainder of the year."

We've said the underlying market in terms of technology growth should continue to grow at a CAGR of north of 10% and the traditional Equipment business will grow in the mid-single-digits and really one of the big catalysts that will help the traditional business is when you start seeing really a renaissance of new construction in terms of office expansion.
